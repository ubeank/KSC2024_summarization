You are an expert in analyzing medical research summaries. Your task is to evaluate a synthesized summary (Summary) based on the provided original abstracts (Source Text) from biomedical research papers and a reference summary (Target Summary). Identify errors in the synthesized summary and annotate them using HTML tags to specify all relevant sub error categories. If a segment exhibits multiple errors, include all applicable sub error categories in the class attribute, separated by spaces. Additionally, for each identified error, record the sub error categories, and provide a explanation of why the error falls under those categories.


Main Error Categories:
Completeness - The summarizer ensures the inclusion of all keyfacts from the input text in the output summary.


Sub Error Categories:
Population_Mismatch - When the group studied is different
Intervention_Mismatch - When the treatment or method differs
Outcome_Mismatch - When the results differ
Omission_of_Key_Facts - Important details are omitted

Task Instructions:
1. Understand the Error Categories: Familiarize yourself with the definitions of main and sub error categories.
2. Analyze the Summaries: 
Compare the source text with the synthesized summary and the reference summary.
Identify segments in the synthesized summary that correspond to each sub error category.
If multiple sub error categories apply to the same segment, include all categories in the class attribute, separated by spaces.
3. Annotate Errors in the Synthesized Summary: 
Use HTML tags to mark errors in the format:
<span class= "sub_error_name1" "sub_error_name2">[Error Segment]</span>.
Ensure the tags cover only the specific portion of the text where the errors occur.
4. Document the Errors: 
For each error identified, provide the following details:
Sub Error Category: Specific sub error category. 
Reason: A explanation of why the error falls under these categories and how it deviates from the reference summary.



Example:

Source Text:  
{{source_text}}

Target Summary:  
{{reference_summary}} 

Summary:  
{{synthesized_summary}}


Example Answer Format:

1. HTML-tagged Generated Summary:

2. Error Documentation
