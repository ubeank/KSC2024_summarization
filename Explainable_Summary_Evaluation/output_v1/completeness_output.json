The three-drug regimen was better tolerated, with similar relapse rates (6.6% vs. 5.6%). Less than 12 weeks of therapy significantly increased relapse risk (5.7-fold). \n\n**Imipenem vs. Ceftazidime:** In assessing intravenous therapies for severe melioidosis, there was no mortality difference between imipenem and ceftazidime. Treatment failure was more frequent in ceftazidime patients.\n\n**Cefoperazone/Sulbactam:** A controlled study showed similar mortality (around 18%) between cefoperazone/sulbactam and ceftazidime. Both treatments effectively managed severe melioidosis.\n\n**Ceftazidime + Co-trimoxazole:** Meta-analysis showed no significant difference in mortality between ceftazidime monotherapy and combination therapy with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.\n\n**Chloramphenicol vs. Doxycycline:** The conventional regimen of chloramphenicol and doxycycline outperformed doxycycline alone in maintaining melioidosis remission.\n\n**Co-amoxiclav vs. Conventional Therapy:** Co-amoxiclav was safer but had higher relapse rates (16% vs. 4%). A longer treatment duration (12-20 weeks) is advised.\n\n**Maintenance therapies:** Studies validated cotrimoxazole plus doxycycline as superior for maintenance, with ciprofloxacin/azithromycin showing higher relapse rates (22% vs. 3%).\n\n**G-CSF for Severe Sepsis:** G-CSF showed no mortality benefit in severe melioidosis patients but increased survival duration, suggesting management of metabolic abnormalities is more critical.\n\n**Ceftazidime vs. Amoxicillin/Clavulanate:** Both had similar mortality rates; treatment failure was higher in the amoxicillin group.\n\n**Recommendation:** Ceftazidime plus co-trimoxazole is preferred for severe melioidosis, with extended oral treatment duration and proper regimen selection critical for maintenance therapy. Future studies should focus on improving therapeutic efficacy and reducing adherence issues.\n```",
