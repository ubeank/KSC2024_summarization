MOXI-AF effectively eradicated major conjunctivitis pathogens: H. influenzae (98.5% vs. 59.6%), S. pneumoniae (86.4% vs. 50%), and S. aureus (94.1% vs. 80%). The formulation is effective across all ages for bacterial conjunctivitis.\n\n2. <span class=\"Length\">Fusidic Acid Trial</span>: This randomized controlled trial assessed fusidic acid gel for acute infectious conjunctivitis, revealing no significant difference in recovery rates compared to placebo after 7 days (adjusted risk difference = 5.3%).
