This addition is not directly inferable from the original text.\n\n**Error 2:**\n- **Sub Error Category:** Inaccurate_Emphasis\n- **Reason:** The summary emphasizes the effectiveness of surgical treatment in \"total nasal volume for nonpolypoid CRS,\" which may mislead readers into thinking that this is a central finding of the study.
