The three-drug regimen was better tolerated, with similar relapse rates (6.6% vs. 5.6%). Less than 12 weeks of therapy significantly increased relapse risk (5.7-fold). \n\n**Imipenem vs. Ceftazidime:** In assessing intravenous therapies for severe melioidosis, there was no mortality difference between imipenem and ceftazidime. Treatment failure was more frequent in ceftazidime patients.\n\n**Cefoperazone/Sulbactam:** A controlled study showed similar mortality (around 18%) between cefoperazone/sulbactam and ceftazidime. Both treatments effectively managed severe melioidosis.\n\n**Ceftazidime + Co-trimoxazole:** Meta-analysis showed no significant difference in mortality between ceftazidime monotherapy and combination therapy with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.\n\n**Chloramphenicol vs. Doxycycline:** The conventional regimen of chloramphenicol and doxycycline outperformed doxycycline alone in maintaining melioidosis remission.\n\n**Co-amoxiclav vs. Conventional Therapy:** Co-amoxiclav was safer but had higher relapse rates (16% vs. 4%).
