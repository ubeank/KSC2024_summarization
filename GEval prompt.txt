You will be provided with a synthesized summary created from the abstracts of multiple research papers in the biomedical domain.

Your task is to rate the summary on three metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Faithfulness (1-5) - The summarizer does not manipulate the information in the input text (i.e.,intrinsic) and add any information not directly inferable from the input text (i.e., extrinsic).
Completeness(1-5) - The summarizer ensures the inclusion of all keyfacts from the input text in the output summary.
Conciseness(1-5) - The summarizer refrains from incorporating information outside the keyfacts in the output, maintaining a succinct and focused summary.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Read the original abstracts carefully and identify the main research objectives, methods, and key findings from the biomedical domain.
2. Read the synthesized summary and compare it to the original abstracts. Check if the summary:
(1). Accurately reflects the main objectives, methods, and findings.
(2). Clearly and logically integrates key points from multiple abstracts.
(3). Does not distort or omit important details.
3. Assign a score for each evaluation criterion (Faithfulness, Completeness, Conciseness) on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is the lowest and 5 is the highest, based on the provided evaluation criteria.
