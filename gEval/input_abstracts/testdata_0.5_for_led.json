        "Abstracts": "<s>In a group of 60 patients in the acute phase of an ischemic stroke the assumption that low-molecular-weight heparin Kabi 2165 in the dose of 2 X 2,500 anti-Xa units s.c. could prevent thromboembolic complications was tested using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial design. Both treatment groups were comparable with regard to neurological status and general condition. Cerebral bleeding complicated 2 cases in the placebo group versus 4 in the Kabi 2165 group (NS). Because of the small number of patients it is impossible to evaluate the safety.</s><s>Venous thrombo-embolism is a major and often unrecognized cause of morbidity and mortality in patients after acute strokes. A reduction in deep-vein thrombosis rate from 72.7% in the control group to 22.2% in treatment patients was achieved. In patients who died (84), post-mortem examination to look for pulmonary emboli was performed in 71. Comparison between treated and untreated patients showed significantly fewer deaths and pulmonary emboli in the treated group. When patients with pulmonary emboli at post-mortem were excluded, there was no significant difference in the death rate in treatment (17) and control (14) groups.</s><s>In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 225 patients with acute partial stable thrombotic stroke were randomly assigned to receive continuous intravenous heparin therapy or placebo for 7 days for the prevention of stroke progression or death. These deaths occurred 3 to 12 months after the initial stroke and probably were not related to treatment. Results of this study do not support the use of intravenous heparin to treat patients who have had acute partial stroke.</s><s>Anticoagulant therapy in cerebral infarction. Report on cooperative study.</s><s>Direct thrombin inhibitors, including argatroban, represent an anticoagulant class distinct from heparins. We investigated the safety of 2 levels of argatroban anticoagulation in acute ischemic stroke. The primary outcome was symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) at 30 days. Symptomatic ICH was not significantly different between groups (high-dose argatroban, 5.1%; low-dose argatroban, 3.4%; placebo, 0%; P> or =0.18), with 3 events during argatroban infusion and 2 events > or =7 days after stopping infusion. In this first North American randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of direct thrombin inhibition in acute ischemic stroke, argatroban at each dose evaluated significantly prolonged aPTTs without increasing ICH or major bleeding.</s><s>The effectiveness and safety of a very low molecular weight heparin fraction were evaluated in the prevention of deep-vein thrombosis in patients confined to bed due to hemiplegia consecutive to a recent cerebral infarction. One case of lethal pulmonary embolism was observed and confirmed at autopsy in the control group. Numerous standard laboratory tests confirmed that CY 222 was well tolerated.</s><s>Anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin is used commonly for treatment of acute ischemic stroke, but its use remains controversial because it has not been shown to be effective or safe. Between December 22, 1990, and December 6, 1997, 1281 persons with acute stroke were enrolled at 36 centers across the United States. At 3 months, 482 (75.2%) of 641 persons assigned to treatment with ORG 10172 and 467 (73.7%) of 634 patients treated with placebo had favorable outcomes (P=.49); 49.5% and 47%, respectively, of patients in each group had very favorable outcomes at 3 months. At 7 days, 376 (59.2%) of 635 persons given ORG 10172 and 344 (54.3%) of 633 receiving placebo had favorable outcomes (P=.07). Despite an apparent positive response to treatment at 7 days, emergent administration of the antithrombotic agent, ORG 10172, is not associated with an improvement in favorable outcome at 3 months.</s><s>Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and subsequent pulmonary embolism (PE) is a major source of mortality and morbidity in stroke patients. This study was designed to determine the effectiveness of different prophylactic treatments in the prevention of DVT after a stroke in patients undergoing rehabilitation. There was no significant difference in the development of DVT by treatment group. Patients with DVT on admission (prevalent, n = 61) were compared with the study patients (n = 360).</s><s>The effect of LMW heparin (Kabi 2165, Fragmin) was compared with placebo for the prevention of DVT in 103 patients with acute ischemic stroke using a prospective, double-blind, randomized trial design. All patients underwent thrombosis surveillance with unilateral venography of the paretic limb. The frequency of DVT was 15 of 42 patients or 36% (95% confidence interval 22 to 52%) in the LMW heparin group and 17 of 50 patients or 34% (21 to 49%) in the placebo group. The frequency of proximal thrombi was 5 of 42 (12%) and 8 of 50 (16%), respectively.</s><s>An open, randomized, controlled study including 57 patients with acute cerebral infarct was performed. The mesoglycan influenced only slightly the laboratory values (PT, PTT, alkaline phosphatase, GOT, GPT, cholesterol and triglycerides, fibrinogen, blood glucose, azotemia and creatinine) performed before the beginning of the treatment, as their changes after thirty days of therapy were in the normal range.</s><s>A trial of subcutaneous low-dose heparin in the prevention of deep-vein thrombosis was carried out in elderly patients admitted to hospital after an acute stroke.</s>"

        "Abstracts": "<s>Previous studies indicate that analysis of the ST waveform of the fetal electrocardiogram provides information on the fetal response to hypoxia. At three Swedish labour wards, 4966 women with term fetuses in the cephalic presentation entered the trial during labour after a clinical decision had been made to apply a fetal scalp electrode for internal cardiotocography. They were randomly assigned monitoring with cardiotocography plus ST analysis (CTG+ST group) or cardiotocography only (CTG group). The main outcome measure was rate of umbilical-artery metabolic acidosis (pH <7.05 and base deficit >12 mmol/L). Intrapartum monitoring with cardiotocography combined with automatic ST-waveform analysis increases the ability of obstetricians to identify fetal hypoxia and to intervene more appropriately, resulting in an improved perinatal outcome.</s><s>There is a need to improve the sensitivity and specificity of fetal monitoring during labour. We compared the gold standard, cardiotocography, with cardiotocography plus time-interval analysis of the fetal electrocardiogram in fetal surveillance. The aim was to find out whether time-interval analysis decreased the need for operative intervention due to fetal distress. We did a randomised, prospective trial in five hospitals in the UK, Hong Kong, the Netherlands, and Singapore. 1038 women undergoing high-risk labours were randomly assigned fetal monitoring by cardiotocography alone, or cardiotocography plus fetal electrocardiography (ECG).</s><s>To examine whether intrapartum monitoring by means of automatic ST analysis (STAN) of fetal electrocardiography could reduce the rate of neonatal acidemia and the rate of operative intervention during labour, compared with monitoring by means of cardiotocography (CTG). A total of 1483 women in active labour with singleton term fetus in cephalic presentation. Neonatal acidemia (umbilical artery pH <7.10), neonatal metabolic acidosis (umbilical artery pH <7.05 and base excess <-12 mmol/l) and operative interventions: caesarean section rate, vacuum outlet (VO) rate and FBS rate. The incidence of FBS was lower (P < 0.001) in the STAN group (7.0%) than in the CTG group (15.6%).</s><s>The physiology of changes in the ST waveform of the fetal electrocardiogram has been elucidated in extensive animal and human observational studies. Our purpose was to compare operative intervention and neonatal outcome in labors monitored by the conventional cardiotocogram with those monitored by ST waveform plus the cardiotocogram. There was a 46% reduction (p < 0.001, odds ratio 1.85 [1.35-2.66]) in operative deliveries for \"fetal distress\" and a trend to less metabolic acidosis (p = 0.09, odds ratio 0.38 [0.13-1.07]) and fewer low 5-minute Apgar scores (p = 0.12, odds ratio 0.62 [0.35-1.08]) in the ST waveform plus cardiotocogram arm. ST waveform analysis discriminates cardiotocogram changes in labor, and the protocol for interpretation is safe.</s><s>To estimate the effectiveness of intrapartum fetal monitoring by cardiotocography plus ST analysis using a strict protocol for performance of fetal blood sampling. Primary outcome was metabolic acidosis, defined as an umbilical cord artery pH below 7.05 combined with a base deficit calculated in the extracellular fluid compartment above 12 mmol/L. Secondary outcomes were metabolic acidosis in blood, operative deliveries, Apgar scores, neonatal admissions, and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. We randomly assigned 5,681 women to the two groups (2,832 index, 2,849 control). The fetal blood sampling rate was 10.6% in the index compared with 20.4% in the control group (relative risk 0.52; 95% [CI] 0.46-0.59). Using metabolic acidosis calculated in blood, these rates were 1.6% and 2.6%, respectively (relative risk 0.63; 95% CI 0.42-0.94; number needed to treat 100). Intrapartum monitoring by cardiotocography combined with ST analysis does not significantly reduce the incidence of metabolic acidosis calculated in the extracellular fluid compartment.</s>"

        "Abstracts": "<s>Cholesterol modification reduces cardiovascular events in patients with atherosclerosis, including those with peripheral arterial disease. This randomized, double-blind, parallel-design study included 354 persons with claudication attributable to peripheral arterial disease. Patients were treated with placebo, atorvastatin (10 mg per day), or atorvastatin (80 mg per day) for 12 months. Maximal walking time after 12 months of treatment with atorvastatin did not change significantly. A physical activity questionnaire demonstrated improvement in ambulatory ability for the 10- and 80-mg groups (P=0.011), whereas 2 quality of life instruments, the Walking Impairment Questionnaire and Short Form 36 Questionnaire, did not show significant change.</s><s>This study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of policosanol, a new cholesterol-lowering drug with concomitant antiplatelet effects, in patients with intermittent claudication. After a baseline period of 6 weeks, 62 patients were randomized to receive, under double-blind conditions, either placebo (31 patients) or policosanol (31), 10 mg twice daily. The reduction of lower limb symptoms showed a greater benefit in the policosanol group. There was no significant change in either group in the ankle/arm pressure ratio. Overall, 12/31 (38.7%) placebo patients and 3/31 (9.7%) policosanol patients experienced AEs after randomization, which showed a lesser incidence of AEs in the policosanol group (p<0.01).</s><s>The treatment of intermittent claudication with betapyridyl carbinol over two years.</s><s>This increase in viscosity, which is mainly due to elevated fibrinogen levels and a decreased red cell deformability, adversely influences blood flow. No significant changes in walking distances and pressure indices during rest and after exercise occurred, despite a significant increase in red cell deformability in the fish oil group. This suggests that red cell deformability is of minor importance in the arterial blood flow in the legs of these patients.</s><s>The effect of plasma lipid reduction on the progression of femoral atherosclerosis was studied in hyperlipidaemic patients with stable intermittent claudication. Biplanar arteriography was performed when the study began and after a mean period of 19 months. Angiograms were assessed visually, with blinding, and by computerised image analysis. Therapy reduced mean plasma total cholesterol by 25%, mean low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 28%, and mean plasma triglycerides by 45%. The mean increase in edge irregularity index (a measure of the severity of disease) in the treatment group was only 40% of that in the usual care group.</s><s>The Probucol Quantitative Regression Swedish Trial tested whether treatment of hypercholesterolemic persons with probucol for 3 years affected femoral atherosclerosis. Twenty-nine patients were excluded because of inadequate primary end point measurements. Seventeen percent had intermittent claudication and 24% had angina pectoris. After 3 years, the probucol-treated patients had 17% lower serum cholesterol, 12% lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 24% lower total high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and 34% lower high-density lipoprotein2 cholesterol levels than control subjects. Furthermore, there was no difference between the treatment groups with regard to change in arterial edge roughness or amount of aorto-femoral atherosclerosis; neither were there any differences between the treatment groups with regard to change in ST-segment depressions on exercise tests or ankle/arm blood pressure (secondary end points).</s><s>Effectiveness of short-term sulodexide treatment on peripheral vascular disease clinical manifestations.</s><s>To assess the effect of bezafibrate on the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke in men with lower extremity arterial disease. All coronary events, fatal and non-fatal coronary events separately, and strokes alone (secondary end points). There were 90 and 111 major coronary events in the active and placebo groups respectively (0.81, 0.60 to 1.08), of which 64 and 65 were fatal (0.95, 0.66 to 1.37) and 26 and 46 non-fatal (0.60, 0.36 to 0.99). Beneficial effects on non-fatal events were greatest in men aged <65 years at entry, in whom benefit was also seen for all coronary events (0.38, 0.20 to 0.72). There were 60 strokes in those on active treatment and 49 in those on placebo (1.34, 0.80 to 2.01). Bezafibrate reduced the severity of intermittent claudication for up to three years.</s><s>Thirty patients suffering from peripheral vascular disease (stage-II according to Fontaine) were included in a double-blind study aimed at assessing the efficacy of a high-dose glycosaminoglycan (GAG) (Sulodexide) both in terms of laboratory parameters, such as lipid metabolism and blood coagulation components, and instrumental procedures (strain-gauge plethysmography).</s><s>Patients with peripheral arterial obstructive disease require treatment to prevent major cardiovascular events and to relieve intermittent claudication. A randomized, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed in 286 patients with Leriche-Fontaine stage II peripheral arterial obstructive disease. The pain-free walking distance increased on average (+/-SE) by 83.2+/-8.6 m (+64.7% from baseline) with sulodexide and 36.7+/-6.2 m (+29.9% from baseline) with placebo (P=0.001). Results for patients with type II diabetes were similar to those for non-diabetic patients. Sulodexide improved the walking ability of peripheral arterial obstructive disease patients to a significantly greater extent than placebo, with a concurrent significant decrease in fibrinogen.</s><s>To analyze the effects of short-term therapy with simvastatin on walking performance in hypercholesterolemic patients with peripheral vascular disease. Eighty-six patients with peripheral arterial disease (Fontaine stage II), intermittent claudication, and total cholesterol levels >220 mg/dL were enrolled in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. Forty-three patients were assigned to simvastatin (40 mg/d); the remaining 43 patients were assigned to placebo treatment. Pain-free and total walking distance, resting and postexercise ankle-brachial indexes, and questionnaire scores were determined at each follow-up. At 6 months, the mean pain-free walking distance had increased 90 meters (95% confidence interval [CI]: 64 to 116 meters; P <0.005) more in the simvastatin group than in the placebo group.</s><s>Policosanol is a cholesterol-lowering drug with concomitant antiplatelet effects. The study had a 4-week baseline step, followed by a 20-week double blinded, randomized treatment period. Compared with baseline, policosanol increased significantly (p < 0.01) the initial claudication distance (ICD) from 160.39 +/- 15.82 m to 211.31 +/- 21.48 m (+33.7%) and the absolute claudication distance (ACD) (p < 0.001) from 236.39 +/- 25.44 m to 288.09 +/- 28.47 m (+24.3%); meanwhile both variables remained unchanged after lovastatin therapy. Changes in ICD and ACD were significantly larger in the policosanol than in the lovastatin group (p < 0.01). Lovastatin reduced (p < 0.01) TC (18.0%), LDL-C (22.6%), and (p < 0.05) triglycerides (9.8%). Only 1 lovastatin patient withdrew from the study because of a nonfatal myocardial infarction. Five lovastatin patients, but none from the policosanol group, experienced 6 adverse events (AE) (p < 0.01). The present results indicate that policosanol, but not lovastatin, is a suitable alternative to manage patients with intermittent claudication because of pleiotropic properties beyond its cholesterol-lowering effects.</s><s>Policosanol is a cholesterol-lowering drug with concomitant antiplatelet effects. The study consisted of a 6-week single-blind, placebo-controlled run in phase, followed by a 2-year double-blind, randomized treatment step. Walking distances on a treadmill (constant speed 3.2 km/h, slope 10 degrees, temperature 25 degrees C) were assessed before and after 6, 12, 18, and 24 months of treatment. After 6 months of therapy, policosanol significantly increased (p < 0.01) the initial claudication distance from 125.9 +/- 8.7 m to 201.1 +/- 24.8 m and the absolute claudication distance from 219.5 +/- 14.1 m to 380.7 +/- 50.2 m. Both variables remained unchanged in the placebo group (p < 0.01). In addition, from month 6 up to study completion, the frequency of patients reporting improvement of lower limb symptoms was greater in the policosanol group than in the placebo group. The present results demonstrate the long-term usefulness of policosanol therapy to treat patients with intermittent claudication.</s>"

        "Abstracts": "<s>The purpose of this study was to evaluate three ventilator weaning strategies and to evaluate whether the use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) via a nasopharyngeal or endotracheal tube would increase the likelihood of extubation failure in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. We studied prospectively 87 preterm infants (mean +/- SD; birth weight: 1078 +/- 188 g; gestational age: 28.8 +/- 2.2 weeks) who were in the process of being weaned from intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV). Infants were assigned by systematic sampling to one of the following three treatment groups: (1) direct extubation from IMV (D.EXT) (n = 30); (2) preextubation endotracheal CPAP (ET-CPAP) for 12-24 hr (n = 28); or (3) postextubation nasopharyngeal CPAP (NP-CPAP) for 12-24 hr (n = 29). There were no significant differences in failure rates among the three procedures. There were also no differences in FiO2, PaO2, and respiratory rates before and after discontinuation of IMV among the three groups.</s><s>Sixty infants (median gestational age 29 weeks) with acute and 60 infants (median gestational age 25 weeks) with chronic respiratory distress were randomised to be extubated either directly into a headbox or onto 3 cm H2O nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Our aim was to test the hypothesis that extubation onto nasal CPAP rather than directly into a headbox was more likely to be associated with successful extubation in infants with acute rather than chronic respiratory distress.</s><s>We conducted a prospective, randomized controlled trial to determine whether extubation of very low birth weight infants was facilitated by the use of nasopharyngeal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Eligible infants included patients weighing 600 to 1500 gm at birth who required tracheal intubation within 48 hours of birth and who met specific predetermined criteria for extubation by day 14 of life. Extubation failure was predefined as a requirement for > or = 80% oxygen, pH < or = 7.20, severe apnea, or predefined clinical deterioration, and extubation success was predefined as the ability to remain free of a requirement for mechanical ventilation for 7 days and a 66% reduction in the need for supplemental oxygen.</s><s>A prospective randomized trial was performed in 58 neonates comparing nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) vs oxyhood following extubation of neonates weighing less than 1 kg. Clinical criteria for elective extubation included improving pulmonary status, fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) less than or equal to 0.35, mean airway pressure less than or equal to 7 cm H2O, ventilator rate less than or equal to 20 breaths per minute, and weight at least 80% of birth weight. Informed consent was obtained and neonates were randomized to NCPAP or oxyhood following extubation. Success was defined as remaining free of additional ventilatory support for at least 5 days. There were no differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups. Of the 23 neonates who failed oxyhood, 21 were then given a trial of NCPAP and 58% (12/21) remained extubated.</s><s>Using a preset protocol for early extubation, 50 babies were randomly selected to post-extubation headbox or post-extubation nasal continuous positive airway pressure (N-CPAP). The criteria for extubation included stable condition, fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) of < or = 35%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of < or = 15 cm H2O (1.47 kPa), and ventilator rate of 6/minute. Before extubation, a loading dose of aminophylline was given followed by maintenance treatment. If reintubation was not required within 72 hours of the initial extubation the procedure was considered successful. There were no significant differences in clinical characteristics between the two groups. The most common cause of failure in early extubation was apnoea, and most occurred in the headbox group (9/12).</s><s>A prospective randomized controlled trial was performed comparing the use of a short period (24 hr) of postextubation nasal continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) with direct extubation into headbox oxygen on the outcome of the need for reintubation within 7 days of initial extubation. Ninety-seven babies were entered into the study (48 CPAP and 49 headbox oxygen). Twenty-four (49%) babies in the headbox group were reventilated within a week, compared to 16 (33%) in the CPAP group (P=0.17). By 14 days after initial extubation, 25 babies (51%) in the headbox group and 23 (48%) in the CPAP group required reventilation (P=0.9). In conclusion, this study showed that a short period of nasal CPAP is not associated with a reduction in reventilation.</s><s>Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (N-CPAP), applied immediately after extubation, was prospectively evaluated in 18 neonates recovering from respiratory distress syndrome. This was associated with considerably better clinical courses in group 1 when compared with group 2, in which six patients required a late trial of N-CPAP because of respiratory deterioration and two patients needed reintubation.</s><s>The aim of this study was to determine whether elective use of nasal continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) following extubation of preterm infants was well tolerated and improved short- and long-term outcomes. A total of 150 infants (median gestational age 30 weeks, range 24-34 weeks) were randomized in two centres. Overall, nasal CPAP significantly reduced the need for increased respiratory support (relative risk, 0.57, 95% CI 0.43-0.73), but not for re-intubation (relative risk 0.89, 95% CI 0.68-1.17). Nasal CPAP neither influenced significantly the intraventricular haemorrhage rate reported in four studies (relative risk 1.0, 95% CI 0.55, 1.82) nor that of oxygen dependency at 28 days reported in six studies (relative risk 1.0, 95% CI 0.8, 1.25).</s><s>To determine whether extubation to nasal continuous airway pressure (NCPAP) results in a greater proportion of infants remaining free of additional ventilatory support for one week after extubation compared with those extubated directly to headbox oxygen. A randomised, controlled, clinical trial was conducted at the neonatal intensive care unit of the Royal Women's Hospital, Melbourne, of infants with birthweights between 600 and 1250 g, ventilated via an endotracheal tube for more than 12 hours, requiring less than 50% oxygen, a ventilator rate < or = 20/minute, considered by the clinical management team to be ready for extubation. Infants were randomly allocated either to NCPAP or to oxygen administered via a headbox. Success was defined by no requirement for additional ventilatory support over the week following extubation. There was no significant difference between the groups in the total number of days of assisted ventilation or the duration of inpatient stay. NCPAP applied prophylactically after endotracheal extubation reduces the incidence of adverse clinical events that lead to failure of extubation in the seven days after extubation.</s>"

The inhaler is clearly useful for short-term smoking cessation with potential for long-term efficacy. Extended access to the inhaler and relapse prevention training could improve success rates. Another promising approach would be to combine the inhaler with a nicotine patch.</s><s>Laboratory trials have demonstrated the efficacy of nicotine replacement in smoking cessation but absolute success rates are low. For many, nicotine gum is hard to use and transdermal nicotine is slow-acting and passive. A new, faster-acting nicotine nasal spray (NNS) can provide easily self-administered relief from cigarette withdrawal. Two hundred and fifty-five smokers were randomized to NNS or a piperine placebo. Subjects were tested while smoking and at post-cessation daily (week 1) with follow-up at weeks 2, 3, 6 and at 3 months, 6 months and 1 year. Cotinine measures showed that replacement of nicotine approximated 30% of smoking levels.</s><s>In a double blind randomised trial to aid smoking cessation a 2 mg nicotine gum (n = 101) was compared with a 4 mg gum (n = 98), in smokers of at least 15 cigarettes/day. The trial involved blue and white collar workers and took place at their working place (industrial setting). However in a sub-group with a higher nicotine-dependence score, only 18.5% were abstainers at one year in the 2 mg nicotine gum group against 32.9% in the 4 mg nicotine gum, which is a significant difference at the p = 0.05 level.</s><s>[Treatment of smoking: efficacy of the use of nicotine chewing gum. Double-blind study].</s><s>To assess the smoking prevalence and efficacy of nicotine replacement therapy on the quitting rate after 3 weeks of therapy and after 1- and 5-year follow-up among health care workers with a smoking habit in Split, Croatia. Among 311 hospital health professionals included in the study, there were 112 (36%) smokers; 44 (39%) of them were physicians and 68 (61%) nurses. Abstinence was evaluated via questionnaire and on the basis of carbon monoxide concentration measured in the exhaled breath. The abstinence rates after the 3-week intervention period were 39% in the TNS group and almost 20% in the control group (chi-square test, p=0.038).</s><s>There are a lot of methods for smoking cessation but transdermal nicotine system (TNS) is one of the most popular. On a sample of more than 300 smokers we have formerly shown that TNS achieves higher abstinence rate than placebo (38%:21%). 160 smokers were subdivided in 4 groups of 40, receiving either TNS or placebo, for 3 or 6 weeks. The abstinence rate was evaluated by appropriate questionnaires and measuring CO in the exhaled air.</s><s>To determine the effectiveness of 2 weeks' pre-cessation nicotine patches and/or gum on smoking abstinence at 6 months. However, when pooled in a meta-analysis with other pre-cessation trials a moderate benefit of about a one-quarter increase in cessation rates was evident. In this, the largest pre-cessation NRT trial to date, using NRT 2 weeks before the target quit day was safe and well tolerated but offered no benefit over usual care. However, in conjunction with previous pre-cessation trials there appears to be a moderate benefit, but not as large as that seen in most smaller trials.</s><s>This multicenter, randomized, open-label clinical trial was conducted to determine whether the combined use of nicotine patch therapy and a nicotine nasal spray would improve smoking abstinence rates compared to either treatment alone, without behavioral counseling. Data were collected at 15 regional cancer control oncology centers within the North Central Cancer Treatment Group. Of the 1384 smokers randomized to the study, 20% were abstinent from smoking at 6 weeks and 8% were abstinent at 6 months. At 6 weeks, the 7-day point prevalence smoking abstinence rate for the patch alone (21.1%) was superior to the spray (13.6%) but was significantly lower than the rate for combination therapy (27.1%).</s><s>To compare the efficacy and safety of 22-mg and 44-mg doses of transdermal nicotine therapy when it is paired with minimal, individual, or group counseling to improve smoking cessation rates. An 8-week clinical trial (4 weeks double-blind followed by 4 weeks open label) using random assignment of participants to both dose (22 or 44 mg) and counseling (minimal, individual, or group) conditions. Daily cigarette smokers (> or = 15 cigarettes per day for at least 1 year) who volunteered to participate in a study of smoking cessation treatment. Four weeks of 22- or 44-mg transdermal nicotine therapy followed by 4 weeks of dosage reduction (2 weeks of 22 mg followed by 2 weeks of 11 mg). All participants returned weekly to turn in questionnaires and for assessment of their smoking status. Abstinence from smoking was based on self-report, confirmed by an expired carbon monoxide concentration lower than 10 ppm. Withdrawal severity was assessed by means of an eight-item self-report questionnaire completed daily. Transdermal nicotine therapy at doses of 44 mg produced a significantly greater frequency of nausea (28%), vomiting (10%), and erythema with edema at the patch site (30%) than did a 22-mg dose (10%, 2%, and 13%, respectively; P < .01 for each adverse effect). There does not appear to be any general, sustained benefit of initiating transdermal nicotine therapy with a 44-mg patch dose or of providing intense adjuvant smoking cessation treatment.</s><s>The results are reported from a multicentered, randomized clinical trial of a physician-delivered smoking cessation intervention package. All physicians attended a four-hour training session during which the rationales for the different aspects of the intervention were discussed, including a detailed description of the proper use of nicotine-bearing chewing gum. Receptionists were instructed to recruit the first two smokers attending the practice each day. The 95 percent confidence interval about this difference was -9.3 percent to 6.4 percent. There is no evidence from this study that the offer of 2 mg of nicotine-bearing gum enhances smoking cessation rates when added to a comprehensive intervention offered to all smokers in primary care.</s><s>To assess the smoking cessation efficacy of transdermal nicotine patches as an adjunct to low-intervention therapy, we conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 158 smokers. The impact of the three regimens on smoking cessation rates and tobacco withdrawal symptoms was examined. During the last 2 weeks of the trial, 39% of the 24-hour nicotine regimen delivery group, 35% of those on wakeful hour nicotine regimens, and 13.5% of the placebo treatment group achieved abstinence. Moreover, compared with placebo, the transdermal nicotine patches significantly reduced tobacco withdrawal symptoms during the first few weeks of quitting. The differences in quit rates and tobacco withdrawal symptoms between the two active groups were not statistically significant.</s><s>Use of nicotine-replacement therapies and the antidepressant bupropion helps people stop smoking. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled comparison of sustained-release bupropion (244 subjects), a nicotine patch (244 subjects), bupropion and a nicotine patch (245 subjects), and placebo (160 subjects) for smoking cessation. Weight gain at seven weeks was significantly less in the combined-treatment group than in the bupropion group and the placebo group (P<0.05 for both comparisons). Seventy-nine subjects stopped treatment because of adverse events: 6 in the placebo group (3.8 percent), 16 in the nicotine-patch group (6.6 percent), 29 in the bupropion group (11.9 percent), and 28 in the combined-treatment group (11.4 percent). Abstinence rates were higher with combination therapy than with bupropion alone, but the difference was not statistically significant.</s><s>Nicotine-containing chewing gum as an anti-smoking aid.</s><s>To evaluate the smoking cessation efficacy of nicotine patch therapy as an adjunct to low-intensity, primary care intervention. Two brief primary care visits for smoking intervention with 10 weeks of active or placebo-patch therapy. Among those with high nicotine dependency scores (Fagerstrom score > or = 7), 1-year abstinence rates were significantly higher in the nicotine patch group (19.1%) compared with the placebo group (5.0%) (chi 2 = 10.7; P = .001). Nicotine patch therapy enhanced 6 month quit rates as an adjunct to brief primary care intervention. Duration of counseling, patient age, and Fagerstrom scores may be important factors related to the long-term smoking cessation success of nicotine patch therapy.</s><s>Despite the well-documented efficacy and different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of different forms of nicotine replacement therapy, empirical data are insufficient to guide practitioners in selecting a particular form of treatment for individual patients with tobacco dependence. 299 treatment-seeking smokers who were followed for 6 months after the target quit date. Behavioral group counseling and 8 weeks of therapy with nicotine nasal spray or transdermal nicotine. Demographic characteristics, smoking history, depression symptoms, and body mass index were measured at baseline. The subgroup findings need confirmation in additional large studies before they are routinely applied.</s><s>Three hundred fifteen smokers who attended a family practice clinic and wished to quit smoking were assigned in a random, double-blind manner to receive either nicotine (2 mg) or placebo gum. Smokers initially received brief advice from a physician and nurse, a slide presentation and written materials (29 to 35 minutes), and a single follow-up visit (12 to 20 minutes) one week after cessation. After corrections for marital status and income, 10% of those who received nicotine gum and 7% of those who received placebo gum reported continuous abstinence for 11 months and passed observer and biochemical verification (this difference was not statistically significant).</s><s>To assess efficacy and tolerance of a transdermal nicotine system (TNS) as adjuvant to tobacco withdrawal, 112 young, nicotine-dependent cigarette smokers were treated for nine weeks with TNS (n = 56) or placebo (n = 56). The craving for cigarettes diminished steadily, but not more significantly on TNS medication. Tenseness, difficulty in concentration and feelings of hunger were consistently and in part significantly lessened in the TNS group. Other mild, transient, systemic side effects reported by 33.9% of the TNS and 26.8% of the placebo users (n. s.) did not lead to drop-outs.</s><s>Nicotine replacement therapies are efficacious for treating nicotine dependence. However, limited data exist on benefits of different NRTs and predictors of treatment outcome. This study compared the effectiveness of transdermal nicotine vs. nicotine lozenge for smoking cessation and identified predictors of treatment response. A logistic regression model of 6-month quit rates showed smokers who preferred transdermal nicotine had higher quit rates on transdermal nicotine, and smokers who used nicotine to alleviate distress or stimulate cognitive processes had lower quit rates on nicotine lozenge. Transdermal nicotine may be more effective than nicotine lozenge for smokers who prefer transdermal nicotine and do not smoke to alleviate emotional distress or stimulate cognitive function.</s><s>One hundred six smokers seen in a family practice received brief physician advice and a prescription for nicotine gum. Smokers were randomly assigned to pay $20, $6, or $0/box of nicotine gum and followed for 6 months. Decreased cost increased the incidence of obtaining gum, the amount of gum used, and the incidence of long-term use (P less than 0.05).</s><s>Tobacco dependence is a chronic, relapsing condition that may require extended treatment. Parallel randomized, placebo-controlled trial from September 2004 to February 2008. Participants and all research personnel except the database manager were blinded to randomization. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00364156)\n                Academic center. The primary outcome was biochemically confirmed point-prevalence abstinence at weeks 24 and 52. Extended therapy reduced the risk for lapse (hazard ratio, 0.77 [CI, 0.63 to 0.95]; P = 0.013) and increased the chances of recovery from lapses (hazard ratio, 1.47 [CI, 1.17 to 1.84]; P = 0.001). Time to relapse was slower with extended versus standard therapy (hazard ratio, 0.50 [CI, 0.35 to 0.73]; P < 0.001). Transdermal nicotine for 24 weeks increased biochemically confirmed point-prevalence abstinence and continuous abstinence at week 24, reduced the risk for smoking lapses, and increased the likelihood of recovery to abstinence after a lapse compared with 8 weeks of transdermal nicotine therapy.</s><s>Smoking is a major public health issue, estimated as causing 120 000 deaths in the UK per year. There were no significant demographic differences between the two groups at baseline. One hundred and ten patients gave up smoking for at least 1 week, 54% AS+NRT and 33% AS (p<0.001). In hospital patients NRT, given as regular daily patches plus an inhalator to be used as needed, did not add to the smoking cessation rate achieved at 1 year by regular advice and support, despite significantly increasing the cessation rate at 1 week.</s><s>With smoking prevalence rates beginning to decline, studies designed to promote cessation in more challenging populations, like weight-concerned smokers, warrant attention. This study assessed the efficacy of two forms of pharmacotherapy [nicotine and phenylpropanolamine (PPA) gums] in addition to a 13-week cognitive behavioral smoking cessation program targeted for women. All participants attended a 13-week cognitive behavioral smoking cessation program and were given specific instructions on gum chewing. Results indicated that neither change in body weight nor cessation rates significantly differed between groups. These results suggest that although the pharmacological interventions had no effect on cessation rates and postcessation weight gain, the behavioral component of the intervention was effective in increasing the odds of quitting smoking in weight-concerned women. Future efforts should focus on increasing adherence to behavioral program components, particularly session attendance.</s><s>Nicotine replacement therapy is an effective treatment for nicotine-dependent smokers. However, cessation rates are modest, and preliminary studies suggest that combination therapy may be superior. Group 2 (n = 200) received the nicotine inhaler plus placebo patch for 12 weeks, then inhaler for 14 weeks. Inhaler was used at a rate of 6 to 12 cartridges per day ad libitum for 3 months and then tapered off. Main outcome measures were complete abstinence (self-reported) and expired carbon dioxide concentration less than 10 ppm. Group 1 vs group 2 complete abstinence rates were 60.5% and 47.5% at 6 weeks (P =.009), 42.0% and 31.0% at 12 weeks (P =.02), 25.0% and 22.5% at 6 months (P =.56), and 19.5% and 14.0% at 12 months (P =. The most common adverse events were throat irritation (inhaler) and itching (patch).</s><s>In an additive design, test the efficacy of cue exposure treatment for smoking relapse prevention as an adjunct to current standard cognitive behavioral and pharmacological treatments. One hundred and twenty-nine cigarette smokers recruited through newspaper advertisements. There were no significant differences between conditions in point-prevalence abstinence rates or in time to first slip.</s><s>The rate of smoking was significantly reduced in volunteer subjects by providing effective nicotine replacement, self-help material, and weekly visits with a nurse for 6 weeks. Nicotine-replacement therapy with a transdermal nicotine patch (Nicolan) almost doubled the 6-week smoking-cessation rate in comparison with that in a placebo group (77% versus 39%; P = 0.002) among subjects who were smoking at least 20 cigarettes per day at baseline. Although most subjects who used the active nicotine patches had skin reactions, the reactions were primarily mild.</s><s>To determine the efficacy of a 22-mg nicotine patch combined with the National Cancer Institute program for physician advice and nurse follow-up in providing withdrawal symptom relief, 1-year smoking cessation outcome, and percentage of nicotine replacement. Two-hundred forty healthy volunteers who were smoking at least 20 cigarettes per day. Based on the National Cancer Institute program, subjects received smoking cessation advice from a physician. Follow-up and relapse prevention were provided by a study nurse during individual counseling sessions. Higher smoking cessation rates were also observed in subjects assigned to the active patch who had lower serum levels of nicotine and cotinine at baseline, and withdrawal symptom relief was better in the active patch group compared with placebo. Clinically significant smoking cessation can be achieved using nicotine patch therapy combined with physician intervention, nurse counseling, follow-up, and relapse prevention.</s><s>This study investigated the effect of matching smokers to nicotine replacement therapy (nicotine gum) on the basis of the pretreatment level of nicotine dependence. All smokers participated concurrently in a 5-week treatment program consisting of four brief counseling sessions combined with a self-help manual provided by the American Lung Association. The relative differences in outcomes persisted after 1 year of follow-up, but the high overall rate of relapse (92.5%) rendered the absolute size of the differences statistically insignificant.</s><s>To evaluate the efficacy of the transdermal nicotine patch as an aid to smoking cessation when used as an adjunct to a cognitive-behavioural group intervention and to assess the effectiveness of the patch in ameliorating withdrawal symptoms. Double-blind placebo-controlled randomised trial with six months' follow-up of those who returned to the hospital-based outpatients smoking cessation clinic. Mean age was 42 years, 48% were male, mean cigarette consumption was 29 per day and mean duration of smoking was 24 years. We examined the effectiveness of the nicotine patch in ameliorating specific withdrawal symptoms by self-report of degree of severity. The active nicotine patch resulted in significantly higher biochemically confirmed abstinence rates when compared with placebo at three months (48% v. 21%) and at six months (33% v. 14%). The most common adverse events among active patch users were sleep disturbance and local skin irritation.</s><s>Three smoking cessation interventions designed for use by general practitioners (GPs) within the routine consultation were evaluated in a field setting using 26 GPs throughout metropolitan Sydney. Although significant differences in the percentage of abstainers were observed between Groups SBCN and SBC three weeks after treatment (39% vs. 26%), the point prevalence abstinence rate for patients at 12 months declined to 19, 18, and 12% for Groups SBCN, SBC, and AN, respectively. Forty-eight percent of the 450 patients made an attempt to stop smoking, and 89% reduced their cigarette consumption at some point during the study. Examination of 132 self-selecting patients who fully participated in the three interventions and attended all scheduled visits, revealed significantly larger proportions of abstainers within Groups SBCN (34%) and SBC (33%) than in Group AN (15%) at the 12-month follow-up.</s><s>Guidelines recommend that smoking cessation interventions are offered in all clinical settings to all smokers willing to make a quit attempt. Since the effectiveness of routine provision of behavioural counselling and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) to smokers admitted to hospital has not been established, a randomised controlled trial of these interventions given together compared with counselling alone or minimal intervention was performed in hospital inpatients. Abstinence was higher in the NRT plus counselling group (n=91) than in the counselling alone (n=91) or usual care (n=92) groups. The difference between the groups was significant for validated point prevalence abstinence at discharge (55%, 43%, 37% respectively, p=0.045) and at 12 months (17%, 6%, 8%, p=0.03). There was no significant difference between counselling alone and usual care, or in reduction in cigarette consumption between the treatment groups.</s><s>Smoking cessation is an arduous process because nicotine withdrawal syndrome, which occurs following sudden interruption of nicotine use in long-term smokers, frequently prevents them from giving up the habit. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effectiveness and safety of a 30-mg transdermal nicotine patch in a smoking cessation program for Chinese smokers. Nineteen (63%, 95% confidence interval, CI, 46%-80%) of the smokers treated with the transdermal nicotine patch had successfully quit smoking at the end of the program (6 weeks) and nine (30%, 95% CI 14%-46%) remained abstinent 1 year later. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups of smokers after 1 year of follow-up (p = 0.08). Side-effects were minimal and did not affect the efficacy of the skin patch.</s><s>Medical advice and use of nicotine gum have recently received increased attention as effective tools to encourage smokers to quit, yet the relative value of nurse vs physician counseling has not been explored in depth. Three hundred forty-nine patients (82%) could be reached by telephone at the two-month follow up. By that time, after correcting for the estimated validity of the phone report of smoking status, the proportion declaring themselves to be nonsmokers was 10.9%, 11.1%, and 10.8%, respectively, without significant differences between them. The present study shows no difference between physician versus nurse counseling and no improvement in the proportion of quitters with the addition of nicotine gum in the physician-counseled group.</s><s>The results after 6 months of the treatment of three intervention groups with nicotine chewing gum to evaluate its effectiveness for the treatment of smoking addiction in primary care are reported. After random allocation, 106 individuals out of the 200 recruited in three health centers started the treatment. The active group (n = 37), treated with group sessions and nicotine chewing gum, was compared with a placebo group (n = 38) with an identical intervention. The success rate was 35.1 in the first group and 13.2 in the second (p less than 0.03), thus confirming the effectiveness of nicotine chewing gum.</s><s>Weight gain after smoking cessation is often cited by women smokers as a primary reason for not attempting to quit smoking or for relapsing after a cessation attempt. Weight and smoking status were measured at the end of treatment and at 6 and 12 months posttreatment. Weight gain did not vary by treatment condition, so its effect on relapse could not be examined by group. The added behavioral weight control program was attractive to the participants and did not reduce smoking cessation rates.</s><s>The effects of nicotine (NI), silver acetate (SA), and ordinary (PL) chewing gum on the cessation of smoking were compared through ratings on six smoking types and physiological nicotine dependence (F-score) in a placebo-controlled and randomized study that included 496 smokers in a group-support setting. The effect of NI was superior to SA in smokers with high type 1 ratings, the effects of NI and SA were almost equal and superior to PL in smokers with high type 4 and 6 ratings, and the effect was independent of the F-score.</s><s>The objective of the study was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of nicotine nasal solution (NNS) for smoking cessation from the stopping day up to 3 months. We also followed the participants for 2 yrs after ceasing smoking to assess what happens after stopping using NNS. In a placebo-controlled, double-blind, 2 yr prospective study, 157 smokers were given either NNS, one dose containing 1 mg of nicotine per 100 microL (n=79), or placebo (n=78). After 3 months, 65% of the abstainers in the nicotine group were still using the NNS. The proportion abstinent at the 1 yr (25 vs 17%) and 2 yr follow-ups (19 vs 14%) was higher among those assigned to the nicotine than to the placebo group, but not significantly so for the numbers used in the study.</s><s>To evaluate the efficacy of using a nicotine patch for 5 months with a nicotine nasal spray for 1 year. Nicotine patch for 5 months with nicotine nasal spray for 1 year (n=118) or nicotine patch with placebo spray (n=119). Sustained abstinence rates for the patch and nasal spray group and patch only group were 51% v 35% after 6 weeks (odds ratio 1.97, 95% confidence interval 1.17% to 3.32; P=0.011(chi2), 37% v 25% after 3 months (1.76, 1.01 to 3.08; P=0.045), 31% v 16% after 6 months (2.40, 1.27 to 4.50; P=0.005), 27% v 11% after 12 months (3.03, 1.50 to 6.14; P=0.001), and 16% v 9% after 6 years (2.09, 0.93 to 4.72; P=0.08) [corrected]. Short and long term abstinence rates show that the combination of using a nicotine patch for 5 months with a nicotine nasal spray for 1 year is a more effective method of stopping smoking than using a patch only.</s><s>Sixty subjects were run in a study comparing the use of nicotine gum with placebo gum during cessation from smoking. A survival analysis showed the two groups differed significantly in successful abstinence over time (p less than .03). Differences between groups appeared early (within weeks) and, at six months, a 28% superiority of nicotine over placebo gum was demonstrated with mean success rates of 48% and 20%, respectively. Long-term cessation may require extended maintenance procedures and/or an identification of optimal gum use.</s><s>The primary aim was to compare the efficacy of smoking cessation treatment using a combination of active nicotine patch plus active nicotine gum versus therapy consisting of active nicotine patch plus placebo gum in a sample of alcohol-dependent tobacco smokers in an early phase of out-patient alcohol treatment. Participants were 96 men and women with a diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and smoking 15 or more cigarettes per day. All participants received open-label transdermal nicotine patches and were randomized to receive either 2 mg nicotine gum or placebo gum under double-blind conditions. Analysis of 1-year follow-up data revealed that patients receiving nicotine patch plus active gum had better smoking outcomes than those receiving patch plus placebo gum on measures of time to smoking relapse and prolonged abstinence at 12 months. Alcohol outcomes were not significantly different across medication conditions.</s><s>The effect of different follow-up programs reinforced or not reinforced with the nicotine chewing gum Nicorette was tested by 13 physicians working in the open health care system. A total of 151 patients were advised to stop smoking, and were asked to participate in the program if judged sufficiently motivated by the physicians. The results at 12 months were that long follow-up showed a trend (P less than 0.12 toward being better than short follow-up, while nicotine gum was significantly better than no gum (P less than 0.05) in maintaining abstinence. The abstinence outcomes at 12 months for the other groups were short follow-up and nicotine gum, 22%; long follow-up and no gum, 15%; and short follow-up and no gum, 3%. The physicians' reactions to the smoking cessation treatment were largely positive.</s><s>Two hundred smokers who were judged by their general practitioner to be motivated to stop smoking were allocated to one of two groups. At one year follow up 15.5% overall had stopped smoking, 14% in the low and 17% in the high contact group.</s><s>A nicotine mouth spray has advantages over other acute forms of nicotine replacement therapy, such as a faster uptake of nicotine and faster relief of craving. Active treatment yielded significantly higher continuous abstinence rates than placebo from week 2 until week 6 (26.1% versus 16.1%; relative success rate (RR) 1.62, 95% CI 1.09-2.41), week 24 (15.7% versus 6.8%; RR 2.30, 95% CI 1.23-4.30), and week 52 (13.8% versus 5.6%; RR 2.48, 95% CI 1.24-4.94). Most adverse events were mild to moderate, and 9.1% of subjects on active spray withdrew due to adverse events, compared to 7.5% on placebo.</s><s>A double-blind trial of a smoking-withdrawal chewing gum containing 2 mg nicotine was conducted with 100 consecutive patients in a smoking cessation clinic. All patients received the usual psychological treatment given at the clinic. The differences were significant at the 5% level at all three follow-up periods. When nicotine dependence, as measured by a standard questionnaire, was taken into consideration, it was found that 71% of the high-nicotine-dependent smokers in the experimental group were abstinent after 6 months, as compared to 39% in the placebo group.</s><s>Nicotine replacement by transdermal patches is more effective than placebo in smoking cessation, but has a low success rate after one year (9-18%). Smokers with high baseline cotinine had lower success rates, and a high dose of nicotine did not increase success rate (HC-25 9% vs HC-15 11%). Subjects in the HC-15 group had the lowest percentage of nicotine replacement and a higher prevalence of withdrawal symptoms than the HC-25 group. Replacement was similar in groups LC-15 and HC-25, but the success rate was significantly lower in HC-25 group, despite similar levels of withdrawal symptoms. We conclude that a higher success rate was obtained after one year in smokers with low baseline plasma cotinine values.</s><s>A study with a 2 x 2 factorial design was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture, of nicotine gum and the effect of the association on smoking cessation.</s><s>To assess the effect of nicotine patches on continine-validated smoking cessation in pregnant women and the effect of nicotine on birth weight and preterm delivery. Women randomized to nicotine were treated with 15-mg patches (16 hours/day) for 8 weeks, and 10-mg patches (16 hours/day) for 3 weeks. At the end of the intervention, the mean value of cotinine in saliva in women assigned to nicotine was 120 ng/mL and placebo 153 ng/mL (mean difference -33; 95% CI -72, 6 ng/mL). Mean birth weight difference was 186 g (95% CI 35, 336 g) higher in the nicotine than placebo group, and there was an insignificantly lower rate of low birth weight (under 2500 g) in the former group.</s><s>Eighty-nine smokers were randomly assigned to four nicotine gum treatments for smoking cessation: behavioral treatment plus a fixed schedule of nicotine gum, behavioral treatment plus an ad lib schedule, education plus a fixed schedule, and education plus an ad lib schedule. However, at 6-month follow-up, the subjects who had received behavioral treatment had a significantly better abstinence rate (36.7%) than those receiving education (17.5%).</s><s>Smoking cessation is a key intervention for prevention of several lung diseases. A total of 446 smokers (>9 cigarettes x day(-1)) were allocated to a nurse-conducted smoking cessation programme with 4 treatment arms: a 5-mg nicotine patch (\"placebo\"), a 15-mg nicotine patch, nicotine inhaler, and a 15-mg nicotine patch plus nicotine inhaler. Individual follow-up studies were scheduled after 2 and 6 weeks, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. To conclude, the set-up investigated in this study which included minimal behavioural support with nicotine patches should be evaluated in other lung clinics, as it doubled success rate when compared to a placebo with a 1-yr point prevalence of 16% and also the resources used are limited.</s><s>To determine the efficacy of the transdermal nicotine patch for smoking cessation in inner-city African Americans. A computer-generated random numbers table with a block size set at 20 was used to randomize 410 patients to one of two study arms. The transdermal nicotine patch for 10 weeks as an adjunct to brief counseling. At 6 months, quit rates were 17.1% (35/205) with the nicotine patch, and 11.7% (24/205) with the placebo patch (p = .08). Compliance rates for return visits were 83%, 78%, 55%, and 52%, at 1, 2, 6, and 10 weeks, respectively.</s><s>Few studies have examined the effect of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) in COPD patients. Three hundred seventy COPD patients who smoked a mean of 19.6 cigarettes per day (mean, 42.7 pack-years; mean FEV(1), 56% of predicted). Carbon monoxide-verified abstinence rates and St. George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) assessed at 6 months and 12 months. Two hundred eighty-eight of 370 patients were evaluable for the final study end points. There was no significant difference in effect between low vs high behavioral support. The SGRQ score improved significantly in abstainers vs nonabstainers; the changes in mean scores were -10.9 vs - 2.9 for total score, and - 28.6 vs - 2.3 for symptom score, respectively.</s><s>Many smokers express a desire to quit smoking by gradually reducing the number of cigarettes they smoke until they stop completely. Subjects were instructed to gradually reduce their smoking while increasing their gum use over the course of up to 8 weeks. The study was conducted under over-the-counter conditions, with no counseling provided. During the reduction phase, active gum aided smoking reduction, and participants who reduced their smoking were more likely to achieve abstinence.</s><s>Most smoking cessation programs advise abrupt rather than gradual cessation. Prior to the quit day, the gradual condition decreased cigarettes/day by 54%, whereas the other two conditions decreased by 1% and 5%. Fewer smokers in the gradual condition (48%) made a quit attempt than in the abrupt (64%) or minimal (60%) conditions (p<.001). We conclude that among smokers who want to stop gradually in the near future, gradual cessation with nicotine pre-treatment does not produce higher quit rates than abrupt cessation. One liability of gradual reduction may be that it allows smokers to delay their quit date.</s><s>Heavy smokers (N = 408, smoking more than 25 cigarettes/day) were randomized to receive high-dose (25 mg) or standard-dose (15 mg) nicotine patch therapy delivered during the daytime only (16 hr) for a period of 6 weeks. The percentages of participants not smoking at 2-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups were 26 versus 20, 14 versus 16, and 14 versus 14 for the 15-mg and 25-mg doses, respectively. The results of this trial do not support the routine use of higher dose nicotine patch therapy in the treatment of nicotine dependence.</s><s>This study reports findings from an investigation of the efficacy of high-dose nicotine patch (NP) therapy for heavy smokers with a history of alcohol dependence. Differences between dose conditions were nonsignificant, although, unexpectedly, outcomes favored participants in the 21-mg NP condition. Nicotine abstinence rates in the 21- and 42-mg NP conditions on Week 36 follow-up were 16.9% and 9.2%, respectively. However, nicotine abstinence at follow-up was related to a longer length of alcohol abstinence.</s><s>The process and outcome of a smoking cessation program using behavior therapy alone (BT) or behavior therapy plus the nicotine patch (BTP) was studied in 64 participants. The coping behavior of the BTP group may have been more effective than that of the BT group, as indicated by their significantly higher level of self-efficacy.</s><s>To assess the effectiveness of transdermal nicotine therapy for smoking cessation and suppression of withdrawal severity in conjunction with two different adjuvant counseling treatments. Eighty-eight (study 1) and 112 (study 2) adult volunteers motivated to quit smoking. Eight weeks of 22-mg transdermal nicotine therapy with group counseling (study 1); 4 weeks of 22 mg followed by 2 weeks of 11-mg transdermal nicotine therapy with brief individual counseling (study 2). Transdermal nicotine treatment produced higher cessation rates at the end of treatment than did placebo with both adjuvant counseling interventions: 59 percent vs 40 percent (p < 0.05 in study 1) and 37 percent vs 20 percent (p < 0.05 in study 2), respectively. Survival analyses also revealed significant group differences in efficacy in both studies. Transdermal nicotine effectively augments smoking cessation rates with two different types of counseling treatment. Overall, the nicotine patch approximately doubles the sustained rate of smoking cessation.</s><s>In a placebo-controlled, double-blind, 2-year prospective study, 182 smokers were given either nicotine polacrilex gum containing 4 mg of nicotine (n = 92) or a placebo (n = 90). Of participants with a high nicotine-dependence score, those allotted to the nicotine group rather than to the placebo group were 13 times more likely to be abstaining at the 2-year follow-up.</s><s>This study evaluated the effectiveness of nicotine chewing gum in smoking cessation, when incorporated into a behaviorally oriented self-help program. One hundred ninety-seven patients were randomly assigned to nicotine gum with a self-help manual, a self-help manual without gum, or a control condition, but received no further treatment from the prescribing physician. Patients who were able to quit initially were most likely to remain ex-smokers in the self-help condition.</s><s>A pharmacologic factor contained 2 levels: transdermal nicotine path (TNP; 21 mg) and placebo. A self-help behavioral treatment factor contained 2 levels: video-enhanced self-help treatment manual and self-help treatment manual only. In secondary analyses, (at 2 months) and compliance with patch treatment regimen (at 2, 6, and 12 months) were associated with less relapse.</s><s>Nicotine replacement therapy has been shown to improve success rates in smoking cessation treatment. However, the available products cause adverse effects, which prevent some smokers from using them. A 1-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted in a smoking cessation clinic. Two hundred forty-seven smokers who smoked at least 10 cigarettes per day and who had previously made a serious attempt to stop smoking using nicotine chewing gum were recruited through advertisements. Randomization to treatment or control conditions were made at the first group session, with 123 participants receiving nicotine inhalers and 124 receiving placebo inhalers. The nicotine inhaler was an effective smoking cessation aid that produced a few mild and transient adverse effects.</s><s>A transdermal nicotine patch, which delivers 0.7 mg/cm2 per 24 h and is available in sizes of 10, 20, and 30 cm2 was tested in subjects from 21 general medical practices in a 3-month, placebo-controlled randomised double-blind study. After 1, 2, and 3 months of treatment 41, 36, and 36%, respectively, in the nicotine group were abstinent. Craving and withdrawal symptoms decreased more with nicotine substitution for cigarettes. The patches were generally well tolerated, although 25% of subjects in the nicotine group and 13% in the placebo group had transient local erythema after application of the patch; 5 members of the nicotine group withdrew because of poor cutaneous tolerance.</s><s>Cessation rates in smokers attending special clinics or their General Practitioners can be increased by transdermal nicotine (TNS). Self-reported complete abstinence from 12 to 52 weeks was validated by expired air carbon monoxide measurement at 12, 26 and 52 weeks. Cessation was related to increasing age (P = 0 center dot 02) and lower Fagerstrom score (P = 0 center dot 05). Minor skin reactions were more frequent in the TNS group (47% TNS; 34% P), as was nausea (12% TNS; 3% P). The suggestion that TNS produces an increase of 50% in relative terms (7% absolute increase) in smoking cessation over placebo in this population of hospital patients is sufficiently strong to warrant a further study large enough to answer whether or not this result was due to chance.</s><s>Smoking cessation in hospital patients given repeated advice plus nicotine or placebo chewing gum.</s><s>Since nicotine gum was introduced in the 1980s, nicotine replacement therapy has become the most widely used pharmacological smoking cessation treatment. Smokers (n = 1818) were assigned to a lozenge dose on the basis of nicotine dependence, assessed by time to the first cigarette of the day. Treatment with the nicotine lozenge resulted in significantly greater 28-day abstinence at 6 weeks, for the 2-mg (46.0% vs. 29.7%; odds ratio [OR], 2.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.59-2.79; P<.001) and the 4-mg (48.7% vs. 20.8%; OR, 3.69; 95% CI, 2.74-4.96; P<.001) lozenges, compared with placebo. Smokers who used more lozenges achieved significantly better treatment effects. Most adverse events were moderate and resembled those seen with nicotine gum.</s><s>Smokers with a history of alcohol dependence may have more difficulty quitting, might relapse to alcohol use, and might especially benefit from nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation. One hundred fifteen smokers with a history of alcohol dependence (median of 5 years previously) were randomly assigned to either a 21-mg nicotine patch or placebo in a trial designed to be as similar as possible to a prior study that examined smokers with no history of alcoholism. Smoking abstinence was not lower and the odds ratio for nicotine patch therapy was not greater in smokers with a history of alcohol dependence than in smokers with no such history. Heavy smokers with a history of alcoholism benefit from nicotine patch treatment. Although no smokers relapsed to alcohol use, a trial that follows up all subjects is needed to verify this.</s><s>This study was conducted to determine the efficacy of the nicotine patch in smoking cessation when combined with self-help materials, three brief visits, and telephone counseling. One hundred fifty-nine healthy volunteers who smoked at least one pack of cigarettes per day and desired to quit smoking were enrolled in a double-blind trial with 6-week treatment and 6-month follow-up periods. Subjects wore two patches per day for 4 weeks (25 mg of nicotine per 24 hours), then one patch per day for 2 weeks. Abstinence rates at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months were 29.5%, 21.8%, and 20.5% in the active group, and 8.8%, 3.8%, and 2.5% in the placebo group (P < or = .001 for each comparison), respectively. The nicotine patch is efficacious in smoking cessation over a 6-month period, when combined with only self-help materials, three brief visits, and telephone counseling.</s><s>This study examined the efficacy of transdermal nicotine in postmenopausal smokers, and whether a history of depression or hormone replacement therapy (HRT) moderated smoking cessation outcomes. Postmenopausal smokers (N=152) received intensive smoking cessation counseling and were randomly assigned to use either a 21-mg nicotine patch for 3 months, with a 1-month taper, or a placebo patch. Subjects who received transdermal nicotine were significantly more likely than placebo-treated subjects to remain abstinent from smoking during treatment, but not at the 1-year follow-up. History of depression was associated with a decreased likelihood to abstain from smoking throughout the study. These data indicate that transdermal nicotine may provide short-term benefits for smoking cessation in postmenopausal women.</s><s>Little direct evidence exists on the relative efficacies of different smoking cessation pharmacotherapies, yet such evidence is needed to make informed decisions about their clinical use. One thousand five hundred four adults who smoked at least 10 cigarettes per day during the past 6 months and reported being motivated to quit smoking. Other outcomes were initial cessation, number of days to lapse, number of days to relapse, and latency to relapse after the first lapse. With such protection, only the nicotine patch plus nicotine lozenge (odds ratio, 2.34, P < .001) produced significantly higher abstinence rates at 6-month postquit than did placebo. While the nicotine lozenge, bupropion, and bupropion plus lozenge produced effects that were comparable with those reported in previous research, the nicotine patch plus lozenge produced the greatest benefit relative to placebo for smoking cessation.</s><s>To estimate the safety and efficacy of treatment with 2-mg nicotine gum for smoking cessation during pregnancy. Biochemically validated smoking-cessation rates were not significantly higher with nicotine gum compared with placebo (after 6 weeks of treatment: 13% compared with 9.6%, P=.45; at 32-34 weeks of gestation: 18% compared with 14.9%, P=.56). Birth weights were significantly greater with nicotine gum compared with placebo (3,287 g [SD=566] and 2,950 g [SD=653], respectively, P<.001). Although nicotine gum did not increase quit rates, use of nicotine gum increased birth weight and gestational age, two key parameters in predicting neonatal wellbeing.</s><s>To determine whether 2-week pre-treatment with transdermal nicotine influences withdrawal symptoms or success rate of subsequent smoking cessation using nicotine patches. Healthy smokers (n = 200, 45% female) were allocated randomly to either active nicotine-patch (AP, 15 mg daily, n = 100) or placebo-patch (PP, n = 100) pre-treatment. Follow-up visits included measurement of exhaled carbon monoxide at the quit date, 2, 6, 10 and 26 weeks. Outcome measures were withdrawal symptoms composite score and abstinence rates. Overall sustained abstinence was documented in 17% of subjects at 6 months; 22% and 12% for AP and PP, respectively (P = 0.03). Retrospective subgroup analysis showed for subjects smoking >16 cigarettes/day sustained cessation rates were 22% and 9% for AP and PP, respectively (P = 0.01).</s><s>Smoking is considered as an addiction to nicotine for most subjects consuming 10 cigarettes or more per day. The effect of the nicotine patch against the placebo, both groups receiving placebo nicotine gum, has also been assessed. Healthy subjects (374) were randomized at their work-setting in a 1-year double-blind placebo-controlled trial: 149 subjects to active nicotine patch + active gum (group 1), 150 to active nicotine patch + placebo gum (group 2), and 75 to placebo patch + gum (group 3). Gum use was not restricted during the first 6 months, with recommendations to use at least four pieces a day. Abstinence rates in group 1 against group 2 were 34.2 and 22.7% (P = 0.027) at 12 weeks, 27.5 and 15.3% (P = 0.010) at 24 weeks, and 18.1 and 12.7% (P = 0.191) at 52 weeks. In group 3, abstinence rates were 17.3, 14.7, and 13.3% respectively at 12, 24, and 52 weeks. For group 1/group 2, OR at 12, 24, and 52 weeks were 1.72 (1.03-2.94) (P = 0.039), 2.04 (1.14-3.57) (P = 0.018), and 1.47 (0.76-2.76) (P = 0.125). No significant differences between the three groups in systemic and local adverse drug events were observed.</s><s>The Collaborative European Anti-Smoking Evaluation (CEASE) was a European multicentre, randomized, double-blind placebo controlled smoking cessation study. The objectives were to determine whether higher dosage and longer duration of nicotine patch therapy would increase the success rate. There was no significant difference in success rate between the two active treatment durations. In summary, a higher than standard dose of nicotine patch was associated with an increase in the long-term success in smoking cessation but continuation of treatment beyond 8-12 weeks did not increase the success rates.</s><s>Evaluation of the clinical efficacy and safety of a nicotine 2-mg sublingual tablet in smoking cessation. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of smokers using the 2-mg tablet for 3-6 months with follow-up to 12 months. Dosing was established according to baseline nicotine dependence, scored on the Fagerström Tolerance Questionnaire (FTQ): FTQ > or = 7, two tablets/hour (maximum 40/day); FTQ < 7, one tablet/hour (maximum 20/day). Smoking cessation programme in a department of oral and maxillofacial surgery. Craving during the first 8 days was significantly reduced among highly dependent smokers on active treatment compared to placebo. Adverse events were mild and tolerable, the most common being irritation and soreness in the mouth and throat.</s><s>Two hundred and ten subjects entered a trial to test the use of a chewing gum containing nicotine as an aid to stopping smoking. They were divided into three groups: nicotine chewing gum, placebo chewing gum, and control. By 6 months most of the non-smokers had relapsed, but the nicotine gum group (23%) was more successful than the placebo (5% or the control group (14%).</s><s>Stopping smoking. Do nicotine chewing-gum and postal encouragement add to doctors' advice.</s><s>Smoking cessation has been shown to be effective in randomized controlled trials. It is unclear though, whether interventions also work in routine primary care. Abstinence rates at the end of treatment (12 weeks) were 32.8% for MI patients, 34.8% for CBT, 35.3% for NRT, and 46.5% for BUP patients (ITT, intention to treat) (no differential effects). At 12-month follow-up continuous abstinence rates were: BUP, 29.0%; CBT, 20.9%; NRT, 29.6%; MI, 29.6%.</s><s>Transdermal nicotine therapy is widely used to aid smoking cessation, but there is uncertainty about its safety in patients with cardiac disease. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at 10 Veterans Affairs medical centers, we randomly assigned 584 outpatients (of whom 576 were men) with at least one diagnosis of cardiovascular disease to a 10-week course of transdermal nicotine or placebo as an aid to smoking cessation. There were 48 primary and 78 secondary end points noted in a total of 95 subjects. In the nicotine group, 11.9 percent of the subjects had at least one of the secondary end points, as compared with 9.7 percent in the placebo group (difference, 2.2 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, -2.2 to 7.4 percent; P= 0.37). Transdermal nicotine does not cause a significant increase in cardiovascular events in high-risk outpatients with cardiac disease.</s><s>Approximately 50% of African American smokers are light smokers (smoke < or = 10 cigarettes a day). The prevalence of light smoking in the United States is increasing, yet there has not been a single smoking cessation clinical trial targeting light smokers. The purpose of this 2 x 2 factorial, randomized clinical trial was to evaluate the efficacy of nicotine gum (2 mg versus placebo) and counseling (motivational interviewing versus health education) for African American light smokers. Participants received an 8-week supply of nicotine gum and six counseling sessions during the course of the 26-week study. However, a counseling effect emerged, with HE performing significantly better than MI (16.7% versus 8.5%, P < 0.001). Studies are needed to assess other interventions that may further improve quit rates among African American light smokers who are motivated to quit.</s><s>To determine the safety and efficacy of the nicotine patch and gum for adolescents who want to quit smoking. Twelve weeks of nicotine patch or gum therapy with cognitive-behavioral therapy, with a follow-up visit at 6 months (3 months after the end of treatment). Safety assessed on the basis of adverse event reports for all 3 groups, prolonged abstinence, assessed through self-report and verified with exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) levels of < or =6 ppm, in intent-to-treat analyses, and smoking reduction (CPD and thiocyanate concentrations) among trial completers. Participants started smoking at 11.2 +/- 1.98 years of age and had been smoking daily for 2.66 +/- 1.56 years; 75% had at least 1 current psychiatric diagnosis. Mean compliance across groups was higher for the patch (mean: 78.4-82.8%) than for the gum (mean: 38.5-50.7%). Changes in mean saliva cotinine concentrations throughout treatment were not statistically significant. Intent-to-treat analyses of all randomized participants showed CO-confirmed prolonged abstinence rates of 18% for the active-patch group, 6.5% for the active-gum group, and 2.5% for the placebo group; the difference between the active-patch and placebo arms was statistically significant. Decreases in the numbers of cigarettes smoked appeared to be offset by compensatory smoking. Additional study of nicotine gum, with enhanced instructional support, is needed to assess its efficacy among adolescent smokers.</s><s>Combined and separate treatment effects of nicotine chewing gum and self-control method.</s><s>The efficacy of physician anti-smoking intervention with 289 patients in a family practice setting was assessed. Comparison of those who actually used NCG to all other groups revealed significantly more users were abstinent at 1- and 3-month follow-up. A similar pattern occurred for proportion attempting cessation and smoking reduction.</s><s>Nicotine-replacement therapy is effective for smoking cessation outside pregnancy and its use is widely recommended during pregnancy. We recruited participants from seven hospitals in England who were 16 to 50 years of age with pregnancies of 12 to 24 weeks' gestation and who smoked five or more cigarettes per day. There was no significant difference in the rate of abstinence from the quit date until delivery between the nicotine-replacement and placebo groups (9.4% and 7.6%, respectively; unadjusted odds ratio with nicotine-replacement therapy, 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 0.82 to 1.96), although the rate was higher at 1 month in the nicotine-replacement group than in the placebo group (21.3% vs. 11.7%). Rates of adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes were similar in the two groups. However, low compliance rates substantially limited the assessment of safety. (Funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme; Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN07249128.</s><s>To assess the efficacy and safety of a repeat course of treatment with transdermal nicotine for cessation of smoking in a brief intervention setting. Randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial with follow up for 26 weeks. Smokers were motivated to quit smoking for a second time and smoked > or = 15 cigarettes a day. Twelve weeks' treatment with active transdermal nicotine patches or placebo and brief counselling at monthly visits. At 26 weeks the rates were 20/315 (6.4%) and 8/314 (2.6%) (3.8%; 0.6% to 7.0%; P = 0.021). Repeated treatment with transdermal nicotine together with brief counselling can improve the low success rates of smoking cessation in recently relapsed, moderate to heavy smokers. Questions remain about whether more intensive interventions or higher doses of nicotine could be more effective.</s><s>Nicotine gum has been shown to be effective in improving abstinence rates, and in reducing post-cessation withdrawal distress and weight gain. In the present study, we varied the amount of 2 mg nicotine gum prescribed to motivated quitters to explore the hypotheses (a) that motivated quitters would use more pieces of gum when coached and counseled to do so and (b) that there would be a dose-related effect of gum use on abstinence, withdrawal symptoms, and weight gain. One hundred seventy-seven volunteers were assigned to chew either 0, 7, 15, or 30, pieces per day of 2 mg nicotine gum. However, there was substantial variability in groups of subjects reporting similar amounts of gum use. Withdrawal symptom reporting was not related to either gum use or cotinine levels.</s><s>The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of different practice-based approaches to assist patients of primary care physicians to quit smoking and sustain cessation. After a period of training, they randomized 923 smoking clients, unselected for motivation toward quitting, to four different intervention groups: (i) minimal intervention, consisting of one single counselling session and a brief handout on quitting techniques; (ii) repeated counselling including reinforcing sessions at Months 1, 3, 6, and 9; (iii) repeated counselling and use of nicotine gum; and (iv) repeated counselling and spirometry. Biochemically validated smoking status was assessed at six and 12 months after recruitment. In no treatment group was the outcome significantly different from that for one-time counselling at the (P less than 0.05) level.</s><s>Randomised trial of nicotine patches in general practice: results at one year.

We studied the safety and efficacy of a transdermal nicotine patch in smoking cessation. We conducted a double-blind randomized study comparing the effects of a 16-hour nicotine patch (15 +/- 3.5 mg of nicotine in 16 hours) with those of a placebo patch. Of the 289 smokers (207 women and 82 men) enrolled in the study, 145 were treated with nicotine patches and 144 with placebo patches for 16 weeks.</s><s>To determine whether use of an oral nicotine inhaler can result in long term reduction in smoking and whether concomitant use of nicotine replacement and smoking is safe. 400 healthy volunteers, recruited through newspaper advertisements, willing to reduce their smoking but unable or unwilling to stop smoking immediately. Active or placebo inhaler as needed for up to 18 months, with participants encouraged to limit their smoking as much as possible. Corresponding figures after two years were 19 (9.5%) and 6 (3.0%) (P=0.012). Reduction with or without nicotine substitution may be a feasible first step towards smoking cessation in people not able or not willing to stop abruptly.</s><s>Smokers aged 18 to 65 years (N = 1,044) who were able to quit for 24 hr were randomized using a 2 x 2 factorial design to compare nicotine gum to no gum use and self-help materials to no use of materials. All participants were offered a $100 incentive to quit and stay quit for 6 months. Six-month abstinence was 27% in the gum groups, compared with 19% in the no-gum group (p = .002).</s><s>The Freedom from Smoking clinic programs offered by the American Lung Association are in widespread use. These programs were developed in the 1970s prior to the availability of nicotine gum in the United States. Abstinence outcomes at one week favored the nicotine gum conditions (86.3% of nicotine gum subjects were abstinent as opposed to 70.9% of comparison subjects, chi 2(1) = 9.79, p = .002).</s><s>To evaluate the effectiveness of the Nicotrol nicotine inhaler as an aid to smoking cessation in over-the-counter (OTC) versus health-care-provider (HCP) conditions. Abstinence at 1 year was.77% in the OTC condition versus 3.08% in the HCP condition [P<.01]. OTC nicotine inhaler appears to be ineffective, though quit rates are improved with HCP assistance.</s><s>Randomized efficacy clinical trials conducted in research settings may not accurately reflect the benefits of tobacco dependence treatments when used in real-world clinical settings. Effectiveness trials (eg, in primary care settings) are needed to estimate the benefits of cessation treatments in real-world use. Patients were randomly assigned to 5 active pharmacotherapies: 3 monotherapies (nicotine patch, nicotine lozenge, and bupropion hydrochloride sustained release [SR]) and 2 combination therapies (patch + lozenge and bupropion SR + lozenge). Six-month abstinence rates for the 5 active pharmacotherapies were the following: bupropion SR, 16.8%; lozenge, 19.9%; patch, 17.7%; patch + lozenge, 26.9%; and bupropion SR + lozenge, 29.9%. One in 5 smokers attending a routine primary care appointment was willing to make a serious quit attempt that included evidence-based counseling and medication.</s><s>Helping people to stop smoking: randomised comparison of groups being treated with acupuncture and nicotine gum with control group.</s><s>The effectiveness of nicotine gum in combination with a behavior modification program was studied. In the group with medium or low dependence, the success rates at the same time periods were 70%, 49%, and 39% for the subjects given the 2-mg dose and 38%, 22%, and 17% for those given placebo gum. The differences in success rates were significant at least at the p < 0.02% level for all comparisons. The study shows that high nicotine-dependent smokers need higher doses of nicotine replacement, in this case the 4-mg dose rather than the 2-mg dose, whereas 2 mg is superior to placebo among less dependent smokers. These results compare favorably with those reported from the more recent nicotine patch therapy.</s><s>Smokers (N = 126) were randomly assigned to 6-session smoking cessation treatments consisting of 1 of 2 counseling strategies (skills training or support) and 1 of 2 nicotine exposure strategies (nicotine gum or rapid smoking). Counseling and nicotine strategies were completely crossed; all four combinations resulted in equivalent 1-year abstinence rates. Skills training produced higher initial cessation and more coping responses posttreatment than did support. Rapid smoking, but not nicotine gum, produced tachycardia to the taste of cigarettes posttreatment, consistent with cigarette aversion.</s><s>The study examined the impact of counseling intensity (high vs. low) combined with either bupropion or the nicotine patch. Four groups of smokers under medication-blinded conditions were compared for treatment completion and abstinence at three follow-up points from the initiation of treatment (Weeks 12, 26, and 52). Both counseling groups had similar treatment completion rates (i.e., defined by a combination of counseling attendance and medication adherence levels). The study has implications for identifying the treatment needs of lighter smokers.</s><s>The effect of 2-mg nicotine chewing gum as an adjunct to group therapy for smoking cessation was studied in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial. After one year, 29% of the 106 subjects treated with nicotine chewing gum had remained abstinent throughout the year compared with 16% of the 99 subjects treated with placebo. In the nicotine group, 3% were still using the nicotine gum after two years.</s><s>We studied the effectiveness of chewing gum containing nicotine, in combination with group counseling, for subjects who were attempting to stop smoking. We used the Horn-Russell scale, based on a smoking questionnaire, to measure dependence on cigarettes; 173 smokers were grouped as highly dependent on nicotine or as having medium to low degrees of dependence. In the highly dependent group, abstinence from cigarettes was chemically verified after six weeks, one year, and two years; 81.5 percent, 44.4 percent, and 33.3 percent of the subjects given gum containing 4 mg of nicotine were abstinent after those follow-up periods; the rates of abstinence were 54.5 percent, 12.1 percent, and 6.1 percent, respectively, for the subjects given gum containing 2 mg of nicotine. This study indicates that the effectiveness of nicotine gum is not due to a placebo effect and that it is related to dose. The use of nicotine gum in appropriate doses should be helpful to persons who are attempting to stop smoking.</s><s>Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is a well-established treatment to aid smoking cessation, and current products recommend using NRT only after quitting smoking. However, theoretical arguments and previous data support the hypothesis that precessation use of NRT might be useful in reducing dependence on inhaled nicotine and serve as a helpful prelude to smoking cessation. Subjects smoked (a) their usual brands of cigarettes, (b) conventional low tar and nicotine cigarettes, or (c) denicotinized cigarettes. After the quit date, subjects received pharmacotherapy consisting of various doses of NRT (0, 21, or 42 mg/24-hr) in combination with the nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine (10 mg/day). Ad libitum smoking before the target quit date was modulated by nicotine patch treatment, and compensatory increases in smoking low tar and nicotine cigarettes were prevented by concurrent use of nicotine patches.</s><s>Earlier research indicated that a 10-session mood management (MM) intervention was more effective than a 5-session standard intervention for smokers with a history of major depressive disorder (MDD). In a 2 x 2 factorial design, the present study compared MM intervention to a contact-equivalent health education intervention (HE) and 2 mg to 0 mg of nicotine gum for smokers with a history of MDD. History-positive participants had a greater increase in mood disturbance after the quit attempt. Independent of depression diagnosis, increases in negative mood immediately after quitting predicted smoking.</s><s>The nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine was evaluated in a randomized smoking cessation trial. Four groups of participants (n = 20 per group) received nicotine plus mecamylamine, nicotine alone, mecamylamine alone, or no drug for 4 weeks before cessation. Nicotine + mecamylamine reduced ad lib smoking, smoking satisfaction, and craving more than either drug alone. Moreover, the orthostatic decrease in blood pressure caused by mecamylamine was offset by nicotine.</s><s>We tested whether starting nicotine polacrilex gum treatment 4 weeks before the quit date improved smoking abstinence rates compared with starting treatment on the quit date. In the precessation treatment group, participants received nicotine polacrilex gum (4 mg, unflavored) by mail for 4 weeks before and 8 weeks after their target quit date, and they were instructed to decrease their cigarette consumption by half before quitting. Instructions were limited to a booklet sent by mail and access to a smoking cessation Web site. Eight weeks after the target quit date, self-reported 4-week abstinence rates were 41.6% in the precessation treatment group and 44.4% in the usual care group (P = .61). Starting nicotine gum treatment 4 weeks before the target quit date was no more effective than starting treatment on the quit date.</s><s>To evaluate concurrent administration of mecamylamine (nicotine antagonist) with nicotine skin patch treatment for smoking cessation. Forty-eight healthy smokers who smoked at least one pack per day were studied at an outpatient smoking cessation research clinic. Secondary measures included point abstinence at 7 weeks, continuous abstinence at 6- and 12-month follow-up, and self-reported withdrawal symptoms. Point abstinence at 7 weeks was 58% for mecamylamine versus 29% for placebo, p = 0.044. At follow-up, continuous abstinence remained higher for mecamylamine: 37.5% versus 12.5% at 6 months (p = 0.046) and 37.5% versus 4.2% at 12 months (p = 0.004). Agonist-antagonist therapy, consisting of the nicotine patch with oral mecamylamine, may substantially improve current smoking cessation treatment.</s><s>1,218 smokers able to quit smoking for 48 hr were randomly assigned to one of 12 cells in a 4 x 3 fully crossed factorial experiment. A pharmacologic factor contained four levels: nicotine polacrilex (gum) delivered ad lib or on a fixed regimen, placebo gum, and no gum. Men who received nicotine gum were more likely to be abstinent at each follow-up (2, 6, and 12 months).</s><s>To test the effect of nicotine gum and placebo in smokers not motivated or not able to quit smoking with regard to smoking reduction and smoking cessation. The overall success rate for sustained smoking reduction was significantly higher at all time-points for active versus placebo gum (6.3% versus 0.5% after 24 months). Nicotine gum achieved significantly higher point prevalence cessation rates than placebo at 12 and 24 months [11.2% versus 3.9% (odds ratio = 3.1; 95% CI, 1.4-7.2 and 9.3% versus 3.4% (odds ratio = 2.9; 95% CI, 1.2-7.1), respectively]. Nicotine gum promoted cessation in this population of smokers unwilling to quit.</s><s>Previous studies have reported that smoking abstinence rates are increased when nicotine skin patch treatment is initiated prior to the target quit smoking date, as compared with conventional treatment beginning on the quit date. This study involved four groups of smokers (n = 100 per group) who received either nicotine patch (21 mg/24 hr) or placebo patch treatment for 2 weeks before the quit smoking date, and during this period, smoked their usual brands of cigarettes or switched to low-tar and nicotine cigarettes: a 2 (nicotine patch) x 2 (cigarette type) factorial design. From the quit date on, all groups received standard nicotine patch treatment, consisting of 6 weeks of 21 mg/24 hr, 2 weeks of 14 mg/24 hr, and 2 weeks of 7 mg/24 hr. Continuous abstinence rates were approximately doubled by precessation nicotine patch treatment.</s><s>Two hundred cigarette smokers in Thailand were randomly assigned to receive a chewing gum containing nicotine or placebo. After six months, significantly more of the group receiving the active gum than those receiving the placebo had given up smoking.</s><s>We analysed the effectiveness of a high intensity behavioural-cognitive intervention compared to minimal intervention started during a hospital stay, to see if the combination of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) can increase the quitting rate at 12 months of follow up. Of these, 717 smokers refused to enter the study and after a minimal intervention they were asked if we could telephone them after one year to ask if they still smoked. The follow up after discharge was carried out by outpatient visits or with telephone sessions. In this latter group there were significant differences (p=0.03) between those who had follow up in clinics (39% stopped) compared to those who were followed up telephone sessions (30%). A cognitive type intervention started on smokers when admitted to hospital increases quitting rates at 12 months, compared to a minimal intervention, and these rates increase even more significantly if NRT is added.</s><s>To evaluate the efficacy and safety of orally administered naltrexone, alone or in combination with nicotine patches, as a treatment for cigarette smoking. Randomized, partially-blinded, 2 x 2 factorial trial using naltrexone (active vs. placebo) and nicotine patches (active vs. none). The naltrexone dose was 50 mg taken once daily, and the nicotine patch dose was 21 mg/24-hour for the first 8 weeks and 14 mg/24-hour for the remaining 4 weeks. At the end of treatment, there was no effect of naltrexone on smoking abstinence. No significant effect of naltrexone was observed on daily cigarette smoking on cigarette craving during the study.</s><s>Effects of a transdermal nicotine substitution on psychological smoking cessation were investigated in a double-blind prospective study. 131 smokers were randomly assigned to three treatment conditions: All smokers underwent nine weeks of self-controlled smoking cessation. Nicotine-treated subjects reached significantly higher abstinence rates during and at the end of treatment than both placebo- and control-subjects: 69% in the nicotine condition, 51.2% and 44.4% under placebo and control conditions respectively. Effects are influenced by initial cigarette consumption, with the light smokers benefitting most from the nicotine patch. Self-assessments suggest an aversive effect of transdermal nicotine on cigarette taste.</s><s>The transdermal nicotine patch has proved an effective aid to smoking cessation. The ease of securing good compliance gives it a potential advantage over nicotine gum as an adjunct to brief advice and support in primary care settings where the major public health impact is obtained. We report here the definitive results of the full sample, including dose effects, predictors of outcome and other issues of theoretical and practical interest. Dose increase and abrupt vs. gradual reduction of patch dosage were also randomized and follow-ups conducted at 1, 3, 6, 12, 26 and 52 weeks. Outcome was measured by self-reported complete abstinence from week 3 to 52 with biochemical validation at all follow-up points. Nicotine patch treatment doubled the rate of continuous abstinence up to 1 year (nicotine 9.6%, placebo 4.8%, p < 0.01); it most likely worked by reducing withdrawal symptoms. It enhanced cessation during the first week and reduced relapse during the second week. Although pre-treatment dependence on cigarettes was prognostic of failure, the patches were equally helpful to both highly and less dependent smokers.</s><s>Nicotine replacement therapies have proved to be of value in smoking cessation. However, not all smokers can use the nicotine gum or nicotine patch owing to side effects. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the nicotine nasal spray for smoking cessation. Two hundred forty-eight smokers were treated in small groups with eight counseling sessions over 6 weeks. The nonsmoking status was verified by expired carbon monoxide less than 10 ppm. Significantly more subjects in the nicotine group were continuously abstinent for 12 months than in the placebo group (27% vs 15%; odds ratio, 2.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.15 to 4.12). Subjects with high scores (> 7) on Fagerström's tolerance questionnaire had a significantly lower success rate with placebo than with the nicotine spray.</s><s>Of 2110 adult cigarette smokers originally recruited to a study of the effect of antismoking advice in general practice, 429 who reported at follow up after one year that they had tried unsuccessfully to stop smoking were offered \"a special antismoking chewing gum,\" either nicotine gum or a placebo gum, in a double blind study. Of 200 who were willing to try the gum, 101 were randomly allocated to the nicotine gum and 99 to the placebo gum. The value of nicotine chewing gum, if any, can be quite small when it is used in general practice.</s><s>The authors compared the outcome of 208 smokers treated with fixed-dose transdermal nicotine (n = 69), tapered-dose transdermal nicotine (n = 71), or buspirone (n = 68). Fixed-dose transdermal nicotine was given at a dose of 21 or 22 mg/day for 6 weeks. Both transdermal nicotine regimens were initiated on the evening before the attempted quit date. Buspirone was started 21 days before the quit attempt and continued for 7 days after the quit attempt. Smoking cessation was assessed by patient diaries and random plasma thiocyanate determinations.</s><s>The authors examined the effect of 24-hour nicotine patches in smoking cessation among over-the-counter customers in Denmark, based on a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Participants were consecutive customers to whom nicotine patches were offered as the only treatment. Forty-two pharmacies in the areas of Aarhus and Copenhagen in Denmark participated in the trial, and 522 customers who smoked 10 or more cigarettes per day were randomized to either nicotine patches or placebo from January to March 1994. Customers with chronic diseases and pregnant or breastfeeding women were excluded from the trial. Those smoking 20 or more cigarettes per day started on a dose of 21-mg/day patches. Customers who smoked less started on patches of 14 mg/day; and for all of the participants, the dose was gradually reduced to 7-mg/day patches during the study period. Smoking behavior and compliance were recorded by means of self-administered questionnaires and telephone interviews. More side effects were seen in the nicotine group than in the placebo group, but none of the reported side effects were serious.</s><s>Randomized clinical trial carried out to investigate the effectiveness of the cognitive-behavioral approach and nicotine replacement therapy with nicotine patches for smoking cessation. After multiple adjustments, the abstinence proportions ratios seemed to follow a \"dose-response\" pattern: compared to GB, the ratios were 0.85 (G1-G2), 1.13 (G3-G4), 1.51 (GBA), 1.66 (G1A-G2A), and 1.75 (G3A-G4A). The \"dose-response\" pattern suggests that cognitive-behavioral could be the reasonable option in the smoking cessation therapy.</s><s>To examine the individual effects of supervised and intensive exercise as well as the combined effects of exercise and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) on (a) smoking cessation and reduction rates and (b) psychological and physiological processes during withdrawal. There were significant differences in a 7-day point prevalence but not continuous abstinence rates between treatment groups across targeted end points. Consistently higher cessation rates were seen when NRT was added to both treatment programs. Compared with CBT participants, exercise participants had significantly increased functional exercise capacity and had gained significantly less weight during program end points but these differences did not hold at a 12-month follow-up. We recommend that physicians and health care professionals recommend exercise and NRT together for highly motivated women interested in quitting smoking.</s><s>Improving and targeting nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) are cost-effective strategies for reducing adverse health consequences for smokers. However, prior work has not identified the optimal precessation dose or means for personalizing NRT. NRT dose, level of nicotine dependence and genotype scores displayed significant interactive effects on successful quitting. Successful abstinence also was predicted by CO reductions during precessation NRT. These results document ways in which smoking cessation strategies can be personalized based on levels of nicotine dependence, genotype scores and CO monitoring. These assessments, taken together, can help match most smokers with optimal NRT doses and help rapidly identify some who may be better treated using other methods.</s><s>In this double-blind, placebo-controlled smoking cessation treatment study, 608 participants were randomly assigned to receive active bupropion and active 4-mg gum (AA, n = 228), active bupropion and placebo gum (AP, n = 224), or placebo bupropion and placebo gum (PP, n = 156). After the first week postquit there were no differences in abstinence rates between the AA and AP groups. We found no significant individual difference variables that moderated outcome beyond 1 week postquit.</s><s>This study examines whether adding nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for pregnant smokers increases rates of smoking cessation. Data were collected from 2003 through 2005; analyses were conducted in 2006 and 2007. Women in the CBT+NRT arm were almost three times more likely than women in the CBT-only arm to have biochemically validated cessation at both pregnancy time points (after 7 weeks: 24% vs 8%, p=0.02; at 38 weeks gestation: 18% vs 7%, p=0.04), but not at 3 months postpartum (20% vs 14%, p=0.55). Recruitment was suspended early by an Independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board when an interim analysis found a higher rate of negative birth outcomes in the CBT+NRT arm than in the CBT-only arm. More data are needed to determine safety parameters and to confirm the efficacy of NRT use during pregnancy.</s><s>This study was undertaken to assess the safety and efficacy of a treatment involving brief counseling and the nicotine patch among hospital inpatients and to identify variables associated with long-term smoking cessation following hospitalization. One hundred eighty-five patients were randomly assigned to one of three smoking cessation interventions: (1) A Minimal Care (MC) condition, consisting of a brief physician-delivered motivational message to stop smoking, (2) a Counseling + Active Nicotine Patch (CAP) condition in which patients received the motivational message, a 6-week supply of nicotine patches, and extended bedside and telephone counseling, and (3) a Counseling + Placebo Patch (CPP) condition identical to the CAP condition except the supplied patches contained no nicotine. Patients admitted for respiratory disease were more likely to quit than patients with any other diagnosis. The initiation of nicotine patch therapy during hospitalization appears to be safe when used among patients carrying a wide range of diagnoses.</s><s>To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a transdermal nicotine patch as an aid for smoking cessation in an over-the-counter setting. Multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 6-week duration with 18 weeks of follow-up. The randomized sample consisted of 802 adults (mean age, 39 years) and was 89% white and 54% female. Guidance consisted only of package instructions and a smoking cessation self-help booklet. Quit rate was 12% for the active treatment group and 5.5% for the placebo group, based on total abstinence for 4 consecutive weeks (P = .001) compared with quit rates of 19.5% and 7.5% for active treatment and placebo groups, respectively, based on point prevalence data at week 6. At least 1 adverse event was reported by 57% receiving the nicotine patch and 39% receiving placebo (P<.001).</s><s>This study assessed the efficacy and safety of a nicotine sublingual tablet in smoking cessation in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled outpatient trial conducted between January 1996 and May 1997. Two hundred and forty-one adult smokers (> or = 10 cigarettes/day for at least 3 years) used nicotine 2-mg sublingual tablet (n = 120) or placebo (n = 121) for up to 6 months (a 3-month treatment period followed by a 3-month tapering period). Self-reported abstinence was measured from week 2 onwards, confirmed by expired carbon monoxide (CO) levels <10 ppm at each visit (1, 2, 3 and 6 weeks and 3, 6 and 12 months). Adverse events were mild and transient and reflected those reported with existing nicotine replacement formulations.</s><s>To assess the level of nicotine replacement, evidence of nicotine toxicity, and withdrawal symptom relief with placebo and 11-, 22-, and 44-mg/d doses of transdermal nicotine. Seventy-one cigarette smokers stratified according to light (n = 23), moderate (n = 24), and heavy (n = 24) smoking rates. At week 4, the dosage of those initially assigned to 44 mg/d was reduced to 22 mg/d. Withdrawal symptoms and nicotine toxicity were assessed daily through questionnaires during the inpatient stay. There was a positive association between the week 2 patch dose and the biochemically confirmed abstinence at the end of patch therapy (P = .007) but not for subsequent follow-up times. A higher percentage of cotinine replacement was associated with the higher 8-week smoking abstinence rate (P = .03), an association not found at long-term follow-up. A 44-mg/d dose of nicotine patch therapy appears to be safe for use in heavy smokers. Cigarette smoking rates can be used to estimate the initial nicotine patch dose. Achieving a greater percentage of nicotine replacement may increase the efficacy of nicotine patch therapy.</s><s>Nicotine-containing chewing gum in smoking cessation: a double blind trial with half year follow-up.</s><s>This study was designed to see whether the offer and prescription of nicotine chewing gum would enhance the efficacy of general practitioners' advice to stop smoking. A sample of 1938 cigarette smokers who attended the surgeries of 34 general practitioners in six group practices were assigned by week of attendance (in a balanced design) to one of three groups: (a) non-intervention controls, (b) advice plus booklet, and (c) advice plus booklet plus the offer of nicotine gum. After correction for those who refused or failed chemical validation and those who switched from cigarettes to a pipe or cigars, the proportions who were abstinent at four months and still abstinent at one year were 3.9%, 4.1%, and 8.8% in the three groups, respectively. These percentages are based on all cigarette smokers who attended the surgeries including those who did not wish to stop and those in the gum group who did not try the gum (47%). The self selected subgroup of 8% who used more than one box of 105 pieces of gum achieved a success rate of 24%. A general practitioner who adopts such a routine with similar success could expect to achieve about 35-40 long term ex-smokers a year and so save the lives of about 10 of them.</s><s>Seventy-eight smokers trying to quit were randomly assigned to 0-, 0.5-, 2- and 4-mg doses of nicotine gum and tracked for 9 months. In the 1st week of abstinence, self-administration of gum did not differ by dose (4 mg = 2 mg = 0.5 mg = 0 mg). Higher doses did not more effectively suppress withdrawal than lower doses nor induce more accurate nicotine identification (4 mg = 2 mg = 0.5 mg greater than 0 mg). Our results suggest the dose-response curves differ for nicotine gum's reinforcing, withdrawal-suppression and self-reported effects.</s><s>To evaluate the efficacy of a new nicotine inhaler system for smoking cessation. Medical outpatient clinic with physicians experienced in smoking cessation assistance. Continuous smoking abstinence at weeks 6, 12, 24, and 52, verified by measurements of carbon monoxide in expired air. The respective success rates were 28% and 12% after 6 weeks, 21% and 9% after 12 weeks, 17% and 8% after 6 months, and 15% and 5% after 1 year (P = .02 to .001). The treatment was well tolerated, and no serious adverse events were reported. In this setting the nicotine inhaler appeared safe to use and increased success rates of smoking cessation attempts.</s><s>We used the Heaviness of Smoking Index, a subset of the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence, to classify 608 cigarette smokers planning a cessation attempt as low or high in nicotine dependence. Subjects were also provided brief (5-10 min per visit) behavioral counseling during a 1-year period of follow-up. At 1 year post-cessation, quit rates were 11.2, 19.5, and 18.4% for low-dependence smokers receiving placebo, 2-mg, and 4-mg gum, respectively (plinear trend = 0.20). The interaction of nicotine-gum dose and dependence group was not significant (p = 0.42), nor did the 2-mg and 4-mg doses differ significantly in effectiveness, though both 2-mg and 4-mg gum were significantly more effective than placebo gum. The 4-mg dose provided a non-significant increase in cessation rates for high-dependence smokers. Smoking history and demographic variables also have a significant impact on the outcome of a quit-smoking attempt.</s><s>This study determined whether higher dose nicotine patches are more efficacious than lower dose patches among heavy smokers. A randomized double-blind study compared 0, 21, 35, and 42 mg/day of a 24-h patch in 1039 smokers (> or = 30 cigarettes/day) at 12 clinical sites in the USA and one in Australia. Daily patches were used for 6 weeks followed by tapering over the next 10 weeks. Among the 11 sites with 12 month follow-up (n = 879), the quit rates were 7, 13, 9, and 19%. In post-hoc tests, none of the active doses were significantly different from each other at any follow-up. Longer durations of treatment may be necessary to show greater advantages from higher doses.</s><s>The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of the nicotine patch for smoking cessation in an over-the-counter environment. Participants (n = 958) were 18 years or older, had smoked at least 15 cigarettes daily for at least 6 months, and were enrolled at 3 study sites. Smoking cessation rates in the placebo-controlled trial were 16.8% and 9.6% at week 6 and 8.7% and 4.3% at week 24 for the active patch and placebo groups, respectively. In an over-the-counter environment, the 22-mg, 24-hour nicotine patch is effective and safe for smoking cessation treatment.</s>"

Survival analysis showed that pregnancy continued at least 35.5 days in 50% of clindamycin-treated women versus 20 days for control women (p = 0.03). Obstetric and microbiologic parameters associated with treatment outcomes were also sought. Clindamycin treatment of these women reduced the incidence of preterm premature rupture of membranes to that of uninfected subjects. Stratification by gestational age at enrollment showed clindamycin treatment to be associated with an increased interval to delivery only among mothers enrolled before 33 weeks' gestation (clindamycin-treated group, 40 days; placebo-treated group, 28 days; p less than 0.05).</s><s>To ascertain whether adjuvant ampicillin and metronidazole given to women in preterm labour with intact membranes would prolong pregnancy and decrease the perinatal mortality and morbidity.

Amniocentesis was performed, and chorioamnionic membranes were examined histologically and cultured for microorganisms after delivery. Patients with evidence of upper genital tract infection in either group had a significantly shorter interval to delivery, lower gestational age at delivery, lower mean birth weight, and increased neonatal hospitalization time. Lack of an antibiotic effect on the gestational age at delivery may be due to the low prevalence of upper genital tract infection among unselected women in preterm labor, to advanced preterm labor unresponsive to antibiotic therapy, or to an inability of antibiotics given alone to inhibit the cytokine response.</s><s>Although an association between subclinical intrauterine infection and preterm birth is well established, there is conflicting evidence regarding the benefits of antibiotic administration to women in preterm labor with intact membranes. A multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was designed and implemented by the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Network of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.

Primary outcome measures were recurrence (stroke and death) and clinical outcome at 6 months. Complete recanalization of vertebral dissections was associated with a favorable prognosis [OR 3.2 (95% CI 1.1-8.8; p = 0.02)]. In Mexico, DCA affects young adults and may present with a heralding stroke or TIA.</s><s>Spontaneous dissection of the extracranial internal carotid artery is uncommon and has been first described in 1959. This pathology can be envisaged when a middle-aged adult, free of any previous pathology or trauma, presents with latero-cervical pain followed by cerebral ischemic stroke. The spontaneous course of such a dissection most often (80%) leads to an almost complete resolution of clinical and angiographic signs.</s><s>In this study 11 patients aged between 34 and 57 years with clinical and angiographic findings typical of carotid dissection were thoroughly examined with transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) repeatedly during a follow-up period of 1-6 months. MCA embolism originating from the extracranial carotid artery with or without resolution could be detected by TCD in 5 cases. TCD data may thus improve the understanding of pathogenetics as well as rationales for individual therapeutic intervention in this particular disease.</s><s>To evaluate long-term outcome after extracranial internal carotid artery dissection (eICAD) in consideration of the applied antithrombotic therapy. Among 33 consecutive eICAD patients initially treated either with anticoagulation (n = 25) or with antiplatelets (n = 8), a standardized interview was performed after 28 +/- 22.1 months to analyze risks and benefits of both agents. In the antiplatelet group, none died and no subsequent ischemic events happened. Four anticoagulated patients developed seizures, compared to 2 patients with antiplatelets (p > 0.05). In the absence of iatrogenic side effects, both anticoagulation and antiplatelets seem to be safe for eICAD. The rates for death and stroke were low and outcome ratings did not differ between both agents.</s><s>No randomized study has yet compared efficacy and safety of aspirin and anticoagulants in patients with spontaneous dissection of the cervical carotid artery (sICAD). Prospectively collected data from 298 consecutive patients with sICAD (56% men; mean age 46 +/- 10 years) treated with anticoagulants alone (n = 202) or aspirin alone (n = 96) were retrospectively analyzed. Outcome measures were 1) new cerebral ischemic events, defined as ischemic stroke, TIA, or retinal ischemia, 2) symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and 3) major extracranial bleeding. The same was true for hemorrhagic adverse events (anticoagulants, 2%; aspirin, 1%).</s><s>Sixteen cases of spontaneous dissection of the cervical internal carotid artery (6 verified) are described. Headache, facial pain, a subjective bruit, oculo-sympathetic palsy and transient monocular blindness were present in various combinations in two-thirds of cases and their presence suggested the correct diagnosis.</s><s>To assess the risk of stroke, TIA, or dissection recurrence after a first event of cervical artery dissection (CAD). A neurologist and a radiologist reviewed all charts to validate diagnosis and collect data. In 2002, patients were interviewed by phone or during a visit by the local investigators. Four hundred fifty-nine patients (mean age 44.0 +/- 9.7 years) were included in the study. Among the 457 survivors, 25 (5.5%) could not be contacted in 2002 because they had moved. After a mean follow-up of 31 months, four (0.9%) patients presented a recurrent ischemic stroke attributable to either not yet completely recovered initial CAD (n = 2) or a recurrent CAD (n = 2). Ischemic events seem rarely to be in relation with chronic arterial lesions.</s><s>Most single-center studies are small and highlight the use of anticoagulation for treatment. In a retrospective review, we identified 22 patients who presented with BCI and assessed neurologic and survival outcomes on the basis of injury grade and treatment with anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy. Patient demographics were identified using the trauma registry at a single Level I trauma center. Neurologic outcomes were graded good (minimal to no deficit), fair (moderate deficit needing some assistance), poor (requiring institutionalization), and dead. All BCI patients underwent head computed tomography and four-vessel cerebral arteriography. Eight patients were not anticoagulated, five because of intracranial injuries, two who had surgical CCA repairs, and one with an aortic injury. Anticoagulation was associated with increased extracranial bleeding complications.</s><s>Our purpose was to know more about the symptoms and clinical and radiological outcome of spontaneous dissections of the internal carotid artery in a retrospective study of 68 patients aged 20 to 71 (mean 46). Nine percent of patients had minor symptoms such as a subjective bruit or painful Horner's syndrome, without an ischaemic event. Magnetic resonance imaging performed in 21 cases showed haemorrhage in the vessel wall. Doppler ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imagery are helpful in diagnosis and follow-up.</s><s>Spontaneous dissection of the internal carotid artery. Clinical, radiologic and evolutive aspects. Apropos of 46 cases.</s><s>Spontaneous dissection of the carotid and vertebral arteries (SDCVA) is considered a rare cause of stroke, particularly in countries with multiethnic population. The objective was to evaluate the clinical and neuroimaging features of patients with SDCVA from a multiethnic population. An initial questionnaire was completed and patients were followed prospectively. The analysis of clinical and neuroimaging data from patients with SDCVA allows a better understanding of the disease, leading to an earlier diagnosis and more appropriate treatment.</s><s>Cervicocephalic arterial dissections (CCAD) are an increasingly recognized cause of ischemic stroke in young adults. Various treatments have been suggested but no controlled trial has ever been performed. Medical treatment has included anticoagulant or platelet antiaggregant therapy. Surgical correction has been proposed for selected patients who have failed medical therapy. Percutaneous balloon angioplasty and stenting have been increasingly used in some patients, although long-term results are unknown. There were 15 men (56%) and 12 women (44%) with mean ages of 38 and 43 years respectively. Twenty-two patients had spontaneous and five had traumatic extracranial CCAD. Eighteen patients received anticoagulant therapy and nine platelet anti-aggregants. At the end of follow-up, 23 (85%) patients had either no disability or only minor sequelae (modified Rankin score: 0 to 1), and four (15%) patients had moderate limitations (modified Rankin score: 2 to 3). Two patients had a recurrent ischemic stroke, one unrelated to recurrent CCAD, and the other following percutaneous balloon angioplasty/stenting for treatment of a persistent vertebral artery pseudoaneurysm. The clinical presentation is variable, most patients having an ischemic stroke or TIAs.</s><s>The highly variable clinical course of cervical artery dissections still poses a major challenge to the treating physician. Preceding traumata, vascular risk factors, presenting local and ischemic symptoms, and patient-outcome were evaluated. Patients with VAD complained more often of neck pain, more frequently reported a preceding chiropractic manipulation and had a higher incidence of bilateral dissections than patients with CAD. Bilateral VAD was significantly related to a preceding chiropractic manipulation. This study emphasises the potential dangers of chiropractic manipulation of the cervical spine. Patients with dissection-related cervical artery occlusion had a significantly increased risk of suffering a disabling stroke.</s><s>Blunt vascular injuries to the head and neck (BHVI) represent some of the most devastating and morbid injuries seen by a trauma surgeon. Patients were identified and their charts reviewed individually with regard to multiple data points including the type of injury, its presentation, the treatment of the injury, and the functional outcome of the patient. Among the injuries noted were 14 internal carotid artery dissections and 8 carotid artery tears. Heparin was started within 48 hours of injury in 4 patients (17%) and was used in a total of 12 patients (52%). BHVI represent a serious cause of morbidity in the patient with multiple injuries. Patients with closed head injuries and carotid canal fractures appear most at risk.</s><s>Cervico-cerebral artery dissection.</s><s>Nonpenetrating carotid trauma is uncommon and frequently missed on initial examination. The cases of seven patients seen over a period of 21 years are presented and 100 cases from the most recent literature are reviewed. Causes and mechanisms of injury, clinical presentation, investigations, management, and outcome are discussed. The earliest symptoms and signs were a change in mental status, headache, unprovoked fall, focal weakness, neglect, and dysphasia. Two patients were treated surgically; one died, one with delayed symptoms from a pseudoaneurysm recovered completely.</s><s>The relation between primary headaches (PH) and pain related to spontaneous cervical artery dissection (SCAD) is still unclear, as well as the progress of PH after dissection. To investigate this relation, the characteristics of pain related to SCAD and changes in PH patterns after SCAD, we evaluated 54 consecutive patients. Twenty-six (74%) patients with PH reported improvement in PH pattern after a mean follow-up of 32 months.</s><s>Spontaneous dissection of the internal carotid artery is not well known in Scandinavia. Our experience of 12 cases indicates that the typical patient is a middle-aged man who after strenuous physical exertion suffers a transient ischemic attack or progressing stroke. The most typical finding is an extracranial stenosis or occlusion of the internal carotid artery. Irregular expansion, double lumen and aneurysmal dilation are also fairly common.</s><s>Doppler ultrasound screening of young patients presenting with stroke, identified 10 patients with reduced common and internal carotid blood flow without any evidence of atheroma. Seven received anticoagulant therapy, stopping any further neurological symptoms.</s><s>The authors analyse the detailed clinical course in an homogenous review of 17 cases reports of traumatic injury affecting the extracranial portion of internal carotid artery. Only cases in which there were neither cervical perforating wound nor atheromatous predisposing lesion were considered. As in cases reported in the literature, the young age of these patients, with prevalence in the second decade and in men, was attributable to the etiology. Doppler investigation was able to detect, with a rather satisfying reliability, anomalies in the carotid flow before angiography ; angiogram showed lesions nearly always facing first or second cervical vertebra and bilateral lesions in four instances. Medical therapeutics were disappointing, and this induced to consider an extension in preventive realization of extra-intracranial by pass, each time diagnosis is established and patient is lucid. In our review cranial or facial shock was constantly noted, always frontal and often mild. Other mechanisms like direct cervical shock may certainly be found, but we did not observe any instance in this review.</s><s>In younger patients, the clinical symptoms of sudden unilateral headache and facial pain, often combined with Horner syndrome and the cerebrovascular symptoms of TIAs or stroke, should indicate the diagnosis of spontaneous carotid dissection. An addition to noninvasive Doppler ultrasonography, B-mode and Duplex investigations, although more or less nonspecific, give some indications of the diagnosis; modern imaging techniques, especially MRI, can image the intramural hematoma directly.</s><s>Dissections cause approximately three per cent of non-haemorrhagic stroke and are usually observed in young and middle-aged patients. Vertebral artery dissection may cause brain stem ischaemia (subintimal dissection) or in rare cases a subarachnoid haemorrhage (subadventitial spread). Treatment with anticoagulants or acetylsalicylic acid seems recommendable, though scientifically unproven.</s><s>Ischemic optic neuropathy (ION) is an infarction of the anterior or, less frequently, posterior part of the optic nerve, usually due to a disease of small arteries supplying the optic nerve. None of the patients had signs of central retinal artery occlusion or ischemic ocular syndrome. Ischemic optic neuropathy occurred after a mean of 5.3 days (range, 3-8 days) following the first symptom, which was headache in 1 patient, transient monocular blindness in 2, and hemispheric transient ischemic attack in 1. One patient had associated Homer syndrome, and 2 had severe ipsilateral headache and orbital pain.</s><s>Between April 1976 and April 1986, cervicocephalic arterial dissections were diagnosed in 19 of 4531 patients undergoing cerebral arteriography for acute cerebrovascular symptoms.</s><s>[Spontaneous dissection of arteries supplying the brain].</s><s>Thirty (2.5%) of 1200 consecutive patients with a first stroke had a spontaneous dissection with occlusion of the cervical internal carotid artery (ICA). A suggestive picture with ipsilateral headache and oculosympathetic paresis was uncommon (17%), so that diagnosis was uncertain before angiography. During follow-up (mean, 3.2 years) with sequential Doppler ultrasonographic testing, 12 survivors had a good recovery and early reopening of the occluded ICA, and 11 had a poor recovery usually without reopening of the ICA. Contrary to current opinions, ICA dissection with occlusion causing cerebral infarction may often carry a severe prognosis.</s><s>Twenty patients with blunt mechanism injuries to the internal carotid artery were treated over a 10-year period. The purpose of this review is to assess the necessity and timing of anticoagulation as a primary therapeutic modality in patients with this injury. Two patients were treated with aspirin alone and recovered without deficits. Therefore, a total of nine patients were either not treated with heparin or had a significant delay in the initiation of heparin.</s><s>There are only few small studies assessing potential risk factors, comorbidity, and prognostic factors in adult spontaneous cervicocerebral artery dissection (CAD). Occlusion of the dissected artery, internal carotid artery dissection (ICAD), and recent infection in infarction patients were associated with a poorer outcome. ICAD patients had less often brain infarction, but the strokes they had were more severe. Seven (2.3%) patients died during the follow-up (mean 4.0 years, 1186 patient years).</s><s>Noniatrogenic traumatic extracranial internal carotid artery dissections were encountered in six patients (five men and one woman) 31 to 62 years old. Secondary complications, a result of distal thromboembolism, were evident in two patients. Treatment relieved transient ischemic symptoms or arrested progression of established neurologic deficits in each case. In select patients, early surgical intervention may lessen attending neurologic sequelae.</s><s>Five patients with spontaneous dissection of the cervical internal carotid artery (CICA) are reported.</s>"

        "Abstracts": "<s>To determine whether reminder cards in medical records enhance the effectiveness of audit with feedback in improving the care of patients taking long term benzodiazepine drugs. Randomised trial, practices receiving feedback only in one group and practices receiving feedback plus reminder cards in the other group. Entries in medical records indicating compliance with five criteria of care: assessment of suitability for withdrawal; being told about dependency; withdrawal being recommended; withdrawal or continuing medication; and a consultation with the general practitioner in the past year. Of the 742 in the first samples, 543 (73.2%) were women, the mean (SD) age was 68.7 (14.9) years, and they had been taking a benzodiazepine for 10.1 (6.7) years. Reminder cards had only a limited effect and cannot be recommended for routine use. There were improvements in the care of patients of both groups of practices and further studies are indicated to determine the impact of both systematically developed criteria and reminders embedded into restructured medical records.</s><s>It is difficult to put research findings into clinical practice by either guidelines or prescription feedback. 199 general practitioners in 32 groups were randomised to participate in peer review meetings related to either asthma or urinary tract infections. The intervention feedback was designed to describe the treatment given in relation to recommendations in the national guidelines. Comparison of their prescription feedback with their own quality criteria gave each doctor the proportion of acceptable and unacceptable treatments. Difference in the prescribing behaviour between the year before and the year after the intervention. The mean proportion of acceptably treated patients in the asthma group was increased by 6% relative to the control group; this difference was statistically significant. Deriving quality criteria of prescribing by discussing guideline recommendations gave the doctors a basis for judging their treatment of individual patients as acceptable or unacceptable.</s><s>We studied two methods to reduce the ordering of laboratory and radiologic tests by medical residents in their first postgraduate year. The third group of residents served as a concurrent control, and data on the testing patterns of residents at the same hospital during the year before the study provided a retrospective control.</s><s>A project to improve physician performance in colorectal cancer screening was evaluated as part of an ambulatory quality assurance program. During a 31/2-year period, three different intervention strategies for improved compliance with the standard were sequentially implemented and assessed: educational meeting, retrospective feedback of group compliance rate, and retrospective feedback of individual compliance rate compared with that of peers. A pretest/posttest design was employed in evaluating the first two intervention strategies. During the second 6-month period, group 2 received feedback and group 1 did not.</s><s>To evaluate and compare the effects of two programmes of assessment of practice management in a practice visit: mutual visits and feedback by peers compared with visits and feedback by non-physician observers. A total of 90 general practitioners (GPs) in 68 practices; follow up after one year comprised 81 GPs in 62 practices. Change was defined as the difference in score between the first visit and the visit after one year on 208 indicators and on 33 dimensions of practice management. Data of 44 mutual visits by peers were compared with data of 46 visits by non-physician observers.</s><s>Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) measurements in patients with diabetes mellitus contribute to glycemic control, and, therefore to lower diabetic complication rates. Determine if an intervention that includes claims-based feedback about patterns of HbA1C measurement results in more frequent monitoring of HbA1C in diabetic Medicare beneficiaries. Rates for each quality indicator increased from 1996 to 1998 for both the intervention and comparison groups, although increases were larger for intervention counties. Differences for other indicators were small, although positive and favoring the intervention, and lacked statistical significance.</s><s>End-stage renal disease (ESRD) Networks are quality improvement organizations that collect, analyze, and report information to clinicians and allied health providers about discrepancies between observed patterns of care of ESRD patients and what has been recommended by clinical practice guidelines. The authors evaluated this process of quality improvement by selecting 42 treatment centers in a single ESRD Network with the lowest facility-specific mean urea reduction ratio (URR). Similarly, time on dialysis increased 7.5 min on average among patients in intervention centers but decreased 2 min for patients in comparison centers (P = 0.03). These results demonstrate that Network feedback, coupled with the intensive intervention, resulted in improvement in care that would otherwise not have occurred.</s><s>Quality improvement collaboratives are used to improve health care quality, but their efficacy remains controversial. To assess the effects of a quality improvement collaborative on preoperative antimicrobial prophylaxis. Longitudinal cluster randomized trial, with the quality improvement collaborative as the intervention. The groups did not differ in the change in proportion of patients who received a properly timed antimicrobial prophylaxis dose (-3.8 percentage points [95% CI, -13.9 to 6.2 percentage points]) after adjustment for region, hospital size, and surgery type. Hospitals volunteered for the effort, thereby resulting in selection for participants who were motivated to change.</s><s>To assess whether providing customized clinical information to patients and physicians improves safety or quality of diabetes care. Study subjects included 123 primary care physicians and 3,703 eligible adult diabetic patients with elevated A1C or LDL cholesterol, who were randomly assigned to receive customized feedback of clinical information as follows: 1) patient only, 2) physician only, 3) both the patient and physician, or 4) neither patient nor physician. Study interventions did not improve A1C test ordering (P = 0.35) and negatively affected LDL cholesterol test ordering (P < 0.001) in the 12 months postintervention. Interventions did not reduce risky prescribing events or increase treatment intensification. Future researchers should consider providing point-of-care decision support with redesign of office systems and/or incentives to increase appropriate actions in response to decision-support information.</s><s>The effect of quality assurance activities on the quality of mental health services.</s><s>Previous research has found that wellness visits, recall and reminder systems, and standing orders are associated with higher rates of delivery of preventive services in primary care practices. However, there is little information about how to help practices implement these processes. One clinician/nurse team from each of 24 practices was randomly assigned to one of 2 study arms. Implementation of the 3 targeted processes was determined by a blinded 3-clinician panel that reviewed transcribed clinician interviews before and after intervention using performance definitions. Rates of delivery of selected preventive services were determined by chart audit. Neither clinician and practice characteristics nor clinician readiness to change predicted implementation.</s><s>Laboratory services play an important part in screening, diagnosis, and management of patients within primary care. The interventions were quarterly feedback of practice requesting rates for nine laboratory tests, enhanced with educational messages, and brief educational reminder messages added to the test result reports for nine laboratory tests. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN06490422. The effect of the interventions varied across the targeted tests individually, although the number of tests requested for both interventions was generally reduced.</s><s>Disease registries, audit and feedback, and clinical reminders have been reported to improve care processes. Randomized controlled trial conducted in a resident continuity clinic during the 2003-2004 academic year. Seventy-eight categorical Internal Medicine residents caring for 483 diabetic patients participated. Residents randomized to the intervention (n = 39) received instruction on diabetes registry use; quarterly performance audit, feedback, and written reports identifying patients needing care; and had letters sent quarterly to patients needing hemoglobin A1c or cholesterol testing. Residents randomized to the control group (n = 39) received usual clinic education.</s><s>Hospital report cards are increasingly being implemented for quality improvement despite lack of strong evidence to support their use. To determine whether hospital report cards constructed using linked hospital and prescription administrative databases are effective for improving quality of care for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Hospitals were randomly assigned to receive rapid (immediate; n = 38 hospitals and 2533 patients) or delayed (14 months; n = 38 hospitals and 3142 patients) confidential feedback on quality indicators constructed using administrative data. Quality indicators pertaining to processes of care and outcomes of patients admitted between 4 and 10 months after randomization. At follow-up, adjusted prescription rates within 30 days after discharge were similar in the early vs late groups (for beta-blockers, odds ratio [OR], 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82-1.37; for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.90-1.52; for lipid-lowering drugs, OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.86-1.50; and for aspirin, OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.84-1.33). Feedback based on one-time, confidential report cards constructed using administrative data is not an effective strategy for quality improvement regarding care of patients with AMI.</s><s>A crossover randomized controlled trial of cycles of quality assurance in 16 primary care (8 medical, 8 pediatric) group practices was conducted. Of four medical and four pediatric tasks important to patient outcome, two were randomly assigned to experimental intervention (a quality assurance cycle), and two were also measured and used as blinded controls for each medical or pediatric group practice. Task performance was measured in each group for 12 months prior to, 9 months during, and 9 months after the experimental intervention, using as a performance score the percentage of evaluation criteria failed of those applicable to a case.</s><s>Guidelines are frequently used in an attempt to influence the performance of health professionals, and a national agency has been established in England and Wales to develop and disseminate guidelines. Professionals prefer short guidelines that highlight key recommendations, but whether such guidelines are more likely to be implemented is unknown. Eighty-one general practices in Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire, North Derbyshire, and Nottinghamshire. Patients with angina in practices that had received criteria or criteria plus feedback reported better symptom control. The dissemination of guidelines in the format of prioritized review criteria does not increase adherence to recommendations in comparison with the traditional guideline format, and the further provision of feedback has minimal additional effect.</s><s>Publicly released report cards on hospital performance are increasingly common, but whether they are an effective method for improving quality of care remains uncertain. To evaluate whether the public release of data on cardiac quality indicators effectively stimulates hospitals to undertake quality improvement activities that improve health care processes and patient outcomes. Follow-up performance data (between April 2004 and March 2005) also were collected. The publication of the early feedback hospital report card did not result in a significant systemwide improvement in the early feedback group in either the composite AMI process-of-care indicator (absolute change, 1.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.2% to 5.1%; P = .43) or the composite CHF process-of-care indicator (absolute change, 0.6%; 95% CI, -4.5% to 5.7%; P = .81). During the follow-up period, the mean 30-day AMI mortality rates were 2.5% lower (95% CI, 0.1% to 4.9%; P = .045) in the early feedback group compared with the delayed feedback group. Public release of hospital-specific quality indicators did not significantly improve composite process-of-care indicators for AMI or CHF.</s><s>Medical record audits have been used to provide physicians with feedback about their compliance with preventive health and disease management recommendations. There were no significant differences in baseline performance between the residents in the intervention and control group. There were no differences in performance scores between residents receiving report cards and those who had not in immunizations, counseling, total preventive health, diabetes, hypertension, and total disease management. Intensive data-based feedback using report cards may not be a successful way to improve ambulatory performance of medical house officers.</s><s>A randomized controlled trial of several strategies designed to reduce the use of laboratory tests by house staff was performed in two parts. Part 1 compared cost education, cost audits, and both methods combined, all after a baseline observation period. Significant reductions were achieved only in the combination group for the categories of total tests (9.4%) and Sequential Multiple Analysis (SMA)-12 (10.8%), but not for charges, SMA-6, or complete blood cell counts (CBCs). Part 2 compared a group subjected to faculty chart review with a control group.</s><s>Despite the recommendations of numerous clinical practice guidelines, testing of at-risk women for Chlamydia trachomatis infection remains low. We evaluated an intervention to increase guideline-recommended chlamydia screening. Clinic-level intervention strategies included use of clinic-based opinion leaders, individual measurement and feedback, and exam room reminders. A second patient-level intervention, a chart prompt to screen for chlamydia, was delivered in a random sample of 3509 women. However, testing rates increased significantly among women making preventive care visits (OR, Pap test visit = 1.23, 95% CI, 1.01-1.51, P = 0.04; OR, physical exam visit = 1.22, 95% CI 1.06-1.42, P = 0.009, intervention vs. control clinics).</s><s>Standard Treatment Guidelines were introduced to all prescribers at provincial hospitals in Lao PDR and treatment indicators were developed within the National Drug Policy programme to monitor compliance. To evaluate the effects of an educational intervention to improve treatment practices of malaria, diarrhoea and pneumonia. Randomized controlled trial with prescribers at 24 departments at eight provincial hospitals, matched into four pairs. The 6-month intervention was conducted by members of the Drug and Therapeutics Committees, and comprised monthly audit sessions in the form of outcome feedback using indicator scores on recorded treatment of malaria, diarrhoea and pneumonia. For pneumonia, improvement was seen in both the intervention and control groups. Audit-feedback systems to improve quality of care are feasible and effective also in hospital settings in low-income countries.</s><s>Although clinical-practice guidelines (CPGs) are implemented on the assumption that they will improve the quality, efficiency, and consistency of health care, they generally have limited effect in changing physicians' behavior. The authors implemented a four-stage program of stepwise collaborative efforts with academic institutions composed of developing quantitative tools to evaluate prescribing patterns, updating CPGs, collecting MDs' input via focus groups and quantitative surveys, and conducting a randomized controlled trial of a two-stage, multipronged intervention. The tools and data-generating capabilities designed and constructed in Stage I of the project were integral components of all subsequent stages of the program. This study provides a template for introducing the component of experimentation essential for cultivating an evidence-based culture. This process, composed of collaborative efforts between academic institutions and a managed care organization, may be beneficial to other health care systems.</s><s>The aim of this paper was to evaluate the efficacy of QCs for asthma care working either with general feedback or with an open benchmark. Twelve QCs, involving 96 general practitioners, were organized in a randomized controlled trial. Six worked with traditional anonymous feedback and six with an open benchmark; both had guided discussion from a trained moderator. Forty-three primary care practices agreed to give out questionnaires to patients to evaluate the efficacy of QCs. Use of inhaled steroids at baseline was high (69%) and self-management low (asthma education 27%, individual emergency plan 8%, and peak flow meter at home 21%). Guideline adherence in drug treatment increased (P = 0.19), and asthma steps improved (P = 0.02).</s><s>Failure of low-cost audits with feedback to reduce laboratory test utilization.</s><s>In Belgium, general practitioners (GPs) mainly manage oral anticoagulation therapy. Group B additionally received feedback every 2 months on their anticoagulation performance; group C determined the international normalized ratio (INR) with a CoaguChek device in the doctor's office or at the patient's home; and group D received Dawn AC computer assisted advice for adapting oral anticoagulation. There was a significant increase in per cent of time within 0.5 INR from target, from 49.5% at baseline to 60% after implementing the different interventions. However, neither the per cent in target range nor the event rates differed among the four groups.</s><s>The effectiveness of recruiting local medical opinion leaders to improve quality of care is poorly understood. Randomized controlled trial with hospital as the unit of randomization, intervention, and analysis. They focused on (1) evidence (drug efficacy), (2) comparative performance, and (3) barriers to change. For beta-blockers, the respective changes were +0.31 (63% increase from 0.49 at baseline) vs +0.18 (30% increase from baseline) for controls (P=.02). The intervention did not increase thrombolysis in the elderly (from 0.73 at baseline), but nearly two thirds of eligible nonrecipients were older than 85 years, had severe comorbidities, or presented after at least 6 hours. Secular changes in knowledge and hospital protocols may extinguish outdated practices (eg, prophylactic lidocaine). However, it is more difficult to increase use of effective but riskier treatments (eg, thrombolysis) for frail elderly patients.</s><s>Previous interventions targeting primary care practitioners with the aim of increasing preventive care delivery have demonstrated limited effectiveness. The primary aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a computerized continuing medical education program to increase rates of three screening behaviors (cholesterol, blood pressure, and cervical screening) and to identify three risk behaviors (smoking, alcohol consumption, benzodiazepine use) in general practice. The intervention was delivered using a touch-screen computer located in the surgery waiting area. The preventive behaviors of interest were patient smoking, alcohol use, benzodiazepine use, and blood pressure, cholesterol and cervical screening using the Papanicolou test.</s><s>The purpose of the study was to determine if simply providing nursing facilities with comparative quality performance information and education about quality improvement would improve clinical practices and subsequently improve resident outcomes, or if a stronger intervention, expert clinical consultation with nursing facility staff, is needed. Nursing facilities (n = 113) were randomly assigned to one of three groups: workshop and feedback reports only, workshop and feedback reports with clinical consultation, and control. Minimum Data Set (MDS) Quality Indicator (QI) feedback reports were prepared and sent quarterly to each facility in intervention groups for a year. Simply providing comparative performance feedback is not enough to improve resident outcomes. It appears that only those nursing homes that sought the additional intensive support of the GCNS were able to effect enough change in clinical practice to improve resident outcomes significantly.</s><s>To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of a tailored multifaceted strategy, delivered by a national clinical effectiveness programme, to implement a guideline on induced abortion. All 26 hospital gynaecology units in Scotland providing induced abortion care. Following the identification of barriers to guideline implementation, intervention units received a package comprising audit and feedback, unit educational meetings, dissemination of structured case records and promotion of a patient information booklet.</s><s>Current understanding of implementation methods is limited, and research has focused on changing doctors' behaviors. Using a factorial design, cluster randomized controlled trial, we evaluated 194 community nurses in 157 family practices and 1078 patients with diagnosis of urinary incontinence (UI) for nurses compliance with evidence-linked review criteria for the assessment and management of UI and impact on psychologic and social well-being and symptoms. In the outreach arms, nurses' self-reported barriers informed development of tailored strategies. In comparison with educational materials alone, the implementation methods tested did not improve care at 6 months follow-up. Adjustment for caseload size, severity or duration of UI and patients' age did not alter results. Greater understanding of the underlying processes in improving performance within multidisciplinary teams through further, theory-driven studies with \"no intervention\" control groups and longer follow-up are needed.</s><s>Statistical process control (SPC) charts have previously been advocated for infection control quality improvement. Seventy-five wards in 24 hospitals in the UK were randomised into three arms: (1) wards receiving SPC chart feedback; (2) wards receiving SPC chart feedback in conjunction with structured diagnostic tools; and (3) control wards receiving neither type of feedback. The mean percentage reduction was 32.3% for wards receiving SPC feedback, 19.6% for wards receiving SPC and diagnostic feedback, and 23.1% for control wards, but with no significant difference between the control and intervention arms (P=0.23). Participants identified SPC charts as an effective communication tool and valuable for disseminating WA-MRSA data.</s><s>The number of inappropriate prescriptions for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in Sudan is suspected to be high. To evaluate the effect of multifaceted interventions on prescribing for STIs in the White Nile State, Sudan. The study involved 20 health centres randomly assigned to four different multifaceted interventions to improve prescribing. Audit and feedback together with seminars and practice guidelines reduced inappropriate prescriptions by 43% (p < 0.001).</s><s>Despite widely publicized hypertension treatment guidelines for physicians and lifestyle recommendations for patients, blood pressure control rates remain low. In community-based primary care clinics, we performed a nested, 2 x 2 randomized, controlled trial of physician intervention versus control and/or patient intervention versus control. Physician intervention included internet-based training, self-monitoring, and quarterly feedback reports. Patient intervention included 20 weekly group sessions followed by 12 monthly telephone counseling contacts and focused on weight loss, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension dietary pattern, exercise, and reduced sodium intake. Eight primary care practices (32 physicians) were randomized to physician intervention or control groups. The main effect of physician intervention on systolic blood pressure at 6 months, adjusted for baseline pressure, was 0.3 mm Hg (95% CI: 1.5 to 2.2; P=0.72).</s><s>Management of diabetes is frequently suboptimal in primary care settings, where providers often fail to intensify therapy when glucose levels are high, a problem known as clinical inertia. We asked whether interventions targeting clinical inertia can improve outcomes. A controlled trial over a 3-year period was conducted in a municipal hospital primary care clinic in a large academic medical center. Over an average patient follow-up of 15 months within the intervention site, improvements in and final HbA1c (A1C) with feedback + reminders (deltaA1C 0.6%, final A1C 7.46%) were significantly better than control (deltaA1C 0.2%, final A1C 7.84%, P < 0.02); changes were smaller with feedback only and reminders only (P = NS vs. control). Over a 2-year period, overall glycemic control improved in the intervention site but did not change in other primary care sites (final A1C 7.5 vs. 8.2%, P < 0.001).</s><s>To evaluate the effects of postal feedback with clinically relevant data on general practitioners' prescribing compared with feedback with aggregate data on prescribing patterns of asthma drugs. The first group received detailed and clinically relevant data on asthma drug prescribing patterns and a guideline statement. These data included tables with counts of asthma patients following classification of each individual's consumption of inhaled beta2-agonists and use of inhaled steroids. The second group received aggregate data on asthma drug prescribing patterns and a guideline statement, and the third group received feedback on an unrelated subject and served as control for the other groups.</s><s>To evaluate the impact of feedback on the prescribing of antibiotics supplementary to clinical guidelines in the treatment of respiratory tract infections. The first group received clinical guidelines on the treatment of respiratory tract infections plus postal feedback with aggregated data on their prescribing patterns for antibiotics. The second group served as controls for the first group and received the guidelines only. Interventions aimed at improving performance in general practice should go beyond just giving GPs information on whether they are living up to standards.</s><s>No single quality improvement instrument has proved consistently effective, but multifaceted interventions are believed to have the greatest impact. However, only little is known regarding what combinations are likely to be successful. A randomised controlled trial including 28 GPs in Ringkjøbing County, Denmark. Evaluation was based on registration of consultations with patients suffering from ischemic heart disease. An intervention strategy combining outreach visits, feedback and GP registrations is a promising way of improving the quality of preventive treatment in general practice.</s><s>To assess the effectiveness of three different methods of promoting secondary prevention of coronary heart disease in primary care. 21 general practices received intervention; outcome measured in 1906 patients aged 55-75 years with established coronary heart disease. At 18 months' follow up: adequate assessment (defined) of 3 risk factors (blood pressure, cholesterol, and smoking status); prescribing of hypotensive agents, lipid lowering drugs, and antiplatelet drugs; blood pressure, serum cholesterol level, and plasma cotinine levels. Adequate assessment of all 3 risk factors was much more common in the nurse and GP recall groups (85%, 76%) than the audit group (52%). However, these differences in assessment were not reflected in clinical outcomes. After adjustment for baseline levels, the advantage in the nurse recall group compared with the audit group was 10% (3% to 17%), in the nurse recall group compared with the GP recall group 8% (1% to 15%) and in the GP recall group compared with the audit group 2% (-6% to 10%).</s><s>Evidence exists that some dentists may be failing to perform adequate periodontal diagnostic and preventive care for their patients. Continuing education (CE) is an avenue that is frequently employed as a strategy to alter the style of practice. This paper presents an evaluation of a year-long continuing education intervention \"Periodontics in General Practice\", conducted among randomly selected private general dental practices in Adelaide, South Australia. The study employed a longitudinal quasi-experimental design, which allowed for evaluation of the effectiveness of the intervention among practices employing hygienists (n = 12) and not employing dental hygienists (n = 12), taking into account the covariates of baseline level of provision of periodontal services, the practice's level of participation in the intervention and attendance at other CE courses in periodontics over the year. A comparison group of practice (n = 12) did not participate in the intervention over the year.</s><s>We sought to determine whether tailored educational interventions call improve the quality of care, as measured by the provision of preventive care services recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force, as well as lead to better patient satisfaction. Physicians randomly assigned to the comprehensive intervention group also received peer-comparison feedback and academic detailing. Baseline and postintervention (2 to 2.5 years later) surveys examining the provision of preventive care and patient satisfaction were performed and medical records were reviewed. Mammography (90% versus 80%, P <0.01) and clinical breast examination (85% versus 79%, P <0.05) scores worsened in the education only group but not in the comprehensive intervention group. A physician-targeted approach of education, peer-comparison feedback, and academic detailing has modest effects on patient satisfaction and possibly on the offering of selected preventive care services.</s><s>To investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different guideline implementation strategies, using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) Guideline 42 \"Management of unerupted and impacted third molar teeth\" (published 2000) as a model. PRINCIPAL OUTCOME MEASUREMENT: The proportion of patients whose treatment complied with the guideline. Given the effectiveness results (no difference) the cost effectiveness calculation became a cost-minimisation calculation. The minimum cost intervention in the trial consisted of providing general dental practitioners (GDPs) with guidelines and the option of attending PGEC courses. Routine data which subsequently became available showed a Scotland-wide fall in extractions prior to data collection. In an environment in which pre-intervention compliance was unexpectedly high, neither CAL nor A and F increased the dentists' compliance with the SIGN guideline compared with mailing of the guideline and the opportunity to attend a postgraduate course.</s><s>We evaluated the effect of performance feedback on acute ischemic stroke care quality in Minnesota hospitals. A cluster-randomized controlled trial design with hospital as the unit of randomization was used. Care quality was defined as adherence to 10 performance measures grouped into acute, in-hospital, and discharge care. Following preintervention data collection, all hospitals received a report on baseline care quality. Nineteen hospitals were randomized with a total of 1,211 acute ischemic stroke cases preintervention and 1,094 cases postintervention. There was no definite intervention effect: both experimental and control hospitals showed significant secular trends with performance improvement.</s><s>The purpose of this study was to evaluate performance feedback delivered by on-site presentations compared to mailed feedback on improving acute myocardial infarction (AMI) care. We used a randomized trial including 18 hospitals nested within the Cooperative Cardiovascular Project. The experimental intervention group received a presentation led by a cardiologist and a quality improvement specialist. We assessed the proportion of patients receiving appropriate AMI care before and after the intervention. Both univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated no effect of the intervention in increasing the proportion of patients who received reperfusion, aspirin, beta-blockers, or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.</s><s>In the international Drug Education Project, a new educational program for peer groups of doctors was developed and tested to improve the treatment of asthma patients in The Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Slovakia. Individualized feedback on prescribing and the underlying decision strategy was presented and discussed within the group of doctors, in relation to existing guidelines. In a parallel, randomized controlled design the effect on competence and actual prescribing was tested. The proportion of patients treated with inhaled corticosteroids significantly improved in The Netherlands (effect size 1.27), and the proportion of oral corticosteroid use for exacerbation treatment increased both in The Netherlands and in Norway (effect sizes 1.99 and 0.87, respectively).</s><s>Family physicians have an important clinical role in assessment and management of suspicious skin lesions. As an educational tool, audit allows doctors to systematically review their practice and establish the quality of care they provide. Data based on their own patients, on the correlation between clinical and histologic diagnosis, and excisions of skin lesions were collated and reported to the intervention group. This study design has highlighted the difficulty in balancing the use of evidence-based educational strategies in an equivalent setting to normal practice with evaluation of performance using measures that include characteristics of practitioners' patients that cannot be controlled.</s><s>Professional Standards Review Organization claims data were used in defining, planning, implementing and evaluating an approach to an ambulatory medical care problem utilizing educational intervention.</s><s>The purpose of this study was to assess the impacts of individualized prescribing feedback and interactive small group education aimed at encouraging evidence-based prescribing in family/general practice. A two-by-two factorial randomized controlled trial was carried out involving 200 family physicians in British Columbia, Canada. probability that a patient would receive the evidence-based medication as first-line therapy). Using data from the provincial pharmacy registry (PharmaNet), prescribing preferences for antihypertensive agents were determined for all groups for a 6 month period before and after the interventions, based on 4394 patients receiving a first-line antihypertensive. Preference in the group receiving both module and portrait increased by +0.115 (CI 0.040-0.189). Evidence-based educational interventions combining personalized prescribing feedback with interactive group discussion can lead to modest but meaningful changes in physician prescribing. Clear messages, proper trial design and sensitive outcomes are necessary to demonstrate these changes.</s><s>We aimed to evaluate the effect of a medical audit on AIDS prevention in general practice. We conducted a prospective randomized controlled study performed as 'lagged intervention'. The participants were from general practices in Copenhagen and the Counties of Funen and Vejle, Denmark. Furthermore, no significant differences were observed regarding the content of these consultations or regarding the fraction of such consultations initiated by the GPs. Medical audit had no observed effect on AIDS prevention in general practice.</s><s>To evaluate the effect of a combined or a single educational intervention on the prescribing behaviour of general practitioners (GPs). The primary endpoint was effect on inappropriate prescribing according to the Medication Appropriateness Index (MAI). Medication appropriateness improved in the combined intervention group but not in the single intervention group. The mean change in MAI and number of medications was -5 [95% confidence interval (CI) -7.3 to -2.6] and -1.03 (95% CI -1.7 to -0.30) in the combined intervention group compared with the group with the educational meeting only and the no intervention group. A combined intervention consisting of an interactive educational meeting plus recommendations given by clinical pharmacologists/pharmacists concerning specific patients can improve the appropriateness of prescribing among elderly patients exposed to polypharmacy. Important limitations to the study include variability in data provided by participating GPs and a low number of GPs volunteering for the study.</s><s>We aimed to assess two methods of reducing GP requests for radiological tests in accordance with the UK Royal College of Radiologists' guidelines on lumbar spine and knee radiographs. We assessed audit and feedback, and educational reminder messages in six radiology departments and 244 general practices that they served. The study was a before-and-after, pragmatic, cluster randomised controlled trial with a 232 factorial design. The effect of audit and feedback was an absolute change of -0.07 (-1.3 to 0.9) for lumbar spine of 0.04 (-0.95 to 1.03) for knee radiograph requests, both relative reductions of about 1%. Any department of radiology that handles referrals from primary care could deliver this intervention to good effect.</s><s>To assess the effectiveness of feedback on the number of pathology tests ordered by general practices. Numbers of tests requested per thousand patients registered with each practice. RESULTS; There were no changes in the numbers of tests per thousand requested in either of the study groups for any of the tests. Feedback did not have an influence on test ordering by general practitioners in this study.</s><s>Improved pneumococcal vaccine (PPV) immunization for seniors is a national goal of the Medicare program. This study examined whether adding a simple telephone follow-up to an existing mailed physician performance feedback under the Medicare program would increase the impact on billed pneumococcal immunizations. Medicare fee-for-service claims data were used to select New York primary care physicians with high volume (n = 732) or African-American serving (n = 329) practices. Practices were also randomized to receive telephone calls directing attention to the mailing and further promoting improvements in PPV coverage or no active follow-up. However, improved methods may be needed to induce a large percentage of physicians to change.</s><s>The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficiency of different strategies of intervention to reduce prescription of hypnotics/sedatives in general practice. One group received personal information at meetings, another received written material about proper use of hypnotics/sedatives and information about their own prescription rate, and the third group constituted a control group. There was a general decline in the prescription rate recordings, but there were no significant differences between the intervention groups and the control group.</s><s>Antibiotics are a medication class for which inappropriate prescribing is frequently described. The participants were 251 randomly selected primary care physicians from southern Ontario who consented to participate (135 in the feedback group and 116 in the control group). Confidentially prepared profiles of antibiotic prescriptions coupled with guidelines-based educational bulletins were mailed to the intervention group every 2 months for 6 months. The control group received no intervention until after completion of the study. The median prescription cost of about $11 remained constant in the feedback group but rose in the control group (change of $0.05 v. $3.37, p < 0.002).</s><s>The objective of this study was to assess the effects of two brief training interventions to improve obstetricians' and midwives' explanations to patients of a routine prenatal screening test. Health professionals were randomly allocated to one of two intervention groups or a control group. Information-giving about the test and communication skills were assessed at baseline, post-training and 3-month follow-up from audiotaped consultations. Both intervention groups received a 1-h training session involving small group discussions focused around a video. Those receiving training without feedback significantly improved their communication skills and showed some improvement in information-giving. Greater and more sustained improvements may be found if all staff were trained, and trained on a regular basis.</s><s>Benzodiazepine use by elderly patients is associated with adverse outcomes including increased risk of falls and fractures, motor vehicle accidents and cognitive impairment. Recent studies suggest that individualized feedback and education to physicians may improve drug prescribing. In this study, we evaluated an intervention to address the inappropriate prescribing of benzodiazepines for elderly patients. After randomization, 168 physicians agreed to be in the intervention group and 206 in the control group. Although the proportion of long-acting benzodiazepine prescriptions decreased by 0.7% in the intervention group between the baseline period and the end of the intervention period (from 20.3%, or a mean of 29.5 prescriptions, to 19.6%, or a mean of 27.7 prescriptions) and increased by 1.1% in the control group (from 19.8%, or a mean of 26.4 prescriptions, to 20.9%, or a mean of 27.7 prescriptions) (p = 0.036), this difference was not clinically significant. There was no significant difference over the study period in either combination prescribing of benzodiazepines or in prescriptions for long-term benzodiazepine therapy.</s><s>The effect of clinical guidelines on resource utilization for complex conditions with substantial barriers to clinician behavior change has not been well studied. Physician groups were randomized to receive guideline education and individual feedback, supporting patient education materials, both, or neither. The impact on guideline adherence and resource utilization was evaluated during the 12-month period before and after implementation. Fourteen physician groups with 120 primary care physician and associate practitioners from 2 group model HMO practices. The patient education component included written and videotaped materials on the care of low back pain. The patient education intervention produced no significant change in guideline-consistent behavior, but was poorly adopted.</s><s>To determine the effect of continuing medical education (CME) with and without a quality assurance component (CME+QA) on physician practices in the prevention of venous thromboembolism. A communitywide study was performed in 15 short-stay hospitals in central Massachusetts. Study hospitals were randomly assigned to one of two educational strategies or to a control group that received no intervention. The increase in prophylaxis use from 1986 to 1989 was significantly greater among patients cared for in hospitals whose physicians participated in a formal CME program (an increase of 28%) than in control hospitals (an increase of 11%) (P < .001). A formal CME program significantly increased the frequency with which physicians prescribed prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism. Despite the substantial investment by hospitals in QA, traditional QA intervention appeared to provide no additional benefit. Even after extensive CME/QA interventions, prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism remained underutilized, suggesting the need to develop new approaches to changing clinical practice.</s><s>Although absolute risk of death associated with raised blood pressure increases with age, the benefits of treatment are greater in older patients. However, fewer patients in this group are identified, treated, and controlled. To evaluate the impact of the provision of different levels of feedback on identification, treatment, and control of older patients with hypertension. Electronic data were extracted from practice computer systems annually from 1999 to 2001 and used to develop feedback. Initially, more than 80% of patients in each group were treated but many were uncontrolled (blood pressure >/=160/ >/=90 mmHg) (control = 41.5%; audit = 41.3%; risk = 36.1%).</s><s>The rapid increase of antibiotic resistance poses a significant threat to human health. This study assessed the utility of two common interventions--1) practice profiling and feedback and 2) patient education materials--implemented to decrease antibiotic prescribing for pediatric upper respiratory infections (URIs). Based on Medicaid regions in Kentucky, primary care physicians managing pediatric respiratory infections in Medicaid were randomized into four groups. Participating physicians had their antibiotic prescribing assessed for the period of July 1, 1996, to November 30, 1997, with an intervention in June 1997. Antibiotic prescribing for viral respiratory infections continues to increase, suggesting concomitant increases in antibiotic resistance.</s><s>Immunizations and other cost-effective preventive services remain underused by many children, especially those living in poverty. Given the effectiveness of provider-based tracking systems and the widespread use by managed care organizations of financial incentives to influence physician practice patterns, we designed and tested an intervention combining these strategies. We studied whether a system of semiannual assessment and feedback, coupled with financial incentives, could improve pediatric preventive care in a Medicaid health maintenance organization (HMO). Feedback to physicians, with or without financial incentives, did not improve pediatric preventive care in this Medicaid HMO during a time of rapid, secular improvements in care. Possible explanations include the context and timing of the intervention, the magnitude of the financial incentives, and lack of physician awareness of the intervention.</s><s>A randomized controlled trial evaluated the impact of feedback and financial incentives on physician compliance with cancer screening guidelines for women 50 years of age and older in a Medicaid health maintenance organization (HMO). Mammography, breast exam, colorectal screening, and Pap testing compliance rates were evaluated.</s><s>Laboratory investigations are inappropriately utilized in the Pediatric OPD of Ramathibodi Hospital and this is due to lack of knowledge and unawareness of the cost of tests. 2) To evaluate the appropriateness of the residents' test ordering behavior. Randomized controlled trial carried out from January 1987 to May 1988, consisting of pre-intervention period (Jan-May 1987). For the residents, education on diagnostic tests, chart audit and feedback on their test ordering behavior were provided twice a week. The second year residents also played an active role in giving comments on the first year residents' performances. The simulated cases derived from the actual medical records serviced by the residents were reviewed and rated, according to the appropriateness of the residents' test ordering behavior, from 0 (poor) to 10 (excellent). 2) The achievement of a score indicating appropriate test ordering behavior of the resident groups. There was inappropriate laboratory utilization in this group of residents: overutilization defined as should not be ordered (26.9%), and underutilization defined as should have been ordered (17.7%). Most of the inappropriateness occurred in the ordering of microbiology (50%) and special blood chemistry (40%). The cost of tests per patient ordered by the R2C group was significantly increased as compared to their baseline. This suggested that the strategy prevented the inappropriateness of test ordering behavior. With the intervention, the overutilization significantly decreased while the underutilization increased.</s><s>Improvement in the delivery of influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations to high-risk groups is an important aspect of preventive care for primary healthcare teams. All practices measured influenza and pneumococcal vaccination rates in high-risk groups. Improvements in pneumococcal vaccination rates in the intervention practices were significantly greater compared with controls in patients with CHD, 14.8% versus 6.5% (odds ratio [OR] = 1.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.13 to 1.34) and diabetes, 15.5% versus 6.8% (OR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.08 to 1.29) but not splenectomy, 6.5% versus 4.7% (OR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.65 to 1.42). Improvements for influenza vaccination were also usually greater in intervention practices but did not reach statistical significance. Practices where primary care teams received an educational outreach visit demonstrated a significantly greater improvement in uptake in high-risk groups for pneumococcal but not influenza vaccine.</s><s>Great emphasis is placed on the need to base assistance activities on efficacy evidence. Implementation was investigated for protocols regarding the prevention of pressure lesions and the management of peripheral and central venous catheters. For both protocols, a checklist with the indicators needed for the evaluation was created. For almost all indicators, the data show an increment in the adoption of correct practices. Nevertheless, the last investigation shows a significant (P < 0.05) difference between the two groups in favour of the experimental group: 12 process indicators versus one for catheter management protocol and seven versus one for protocol on pressure lesions. The audit intervention allowed to highlight some more subjective criticalities important in determining the success or failure of the implementation of effective practices.</s><s>We wanted to evaluate the added value of small peer-group quality improvement meetings compared with simple feedback as a strategy to improve test-ordering behavior. We enrolled 194 primary care physicians from 27 local primary care practice groups in 5 health care regions (5 diagnostic centers). The study was a cluster randomized trial with randomization at the local physician group level. The mean number of tests per physician per 6 months at baseline and the physicians' region were used as independent variables, and the mean number of tests per physician per 6 months was the dependent variable. The new strategy was executed in 13 primary care groups, whereas 14 groups received feedback only. Five tests considered to be inappropriate for the clinical problem of upper abdominal complaints decreased in the intervention arm, with physicians in the feedback arm ordering 13 more tests per 6 months (P = .002). To be effective, feedback needs to be integrated in an interactive, educational environment.</s><s>Numbers of diagnostic tests ordered by primary care physicians are growing and many of these tests seem to be unnecessary according to established, evidence-based guidelines. An innovative strategy that focused on clinical problems and associated tests was developed. Multicenter, randomized controlled trial with a balanced, incomplete block design and randomization at group level. Primary care physician groups in 5 regions in the Netherlands with diagnostic centers recruited from May to September 1998. Twenty-six primary care physician groups, including 174 primary care physicians. According to existing national, evidence-based guidelines, a decrease in the total numbers of tests ordered per clinical problem, and of some defined inappropriate tests, is considered a quality improvement. For clinical problems allocated to arm B, the mean total number of requested tests per 6 months per physician was reduced from baseline to follow-up by 8% among physicians in the arm B intervention, and by 3% in the arm A control, with a mean reduction of 28 more tests per physician per 6 months in arm B than in arm A (P =.22).</s><s>Feedback can be described as a way to provide information on doctors' performance to enable changes in future behaviour. It is not sufficiently clear, however, whether feedback leads to more appropriate test use. One group of family doctors (n = 39) received feedback on test-group A (electrocardiography, endoscopy, cervical smears, and allergy tests), the other (n = 40) on test-group B (radiographic and ultrasonographic tests).</s><s>The effect of computerized feedback coupled with a newsletter upon outpatient prescribing charges. A randomized controlled trial.</s><s>We performed a randomized, prospective study to evaluate the use of a written feedback system in reducing the intraoperative costs of drugs and supplies used by anesthesiologists. Over 6 mo, 27 anesthesiology residents were randomized to feedback and control groups for their rotations in neurosurgical anesthesia. We recorded the cost of drugs and supplies for three procedures: carotid endarterectomy, lumbar decompression, and cervical decompression. The source of savings included lower use rates for propofol and etomidate and for patient warming devices. Analysis of data from recovery areas revealed a trend toward lower patient temperature in lumbar procedures performed by the feedback group.</s><s>A rigorous evaluation of continuous quality improvement (CQI) in medical practice has not been carried out on a national scale. Three hundred fifty-nine academic and nonacademic hospitals (treating 267 917 patients using CABG surgery) participating in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons National Cardiac Database between January 2000 and July 2002 were randomized to a control arm or to 1 of 2 groups that used CQI interventions designed to increase use of the process-of-care measures. Use of IMA grafting also tended to increase at IMA intervention sites (8.7% [SD, 17.5%]) vs control sites (5.4% [SD,15.8%]) (P =.20 and P =.11 for preintervention/postintervention and hierarchical analyses, respectively). Both interventions tended to have more impact at lower-volume CABG sites (for interaction: P =.04 for beta-blockade; P =.02 for IMA grafting). A multifaceted, physician-led, low-intensity CQI effort can improve the adoption of care processes into national practice within the context of a medical specialty society infrastructure.</s><s>Pharmaceuticals account for a significant portion of health care costs and are an important target for attempts at cost reductions. While many techniques have been shown effective, most are resource-intensive, have demonstrated fatigue after the intervention is ceased, and have been directed at specific items rather than total charges. The authors designed a computerized program to feed back prescription charges. The goal was to reduce total prescribing charges and produce a meaningful financial result. The low cost of the intervention yielded a benefit-to-cost ratio in excess of 50:1.</s><s>In a randomized controlled trial three methods of feedback of increasing intensity, directed at 183 doctors taking cervical smears, were compared with respect to their effects on the sampling quality of smears. Overall, feedback was found to have no influence on quality criteria in the crude data analysis. However, a significantly larger decrease in the percentage of smears lacking endocervical cells was found in the groups receiving monthly overviews of their results with peer comparison, when compared with the groups not receiving this type of feedback (odds ratio 0.75). A positive correlation was also observed between the increase in the group mean of the proportions of smears containing pathological cells and the intensity of the feedback.</s><s>Interventions to promote prescribing of preventive therapies in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) or diabetes have reported variable success. (i) To evaluate the effect of prescribing feedback on GP practice using academic detailing compared to postal bulletin on prescribing of CVD preventive therapies in patients with CVD or diabetes at 3 and 6 months post intervention and (ii) to evaluate the intervention from a GP's perspective. Statin and antiplatelet/warfarin prescribing also increased in the diabetic population; there was no significant differences between the groups. GPs participating in the project expressed a high level of satisfaction with both interventions.</s><s>This study tests whether an outreach educational program tailored to institutional specific patient care practices would improve the quality of care delivered to mechanically ventilated intensive care unit (ICU) patients in rural hospitals. Twelve randomly selected hospitals received an outreach educational program. After review of the medical records of eligible patients, a multidisciplinary team of intensive care unit specialists from an academic medical center delivered an educational program with content specific to the findings and capacity of the hospital. Results indicated that the outreach program significantly improved many patient care processes (lab work, nursing, dietary management, ventilator management, ventilator weaning). Both total length of stay and ICU length of stay fell markedly in the intervention group (by an average of 3.2 and 2.1 d, respectively), while the control group fell only 0.6 and 0.3 d, respectively. However, improving processes of care may not always translate into improvement of specific outcomes.</s><s>To assess the effectiveness of internal initiatives to improve quality as compared with external feedback, and as compared with a control group. Ten primary health centres were randomly selected from the centres in the Murcia's Region and were randomly assigned into three groups: G1 committed themselves to the improvement; G2 composed by two subgroups: with and without quality improvement (QI) activities - received external feedback; G3 received no intervention. Effect was assessed comparing criteria compliance and the cost of treatments for common cold in the three groups. G1 and G2 subgroup with internal QI improved significantly in all criteria, and in G1 average treatment cost decreased by 60% (P < 0.01). Internally assumed QI activities were significantly more effective than external feedback.</s><s>The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of academic detailing (AD) plus postal prescribing feedback versus postal prescribing feedback alone in reducing: (i) the overall rate of antibiotic; and (ii) proportion of second-line antibiotic prescribing. In addition, the cost-effectiveness of an outreach prescriber adviser service versus a postal prescribing feedback service was evaluated. Volunteer general practitioner practices (n = 98) were randomized to receive prescribing feedback via postal bulletin (PB) (n = 50) or academic detailing plus postal bulletin (AD) (n = 48). Regression (beta) coefficients, indicating proportion change in prescribing per month, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are presented. Prescribing feedback significantly reduced overall and second-line antibiotic prescribing, but academic detailing was not significantly more effective than postal bulletin in changing antibiotic prescribing practice.</s><s>In light of widespread undertreatment for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP), we designed a group randomized controlled trial to increase bone mineral density (BMD) testing and osteoporosis medication prescribing among patients receiving long-term glucocorticoid therapy. Intervention modules focused on GIOP management and incorporated case-based continuing medical education and personalized audit and feedback of GIOP management compared with that of the top 10% of study physicians. In the year following the intervention, we compared rates of BMD testing and osteoporosis medication prescribing between intervention and control physicians. Among 45 physicians completing all modules (343 patients), intervention physicians had numerically but not significantly higher rates of BMD testing (26% vs 16%, P =.04; rate difference, 10%; 95% CI, 1%-20%) and bisphosphonate prescribing (24% vs 17%, P =.09; rate difference, 7%; 95% CI, -1% to 16%) or met a combined end point of BMD testing or osteoporosis medication prescribing (54% vs 44%, P =.07; rate difference, 10%; 95% CI, -1% to 21%) compared with control physicians. However, dose-response trends showed that physicians with greater exposure to the intervention had higher rates of GIOP management. New cost-effective modalities are needed to improve the quality of osteoporosis care.</s><s>To determine whether audit/feedback and educational materials improve adherence to recommendations for laboratory monitoring and cytoprotective agents to detect and prevent adverse events caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs). Medical records were examined 10 months before and after the intervention for clinical data and receipt of complete blood count (CBC), creatinine testing, and cytoprotective agents (process measures). Of 101 physicians initially randomized, 85 remained eligible (38 internists, 36 family physicians, 11 rheumatologists) postintervention. Audit/feedback and educational materials had no observed effect on improving NSAID-related safety practices.</s><s>The purpose of this study was to examine the effects on immunization coverage of 3 incentives for physicians--a cash bonus for practice--wide increases, enhanced fee for service, and feedback. Incentives were applied at 4-month intervals over 1 year among 60 inner-city office-based pediatricians. Levels of missed opportunities to immunize were high in all groups and did not change over time. Bonuses sharply and rapidly increased immunization cover-age in medical records.</s><s>The extent of use of antibiotics to treat upper respiratory infections in general practice is an area for concern due to the increasing problem of bacterial resistance. Effective educational strategies to promote rational prescribing are needed. We aimed to examine the effectiveness of prescriber feedback and management guidelines in reducing antibiotics prescribing by GP trainees for undifferentiated upper respiratory tract infection, and in improving the choice of antibiotic for tonsillitis/streptococcal pharyngitis. The research tested a stepwise approach to targeting educational input to high prescribers. Trainees completed three practice activity surveys, each of 110 consecutive patient encounters, with 6-month intervals between surveys. Prescribing in agreement with accepted guidelines for tonsillitis/streptococcal pharyngitis increased over time in the intervention group from 55.6 to 69.8 to 73.0 per 100 problems, but decreased in the control group from 59.6 to 57.5 to 58.5 (P = 0.05). This study provides a model for targeting educational input to those prescribers who most need to change their behaviour.</s><s>To evaluate the effects of feedback reports combined with outreach visits from trained non-physicians on the clinical decision making of general practitioners (GPs) in cardiovascular care. Compliance rates for 12 evidence-based indicators for the management of patients with hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, angina pectoris, or heart failure. The evaluation relied on the prospective recording of patient encounters by the participating GPs. Single handed practices, non-training practices, and practices with older GPs gained particular benefit from the intervention. Intensive support from trained non-physicians can alter certain aspects of the clinical decision making of GPs in cardiovascular care.</s><s>To evaluate the effectiveness of a multifaceted intervention to improve the clinical decision making of general practitioners (GPs) for patients with diabetes. Cluster randomized controlled trial with 124 practices and 185 GPs in The Netherlands. The intervention group received feedback reports and support from a facilitator; the control group received no special attention. The intervention resulted in statistically significant improvement for two of the seven outcome measures: foot examination (odds ratio 1.68; 95% confidence interval 1.19-2.39) and eye examination (1.52; 1.07-2.16). Alternative interventions should be explored to improve the pursuit of metabolic control by GPs.</s><s>We undertook a study to assess the impact of comparative feedback vs general reminders on practice-based referrals to a tobacco cessation quit line and estimated costs for projected quit responses. We conducted a group-randomized clinical trial comparing the impact of 6 quarterly (18 months) feedback reports (intervention) with that of general reminders (control) on practice-based clinician referrals to a quit-line service. After 18 months, there were more referrals from the intervention than from the control practices (484 vs 220; P <.001). Practice facsimile (fax) referrals (84%, n = 595) exceeded telephone referrals (16%, n = 109), but telephone referrals resulted in greater likelihood of enrollment (77% telephone vs 44% fax, P <.001). Providing comparative feedback on clinician referrals to a quit-line service had a modest impact with limited increased costs.</s><s>The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of 2 feedback strategies on the adherence to congestive heart failure (CHF) guidelines. Thirty-two hospitals in 4 states were randomized to receive either a written feedback intervention (low-intensity intervention [LII]) or an intervention involving feedback, a physician liaison, and quality improvement tools (high-intensity intervention [HII]). Seventy-eight percent of quality managers indicated that hospital project implementation had not begun until shortly before remeasurement. Evaluation of the effects of external feedback on practice behavior requires sufficient time for organizational and individual clinician change to occur.</s><s>A multistate randomized study conducted under the Health Care Financing Administration's (HCFA's) Health Care Quality Improvement Program (HCQIP) offered the opportunity to compare the effect of a written feedback intervention (WFI) with that of an enhanced feedback intervention (EFI) on improving the anticoagulant management of Medicare beneficiaries who present to the hospital with venous thromboembolic disease. Twenty-nine hospitals in five states were randomly assigned to receive written hospital-specific feedback (WFI) of feedback enhanced by the participation of a trained physician, quality improvement tools, and an Anticoagulant Management of Venous Thrombosis (AMVT) project liaison (EFI). Quality managers were interviewed to determine perceptions of project implementation. No significant differences in the change from baseline to remeasurement were found between the two intervention groups. Significant improvement in one indicator and significant decline in two indicators were found for one or both groups. Yet 59% of all quality managers perceived the AMVT project as being successful to very successful, and more EFI quality managers perceived success than did WFI managers (71% versus 40%).</s><s>Research on synergistic effects of patient targeted interventions combined with physician-targeted interventions has been limited. Physicians in all clinics received diabetes-related quality performance feedback during staff meetings. At 1 year follow-up, outcome measurements included hemoglobin A1c, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol and systolic blood pressure: namely, the proportion of patients with HbA1c 9%, LDL <130 mg/dl and SBP <140 mmHg both as separate outcomes and combined. Compared to physician-feedback alone, a dual intervention combining a patient letter with physician feedback produced modest improvements in glycemic, lipid and blood pressure control individually, but substantial improvement in a combined measure of these three outcomes together. Using composite outcomes may detect meaningful improvements in the management of complex chronic disease.</s><s>Research is needed to validate effective and practical strategies for improving the provision of evidence-based medicine in primary care. 20 community-based family or general internal medicine practices in 14 states. 44 physicians, 17 midlevel providers, and approximately 200 staff members; data from the electronic medical records of 87,291 patients. The percentage of indicators at or above predefined targets and the percentage of patients who had achieved each clinical indicator. Intervention practices improved 22.4 percentage points (from 11.3% to 33.7%) in the percentage of indicators at or above the target; control practices improved 16.4 percentage points (from 6.3% to 22.7%). The 6.0-percentage point absolute difference between the intervention and control group was not statistically significant (P > 0.2). Primary care practices that use electronic medical records and receive regular performance reports can improve their adherence to clinical practice guidelines for cardiovascular disease and stroke prevention.</s><s>To evaluate an innovative approach to continuing medical education, an outreach intervention designed to improve performance rates of breast cancer screening through implementation of office systems in community primary care practices. Randomized, controlled trial with primary care practices assigned to either the intervention group or control group, with the practice as the unit of analysis. Cross-sectional reviews of randomly chosen medical records of eligible women patients aged 50 years and over were done at baseline (n = 2,887) and follow-up (n = 2,874) to determine whether clinical breast examinations and mammography, were performed. Results for mammography were recorded in two ways, mention of the test in the visit note and actual report of the test in the medical record. These reviews showed an increase from 39% to 51% in mention of mammography in intervention practices, compared with an increase from 41% to 44% in control practices (p = .01). At follow-up, few practices had a complete office system for breast cancer screening. Outreach approaches to assist primary care practices implement office systems are promising but need further development.</s><s>Does cost information availability reduce physician test usage? A randomized clinical trial with unexpected findings.</s><s>To assess the effects of feedback of patients' evaluations of care to general practitioners. 55 GPs and samples of 3691 and 3595 adult patients before and after the intervention, respectively. Patients' evaluations of nine dimensions of general practice measured with the CEP, a previously validated questionnaire consisting of 64 questions, using a six point answering scale (1= poor, 6 = very good). This conclusion challenges the relevance of feedback on patients' evaluations of care for quality improvement.</s><s>This study tested the effectiveness of two conceptually different chart audit-based approaches to modifying physicians' clinical practices to conform with quality-assurance standards. Using a clinical trial study design, 29 internal medicine interns were randomly assigned to four intervention groups identified by the intervention they received: control, reminder checklists (checklists), patient-specific feedback (feedback), or both interventions (combined). During both a baseline and subsequent intervention period, interns documented significantly more cholesterol management for inpatients with coronary artery disease (CAD) than without CAD. During baseline, 27.3%, 24.3%, 21.7%, 12.4%, 5.4%, and 2.7% of all inpatient charts had intern documentation concerning a low-fat hospital diet, cholesterol history, screening blood cholesterol level assessment, follow-up lipid profile, nutritionist consult, and preventive cardiology consult, respectively. The checklists significantly decreased overall intern-documented cholesterol management.</s><s>A randomized controlled trial with 76 physicians in 16 community hospitals evaluated audit and feedback and local opinion leader education as methods of encouraging compliance with a guideline for the management of women with a previous cesarean section. The guideline recommended clinical actions to increase trial of labor and vaginal birth rates. Duration of hospital stay was lower in the opinion leader education group than in the other two groups.</s><s>To assess the appropriateness of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions and the effectiveness of an intervention to reduce inappropriate RBC transfusions. Medical record audit by hospital staff using a data form, before and after randomly allocated interventions (letter only or letter+visit). Small reductions in inappropriate transfusions were found at the second audit, but the change was significant only for the hospitals receiving the letter-only intervention. More RBC transfusions were inappropriate in surgical patients than in those treated by other specialties.</s><s>To develop a working model with which prescribing behaviour among general practitioners might be influenced. The pharmacotherapeutic fields chosen were hypertension, peptic ulcer/dyspepsia and depression. Six health care centres and three continuing medical education groups in Stockholm. In the hypertension field, desired trends in fractional prescribing (favouring diuretics and beta blocking agents) were recorded, with a significant (P < 0.05) effect on prescriptions for agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, despite a pre-existing prescribing behaviour already much in line with the goals. The fractional prescribing rates for proton-pump inhibitors decreased from 61.0% to 52.6% in the intervention arm and increased from 68.1% to 76.0% in the control arm (not significant due to low power). The depression group focused on better general attention to the disease and only minor changes were registered.</s><s>This 1-year randomized trial tested the efficacy of behavioral techniques for increasing mammography referrals by primary care physicians in small, community practices. Quarterly chart audits of a defined sample (N = 11,716) of women patients 50 years of age or older were conducted to document mammography referrals, completions, and compliance. Referral and completion rates increased from baseline to first quarter and gradually declined thereafter. Overall, these rates were higher in the cuing conditions than in the control condition. In contrast, compliance rates in both experimental conditions increased over the year while remaining static in the control condition, demonstrating a strong and continuing effect for cue enhancement.</s><s>Quality assurance is required of all hospital outpatient clinics although there is little evidence documenting its value. Residents in one group audited their own charts for 1985 influenza vaccination ordering; the second group audited its own charts for 1985 screening mammography ordering; and the third group performed no audit but received the other groups' results. Actual performance of audits improved ordering of mammography from 16% to 26% but did not improve vaccination ordering. These quality assurance audits were effective in improving the performance of selected preventive health measures in a residents' clinic.</s><s>Performance feedback and benchmarking, common tools for health care improvement, are rarely studied in randomized trials. To evaluate the effectiveness of using achievable benchmarks to enhance typical physician performance feedback and improve care. Group-randomized controlled trial conducted in December 1996, with follow-up through 1998. Odds ratios (ORs) for patients of achievable benchmark physicians vs comparison physicians who received appropriate care after the intervention, adjusted for preintervention care and nesting of patients within physicians, were 1.57 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-1.96) for influenza vaccination, 1.33 (95% CI, 1.05-1.69) for foot examination, and 1.33 (95% CI, 1.04-1.69) for long-term glucose control measurement. Use of achievable benchmarks significantly enhances the effectiveness of physician performance feedback in the setting of a multimodal quality improvement intervention.</s><s>Our professional development plan aimed to improve the primary care management of acute asthma, which is known to be suboptimal. Consenting practices were randomised to early and delayed intervention groups. Primary outcome measure was recording of peak flow compared to best/predicted at 6 months. Six early intervention practices withdraw before completing the baseline audit. We demonstrated no significant benefit at the a priori 6-month assessment point, though improvement in the objective assessment of attacks was shown after 12 months. Monitoring of the assessment of acute attacks proved to be a feasible and responsive indicator of quality care.</s><s>We studied whether a hospital intervention utilizing medical opinion leaders and performance feedback reduced the proportion of women who reported that surgeons did not discuss options prior to surgery for early stage breast cancer. Performance feedback involved distributing performance reports that contained data on the outcomes of interest as well as on other treatment patterns. Twenty-eight hospitals in Minnesota were randomized to the intervention or to a control group that received performance feedback only.</s><s>More specifically, short-acting beta 2-agonists are overused, while inhaled corticosteroids are underused. This can be related in part to poor adherence by patients to the prescribed regimen and to professionals' failure to comply with practice guidelines. Feedback seems to have an effect on professional practices related to medication use. A sample of voluntary physicians and pharmacists was randomly assigned to either the experimental group or to the control group. Each mailing also included a pamphlet that summarized practice guidelines on asthma treatment. Physicians who received the feedback letters did not differ from those in the control group in terms of their proportion of prescriptions compliant with the criteria, either before the feedback or after it (p > 0.05). However, feedback to pharmacists is promising, especially when including patients' names so that pharmacists can intervene more specifically.</s><s>To assess the effectiveness of a multifaceted intervention to improve the management of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP). Of 21 rheumatologists, 11 were randomly assigned to a 3-part intervention consisting of a lecture and discussion regarding optimal management of GIOP, a confidential doctor-specific audit regarding management of GIOP, and a reminder mailing including concise pharmacologic recommendations. Medical records were assessed to determine the proportion undergoing bone mineral density testing or receiving pharmacologic interventions for GIOP during the 6 months before and 6 months after the intervention. After the intervention and a 6-month followup period, there were no differences in treatment (intervention 33% versus control 38%) or bone densitometry use (intervention 8% versus control 8%). Adjusting for patient and physician characteristics did not significantly change these results.</s><s>The Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) have produced regularly updated guidelines on radiological referrals since 1990. However there have been no randomized trials of the longer term effects of radiological guidelines and feedback on referral rates on X-ray requests from primary care. To see if the introduction of radiological guidelines into general practices together with feedback on referral rates reduces the number of GP radiological requests over one year; and to explore GPs'attitudes to the guidelines. In February 1995 a GP version of the RCR guidelines was sent to each GP in the 33 practices in the intervention group. After 9 months intervention, practices were sent revised guidelines with individual feedback on the number of examinations requested in the past 6 months. A total of 43 778 radiological requests were made during the two years 1994-1996.</s><s>To evaluate the effect on general practitioners' prescribing of feedback on their levels of prescribing. 2440 full time recognised general practitioners practising in non-urban areas. Two sets of graphical displays (6 months apart) of their prescribing rates for 2 years, relative to those of their peers, were posted to participants. Data were provided for five main drug groups and were accompanied by educational newsletters. The intervention and control groups had similar baseline characteristics (age, sex, patient mix, practices). There was no evidence that feedback reduced the variability in prescribing nor did it differentially affect the very high or very low prescribers.</s><s>The hypothesis that general practitioners would obtain better outcomes for patients with hypertension using a computer than doctors not using a computer was tested. \"Test\" physicians completed a data collection form after each visit from a patient with hypertension and mailed the forms to the test centre for processing. Physicians who used the computer saw more patients per practice than control doctors (test 50 patients, control 40). For all patients the length of follow up was significantly longer in test practices (test 199 days, control 167), and a smaller percentage dropped out of active treatment in test practices (test 37.5%, control 42.1%). For patients with \"moderate\" hypertension of a baseline diastolic pressure of greater than 104 mm Hg the mean score of the last recorded pressure was below the goal of 90 mm Hg in test practices (88.5 mm Hg), but it failed to reach this goal in control practices (93.3 mm Hg).</s><s>This study evaluated the effects of an intervention on rates of skin cancer prevention counseling by pharmacists. Fifty-four pharmacies were randomly assigned to intervention or control conditions. Counseling rates before and after the intervention were obtained from study confederates. At pretest, the proportions of control and intervention sites providing counseling at least once were 7.4% and 0%, respectively (NS).</s><s>To evaluate the feasibility and implementation needs of a cholesterol guideline by assessing the effectiveness of simple dissemination as well as extensive implementation of this guideline on actual performance of general practitioners (GPs). Guideline dissemination to all 32 GPs, and a 5-month programme for improvement in the intervention group. The outcome parameters were defined as quality of selective case finding and quality of diagnostic procedures, and were measured by chart audit. The quality of selective case finding, especially the targeting of cholesterol testing to those with positive cardiovascular risk profiles, did not improve following intervention. Neither simple dissemination nor an intensive programme for improvement had measurable impact on actual performance on working according to the cholesterol guideline.</s><s>Although clinical trials have shown that proper management of diabetes can improve outcomes, and treatment guidelines are widespread, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels in the United States are rising. When glucose levels exceeded 150 mg/dL (8.33 mmol/L) during visits of 4038 patients, health care provider behavior was characterized as did nothing, did anything (any intensification of therapy), or did enough (if intensification met recommendations). During the trial, intensification increased most during the first year and then declined. After 3 years, health care provider behavior in the reminders alone and control groups returned to baseline, whereas improvement with feedback alone and feedback plus reminders groups was sustained: 52% did anything, and 30% did enough (P<.001 for both vs the reminders alone and control groups). Feedback on performance given to medical resident primary care providers improved provider behavior and lowered HbA1c levels. Similar approaches may aid health care provider behavior and improve diabetes outcomes in other primary care settings.</s><s>To measure the impact of a population-based tracking system on influenza immunization rates. Thirteen practices with 45 physicians were randomized to a control and two intervention groups. All patients aged 65 years and over who were seen in participating physicians' practices within the preceding two years. A population-based strategy that monitors performance can significantly improve rates of influenza immunization in private practices.</s><s>A major problem with inappropriate use of antibiotics is the emergence of resistance. Thus, cost-effective interventional strategies are required to improve their use. Twenty health centers were randomly assigned to receive: (1) no intervention; (2) audit and feedback; (3) audit and feedback + seminar; or (4) audit and feedback + academic detailing. A total of 1,800 patient encounters, 30 from each health center, were randomly collected. In comparison to the control group, the prescriber targeted interventions involving audit and feedback, together with academic detailing (4), reduced the mean number of encounters with an antibiotic prescribed by 6.3 and 7.7 (p<0.001) at 1 and 3 months post-intervention, respectively. Multifaceted interventions involving audit and feedback combined with either academic detailing or seminars appear more effective in changing prescribing practices of antibiotics than audit and feedback alone.</s><s>In an academic general medicine clinic, we performed a randomized, controlled trial to compare (1) the effects of supplying monthly feedback reports of compliance with preventive care protocols by 135 internal medicine house staff with (2) the effects of specific reminders given to them at the time of patient visits. The protocols were randomly divided into two groups, A and B, and half the house staff were given feedback for Group A and half for Group B. There was also significantly more compliance with the same protocols by house staff receiving reminders, but the increase for fecal occult blood testing, pneumococcal vaccination, and combined Group A protocols was twice that seen in physicians given feedback alone. In addition, reminders alone increased compliance with oral calcium supplementation. Overall compliance with the preventive care protocols was low: 10-15% in physicians receiving neither feedback nor reminders, increasing to 15-30% in those receiving reminders.</s><s>Using a crossover design, it is shown that an individual criteria setting followed by immediate feedback of previous performance produced a sustained and continuing improvement in recording for two common conditions (cystitis and vaginitis).</s><s>To investigate the effectiveness of a quality improvement educational program in rural hospitals. The 47 hospitals were randomized either to receive formal quality improvement educational program or to a control group. No significant differences were observed between the study groups on any measures. Similar results were obtained when these groups were compared with the control group. While the observed results suggest no incremental benefit of the quality improvement educational program following implementation of a web-based benchmarking and case-review tool in rural hospitals, given the small number of hospitals that completed the program, it is not conclusive that such programs are ineffective.</s><s>To investigate the effect on immunization levels of retrospective written feedback to residents regarding missed immunization opportunities. Pediatric resident continuity clinic in an urban hospital-based primary care clinic. Monthly retrospective written feedback mailed to residents detailing their missed immunization opportunities and appointment failure rates over a 12-month period beginning in February 1997. Secondary outcomes included missed immunization opportunity rates and appointment failure rates. Postintervention immunization levels were 71.4% (95% confidence limits [CLs]: 63.2%, 78.7%) for patients from the intervention group and 68.5% (95% CLs: 60.8%, 75.4%) for patients from the control group. The immunization level for patients of both groups who had fewer than 2 visits during the second year of life was 47.2% (95% CLs: 38.2%, 56.3%).</s><s>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of clinical direct reports (practice data with pertinent evidence from the literature) on dialysis modality selection for patients with end-stage renal disease. A randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted at five dialysis centers. The number of patients allocated to peritoneal dialysis was significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group (15.3% versus 2.4%; P = 0.044).</s><s>Nurses with advanced training-diabetes resource nurses (DRNs)-can improve care for people with diabetes in capitated payment settings. Each practice was randomized to one of three intervention groups: physician feedback on process measures using Medicare claims data; Medicare claims feedback plus feedback on clinical measures from medical record (MR) abstraction; or both types of feedback plus a practice-based DRN. Results were similar for the other clinical outcomes, with no differences significant at P = 0.10. For process of care measures, decreases were seen in all groups, with no significant differences in change scores. Quality improvement strategies must be evaluated in the appropriate setting.</s><s>The electronic health record (EHR) may be an effective tool to help clinicians address tobacco use more consistently. To evaluate the impact of EHR-generated practice feedback on rates of referral to a state-level tobacco quitline, we conducted a cluster randomized clinical trial (feedback versus no feedback) within 19 primary care clinics in Oregon. Intervention clinics received provider-specific monthly feedback reports generated from EHR data. The reports rated provider performance in asking, advising, assessing, and assisting with tobacco cessation compared with a clinic average and an achievable benchmark of care. A higher case-mix index and presence of a clinic champion were associated with higher rates of referral to a state-level quitline.</s><s>Education is an effective tool for modifying physician use of the laboratory. We compared two interventions by assigning 56 medical house officers into four groups: control group; feedback group, which received feedback concerning its use of tests; manual group, which received a manual concerning cost-effective laboratory use; and manual plus feedback group, which received both interventions. When we controlled for diagnosis, the manual plus feedback group had the most profound decrease (42%) in laboratory use, followed by the manual group.</s><s>Data for the Finnish medical birth register (established 1987) are collected by local hospital personnel as a part of their routine work. The purpose of this study was to study the need of personnel for feedback and the impact of feedback on later data quality. Opinions of the package were obtained by questionnaire from 104 physicians and nurses (82% response rate). Most hospital personnel, especially physicians, had negative attitudes towards the birth register. Comparison of the hospitals which had received feedback with other hospitals in terms of quality of data furnished in 1987 and 1988 suggested that feedback may improve the technical quality of data.</s><s>The capacity of educational programs to improve physician performance remains doubtful despite many evaluative efforts. This procedure may cause harm to the fetus, and there is little evidence that it is efficacious. We randomly assigned 120 hospitals in six Professional Standards Review Organizations to study and control groups. Physicians with delivery privileges at each study hospital participated in an educational program that discussed acceptable indications for x-ray pelvimetry. Pelvimetry use was similar in study and control hospitals before the program.</s><s>To determine if written feedback improves the chart documentation and knowledge of physicians doing evaluations for child sexual abuse and to learn what other factors are associated with better documentation and knowledge. All physicians who performed evaluations for sexual abuse during 1991 to 1992. The quality of documentation and physician knowledge before and after the intervention. The risk ratio for a mean overall history rating of excellent/good was 0.89 (0.63, 1.25) and for a mean overall physical examination rating of excellent/good was 1.03 (0.73, 1.45). A structured medical record, female physicians, and credits in continuing medical education were associated with better documentation. Tailored feedback to the physician with directed educational materials did not seem to improve most aspects of documentation and knowledge of child sexual abuse, although notable improvement was seen during the time period studied.</s><s>To determine the impact and cost-effectiveness of telephone versus written access to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and of different strategies for disseminating locally produced guidelines, upon requests by general practitioners (GPs) for knee and lumbar spine investigation. Two sequential pragmatic open cluster-randomized trials were conducted within 39 general practices. Trial 2: compared to the control group, costs per practice were pound1911 higher in seminar group, pound1543 higher in feedback group and pound3578 higher for those receiving both. Seminars and feedback were no more effective in modifying practice than guidelines alone, which was thus the most cost-effective option.</s><s>A randomised controlled trial of feedback to general practitioners of their prophylactic aspirin prescribing.</s><s>Effective physician involvement in quality assurance in hospitals is necessary both to identify problems in patient care and to bring about problem resolution. This report describes a controlled, longitudinal study designed to measure effects on physician performance of involving physicians in setting medical audit criteria, reviewing audit results, and receiving concurrent reminders on a case-by-case basis. During phase 2, 6 months later, the physicians in all three groups were exposed to 4 months of concurrent reminders. During phase 1, the group involved in review of audit results only achieved 51% compliance with the preset criteria compared with 26% for the group involved in criteria setting and review of audit results (P = 0.002).</s><s>A model for improving physician prescribing that utilizes computerized feedback was studied in a family medicine residency practice. Resident and faculty physicians were stratified by level of experience and randomized into two groups. For 9 months the experimental group received monthly printouts identifying drugs they had prescribed by brand name with estimates of cost savings that might have been realized by prescribing generic drugs. Prescription monitoring of both groups continued for 12 months after all feedback had ceased. Rates for the control physicians for the three periods were 32%, 37% and 31%, respectively.</s><s>The authors evaluated the effect of an educational and feedback intervention on H2-blocker prescribing patterns and determined, if such effects differed for network- versus group-model health maintenance organization (HMO) physicians and in academic versus nonacademic settings. Physicians were randomized to receive an educational memorandum alone or combined with feedback regarding their individual prescribing behavior. Prescribing was monitored during the 6 months before and after the intervention. There was no difference in prescribing change based on type of intervention (education versus feedback). The authors conclude that a simple passive educational intervention can be effective at changing group-model HMO physician behavior.</s><s>Effective therapies for reducing mortality rates in persons with coronary heart disease (CHD) remain underused. An intervention, consisting of a guideline summary, peer comparison performance feedback, and patient specific chart reminders was evaluated in a randomized, practice-based effectiveness trial. Data were available for >700 patients per year (1999-2002) in 131 practices. The use of all 3 types of medications increased steadily with time, with the exception of a decrease in the use of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors in the final year (2002). The observed pattern of care supports the contention that the quality of outpatient care for secondary prevention of CHD improved from 1999 to 2002 in this setting.</s>"

Disease activity was assessed on a clinical grading scale without knowledge of the treatment given. At the end of the treatment period, 22 of the 37 cyclosporine-treated patients (59 percent) had improvement, as compared with 11 of the 34 placebo-treated patients (32 percent) (P = 0.032).</s><s>This study aimed to delineate the long-term effect of cyclosporine in chronic active Crohn's disease. The low-activity group continued to receive the pretrial steroid dose for 2 months, and the high-activity group received 1 mg.kg-1.day-1 prednisone initially. The main parameter of efficacy was the CDAI, and the main end point was the number of patients in remission at month 12. During cyclosporine therapy, 35% (95% confidence interval [95% Cl], 25%-46%) of the patients achieved a full remission (CDAI, < 150) after 4 months compared with 27% (95% Cl, 18%-38%) in the placebo group (P > 0.05). No major differences between treatment groups were found within each of the two strata.</s><s>Long-term corticosteroid therapy for Crohn's disease is associated with important types of morbidity, such as osteoporosis. Adult patients whose disease had been active within the previous two years were randomly assigned to receive cyclosporine (151 patients) or placebo (154 patients) in addition to their usual therapy. Randomization was stratified according to center and score on the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (193 patients had scores of 150 or less, and 112 had scores greater than 150). Secondary outcomes were the use of prednisone and 5-amino-salicylates, mean score on the Crohn's Disease Activity Index and mean quality-of-life score, and the need for surgery. The condition of more patients worsened with cyclosporine than with placebo (91 of 151, or 60.3 percent, vs. 80 of 154, or 51.9 percent; P = 0.10). In our patient population, the addition of low-dose cyclosporine to conventional treatment for Crohn's disease did not improve symptoms or reduce requirements for other forms of therapy.</s>"

There were no differences in bleeding or other complications in the two groups.</s><s>A double-blind controlled clinical trial of the efficacy of the prophylactic subcutaneous administration of calcium heparin in preventing deep vein thrombosis has been conducted in 50 patients with a fractured neck of the femur. In the placebo group, 12 of 25 patients developed a deep venous thrombosis and in five of these patients the thrombosis propagated to the thigh.</s><s>A prospective randomized controlled study has been undertaken to evaluate two different prophylactic treatments against postoperative thromboembolic complications after hip surgery. Deep vein thrombosis was diagnosed in both groups with the 125I-fibrinogen test and pulmonary perfusion defects in the arthroplasty group with a combination of pulmonary X-ray and perfusion scintigraphy. The frequency of thrombosis was significantly higher in untreated hip fracture patients than in untreated arthroplasty patients. Only dextran reduced the frequency of major thrombosis and in the heparin group one fatal pulmonary embolism occurred. Two patients in the control group died of pulmonary embolism, but the frequency of pulmonary perfusion defects was not influenced by the treatment.</s><s>Low-dose heparin, dipyridamole (alone and in combination with aspirin), and flurbiprofen were evaluated as potential prophylactic agents against deep venous thrombosis in elderly patients with hip fractures. Low-dose heparin reduced the overall frequency of venous thrombosis and its extent as judged by the frequency of bilaterally abnormal scans, but this reduction did not achieve statistical significance.</s><s>A prospective, randomized clinical trial in 304 orthopaedic trauma patients with hip and pelvic fractures was conducted to investigated the effectiveness of pneumatic sequential leg compression devices (PSLCDs) for the prevention of thromboembolic disease. The incidence of a venous thromboembolic event in the control group was 11% and in the experimental group 4%. In the pelvic fracture group there was a thromboembolic incidence of 11% in the controls, demonstrating this patient population to be at significant risk.</s><s>In a prospective, randomized study in patients with hip fracture we discuss whether a single dose of low-molecular-heparin (Sandoparin) has the same effect as a tripple dose of standard-heparin (Liquemin: 3 x 5000 I.E.) The first dose of low-molecular-heparin respectively standard-heparin is given in the emergency room before the operation. 33 patients have been treated with standard-heparin and 35 with low-molecular-heparin. The LCCT and the ultrasound examination were compared with the phlebography. Therefore the ultrasound examination is an unsuitable screening method to detect deep vein thrombosis in patients with fractures of the proximal end of the femur.</s><s>One hundred and ten female patients, over the age of 60, with intertrochanteric or transcervical fractures were included in a controlled, randomized, clinical trial investigating the value of low dosage heparin in the prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis.

The incidence of proximal deep-vein thrombosis as assessed by Doppler ultrasonography was 23% in the control group and 0% in those using the device (p less than 0.01). Calf and thigh circumferences were measured in both groups at seven to ten days after operation.</s><s>In a randomized, prospective, double-blind trial, the effect of conventional low-dose heparin (5,000 units every 8 hours) was compared with that of a low molecular weight fragment (2165 LMWH, Kabi Vitrum AB, starting 2,500 units 2 hr before surgery, and then 5,000 units subcutaneously every morning for 9 days). In the first 57 patients studied a bilateral ascending venography was performed on the ninth day only if clinical symptoms suggested a deep venous thrombosis. Mortality did not differ between the groups, nor did haemorrhagic complications. Our findings suggest that, in patients with hip fracture, LMWH is not useful at the dosage used.</s><s>Efficacy and safety of a low molecular weight heparin (Alfa LMWH) was compared with unfractionated heparin (UFH) in the prevention of post-operative venous thromboembolism after hip fractures. Screening for thrombosis was performed with 125-I-fibrinogen leg scanning and strain-gauge plethysmography. Five patients in the Alfa LMWH group (20 per cent) developed venographycally proven deep vein thrombosis (DVT) versus seven (29 per cent) in the UFH group. Alfa LMWH appears to be a promising drug for prevention of venous thromboembolism after orthopaedic surgery.</s><s>Two hundred and thirty-eight patients with femoral neck fractures were entered into a randomised pilot study comparing the use of sequential treatment by 'Flowtron DVT' garments in the perioperative period followed by Enoxaparin (Clexane-Rhône-Poulenc Rorer), and Enoxaparin alone. The remaining 44 were randomised: 21 received Enoxaparin from the time of admission, and 23 had sequential treatment. Sequential treatment was not shown to be better or worse than treatment with Enoxaparin, but the trends favoured sequential treatment rather than drug treatment alone. The technique allows the operation to be carried out without the problems produced by low dose heparins and mobilisation is not hindered by compression garments.</s><s>Low-dose heparin in femoral neck fractures.</s><s>In a prospective, double-blind, controlled study, we compared the antithrombotic efficacy of low-dose heparin with dihydroergotamine (A), low-molecular-weight heparin with dihydroergotamine (B), and placebo (C). A and B proved to be equally safe but failed to provide any protection against deep-vein thrombosis, although B showed a tendency to reduce the incidence.</s><s>Sixty-seven hip-arthroplasty and fifty-two hip-fracture patients participated in a placebo-controlled randomized double-blind study on the effects of low-dose heparin prophylaxis in the prevention of venous thromboembolism. Heparin-treated arthroplasty patients required mean blood transfusions of 4.7 units, contrasted with a mean 3.2-unit transfusion requirement for placebo-treated patients (p less than 0.05). The incidence of observed bleeding complications was higher among the heparin-treated patients. Of the twenty-three placebo-treated patients with fracturs, 39.1 per cent had a thromboembolic event, while 41.4 per cent of the twenty-nine who received heparin showed evidence of thromboembolism, demonstrating that low-dose heparin afforded no protection, nor did it affect the incidence of bleeding complications or transfusion requirements in fracture patients.</s><s>Patients undergoing operations on the hip for either replacement or fracture were chosen for this study. Fifty-two subjects received cyclic sequential compression as well as elevation of the lower limb while another fifty-two patients were treated with only elevation of the lower limb. Doppler ultrasound, phleborheography, and, when possible, radioiodinated fibrinogen scanning were used for identification and location of thrombi.</s><s>A randomized double-blind study comparing the efficacy and safety of two different dosage regimens of a low-MW heparin, Enoxaparin (Lovenox) 20 mg twice (group A) or 40 mg once (group B), was carried out in 103 elderly patients with a fracture of the neck of the femur. No major hemorrhagic complication was observed, except for two hematomas in each group.</s><s>Seventy-eight patients of average age 78 years suffering from an unilateral non-pathological hip fracture underwent compression ultrasound and pulsed and colour Doppler examination of both legs. There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of DVT between the control and LMWH groups, and the incidence of DVT in elderly Chinese patients after hip replacement for a hip fracture is similar to that in other studies in Caucasians. There were, however, some differences, namely the contiguous nature of the thrombi rather than focal segmental clots, and the absence of propagation or tail formation. Although the numbers are small, this could possibly represent a population difference. There was a significantly increased occurrence of DVTs on the operated side in both groups.</s><s>A pilot study was performed to compare the thromboprophylactic effect of danaparoid, enoxaparin and dalteparin in patients with hip fracture. Prophylaxis was given for 9-11 days, whereafter bilateral phlebography was performed.</s><s>The effect of low doses of heparin (5000 units of sodium heparin every 12 hours for 10 days) and dihydroergotamine (DHE) (0.5 mg at the same intervals as heparin) on the incidence of deep-vein thrombosis (D.V.T.) developed in 15 patients in the heparin group, in 12 patients in heparin + DHE group and in 28 patients in the control group.</s><s>A randomized study of adjusted versus fixed low dose heparin prophylaxis has been conducted in 100 patients undergoing surgery for hip replacement or fractured neck of femur. Adjustment of dosage began 24 h after surgery in the replacement group and 24 h after admission in the fracture group. Significant improvement in protection against postoperative deep vein thrombosis, assessed by venography, was observed in the adjusted group undergoing hip replacement (P = 0.013) and overall in both groups (P = 0.017) compared with a conventional fixed dose subcutaneous regimen (calcium heparin 5000 units, 8-hourly).</s><s>The effect of heparin, 5000 units every 8 hours, on deep venous thrombosis in patients with proximal femoral fractures was investigated in a controlled, double blind, randomised study. Heparin or placebo was administered as soon as possible after the fracture, and before 6 hours had passed, and was continued for 14 days. This showed that the 0-hypothesis could not be rejected, and that consequently no difference in the frequency of deep-vein thrombosis was detected.</s><s>The value of low dosage heparin in preventing venous thromboembolism was studied in 150 patients with proximal femoral fractures. This was a prospective, randomized, clinical trial, consisting of 116 women and 34 men with a mean age of 73 years (38 to 92). There was significantly less D. V. T. in the heparinized group than in the control group (p < 0.01) and the incidence of P. E. was smaller in the heparinized group, 0 and 4 per cent respectively. We recommend routine use of low dosage heparin started on admission to hospital in proximal femoral fractures.</s>"

Clearance of serum hepatitis B virus-DNA and HBeAg (complete response) was achieved in 21% of group A, 5% of group B and none of group C at the end of therapy (A vs B: p = 0.054; A vs C: p < 0.01). Those with baseline alanine transaminase < or = 200 U/l showed a better response to interferon following prednisolone withdrawal (48%) than with interferon therapy alone (20%, p = 0.056) and no treatment (9%, p < 0.01). The strongest independent predictor of a response to treatment was prednisolone withdrawal (p < 0.05).</s><s>There is no generally accepted treatment for chronic hepatitis B (HB) infection in children. To evaluate the efficacy of a prolonged course of high dose interferon alone or after prednisone priming in children with chronic HB infection. By the end of the first year treatment induced a loss of HB virus DNA and HBeAg from serum in 10 of 21 patients (48%), and a loss of HB surface antigen (HBsAg) in 4 (19%). In controls only one patient lost HBeAg and HBV DNA (11%; P = 0.05), and none lost HBsAg or showed alanine aminotransferase normalization (P = 0.21 and 0.70, respectively).</s><s>Interferon is the most promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of chronic viral hepatitis. Overall, 10 patients (34.5%) cleared hepatitis Be antigen and 13 (44.8%) HBV-DNA. There was no statistically significant difference between the two treatment groups regarding response rate. Baseline transaminases levels and HBV-DNA concentrations were predictive parameters for HBeAg clearance.</s><s>The aim of this multicentre, randomised, controlled, clinical trial was to evaluate the effect of prednisolone followed by lymphoblastoid interferon treatment in chronic hepatitis B. Of 200 evaluable patients, 33 (16.5%) were females, and 50 (25%) were male homosexuals. Six months after stopping interferon, HBV DNA was negative in 51% of prednisolone patients vs. 28% of placebo patients (Chi-square test statistic 6.13; p = 0.013). Fifteen patients (7.5%) (13 within 1 year of follow-up) eventually lost HBsAg; 14 of these subsequently developed anti-HBs. Prednisolone pre-treatment significantly enhanced the treatment effect of lymphoblastoid interferon in terms of HBeAg clearance and seroconversion to anti-HBe. Treatment should be used with caution in patients with cirrhosis and avoided in patients showing signs, or with a history, of decompensated cirrhosis.</s><s>Chronic hepatitis B is a common and often progressive liver disorder for which there is no accepted therapy. The strongest independent predictor of a response to treatment was the amount of hepatitis B viral DNA in serum at entry (P less than 0.0001). In chronic hepatitis B, treatment with interferon alfa-2b (5 million units per day for 16 weeks) was effective in inducing a sustained loss of viral replication and achieving remission, assessed biochemically and histologically, in over a third of patients. Moreover, in about 10 percent of the patients treated with interferon, hepatitis B surface antigen disappeared from serum.</s><s>Ninety Chinese hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carrier children, aged 2-17 years, positive for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and hepatitis B virus DNA on at least three occasions in 6 months, were randomized into 3 groups. At 24 months of follow-up, persistent loss of hepatitis B virus DNA occurred in none of the children in the control group, in one child receiving recombinant alpha 2b-interferon alone, who also seroconverted to anti-HBe and anti-HBs and in five children receiving interferon with steroid priming (p = 0.0571 compared with controls), with four seroconverting to anti-HBe and one also seroconverting to anti-HBs. Side effects of the steroid were negligible; those of recombinant alpha 2b-interferon were transient and acceptable.</s><s>In a randomized, controlled trial of recombinant interferon alfa-2b with or without prednisone priming in Chinese adults with chronic hepatitis B virus infection, stratified randomization for pretreatment serum alanine aminotransferase levels was done. The response to interferon treatment was significantly better in those who had elevated pretreatment transaminase levels and comparable to that reported in white patients [15 (38.5%) of 39 patients compared with 2 (5%) of 40 who had normal pretreatment transaminase levels (P = 0.0005)]. However, the response was significantly better in patients with elevated transaminase levels.</s><s>Thirty-five children with chronic HBV infection, HBV-DNA and eAg serum positivity, and HBcAg in liver tissue were treated with lymphoblastoid human interferon alpha with (16 cases) or without (19 cases) prednisolone pretreatment. The response to either treatment did not correlate with the pretreatment serum transaminase. Interferon was well tolerated, the side effects being less severe than in adults, and never led to suspension of the treatment.</s><s>The comparative efficacy of prednisolone followed by interferon alfa (IFN-alpha) versus IFN-alpha alone in enhancing the rate of antibody to hepatitis B e antigen (anti-HBe) seroconversion has not been evaluated in a large cohort of white children. Baseline clinical, biochemical, and histological features were similar for the three groups. On follow-up between 12 and 18 months (median, 15 months) after treatment, the loss of HBeAg with anti-HBe seroconversion was more common in patients pretreated with steroids (12 of 34 [35 percent]) or placebo [12 of 30 (40 percent)] as against controls (4 of 31 [13 percent], P< .05). Factors predictive of anti-HBe seroconversion were baseline HBV-DNA concentration of < or = 1,000 pg/mL and a greater degree of portal tract inflammation on pretrial biopsy.</s><s>Fifty-six patients with biopsy-proven, chronic active hepatitis B were included in a multi-center, randomized trial comparing steroid withdrawal followed by 1.5 MU recombinant interferon alpha 2b (Intron) with placebo withdrawal followed by either 1.5 or 5 MU interferon. After 1 year of treatment, 10/18, 13/19 and 11/18 patients had lost hepatitis B virus DNA in the three groups, respectively (non-significant). Biopsy score improved in both groups but this reached statistical significance only in responders. Side effects included almost universally a flu-like syndrome, granulocytopenia (1), depression (3) and thyroid dysfunction (2). Two deaths occurred, one due to hepatocellular cancer, and the other to hepatorenal syndrome after spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.</s><s>This study was designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of high dose interferon, with or without prednisone pretreatment, in patients with chronic hepatitis B. Loss of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and hepatitis B virus (HBV)-DNA, with a return to normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity, was seen in 16 of 26 group I patients (61.5%), in one group II patient (4.2%) during the control phase, and in 13 of 23 group II patients (56.5%) after interferon. There were no statistically significant differences in response between groups I and II. Liver biopsies carried out in 20 patients showed that responders had a noticeable reduction in inflammation and disappearance of core antigen in liver tissue, changes not seen in non-responders.</s><s>The present study was aimed to test the efficacy and safety of interferon alpha (Wellferon-Wellcome Foundation Ltd.) either alone, or in combination with short-term corticosteroid pretreatment in the therapy of chronic hepatitis B. 30 patients had chronic active hepatitis on liver biopsy, while 14 had chronic persistent hepatitis. Interferon was given by intramuscular injection in a single daily dose of 10 x 10(6) IU for 5 days and three times weekly thereafter. However, because of side effects, the dose of interferon was occasionally reduced to 5 x 10(6) IU in most patients. The outcome of the treatment was unrelated to gender and pretreatment activity of transaminases, however, patients with low activity of HBV replication were more likely to respond to therapy than patients with high HBV replication.</s>"

Practices stratified by MCO and size were randomized to intervention or control groups. The intervention included 2 meetings of the practice with a physician peer leader, using CDC-endorsed summaries of judicious prescribing recommendations; feedback on previous prescribing rates were also provided. Automated enrollment, ambulatory visit, and pharmacy claims were used to determine rates of antibiotic courses dispensed (antibiotics/person-year) during baseline (1996-1997) and intervention (1997-1998) years. Among children 36 to <72 months old, the rate decreased by 0.21 antibiotics per person-year (15%) in intervention and 0.17 (9.8%) in control practices. Multivariate analysis showed an adjusted intervention effect of 16% in the younger and 12% in the older age groups.

Anxiety and insomnia diagnosis rates also declined from 4.68 to 3.76 per 100 encounters (19.7 per cent).

At the first a summary of the relevant evidence was provided and at the second detailed audit information was provided about fall rates, psychotropic drug prescribing and stroke risk reduction practices (BP monitoring, aspirin and warfarin use) for the facility relevant to the physician. The effect of the interventions was determined via pre- and post-intervention case note audit. Data were available from case notes at baseline (n = 897) and seven months follow-up (n = 902), 452 residential care staff were surveyed and 121 physicians were involved with 61 receiving outreach visits. There were no differences between the intervention and control groups for the three month fall rate. We were unable to detect statistically significant differences between groups for the psychotropic drug use of the patients before or after the intervention. There was no statistically significant difference between groups for the numbers of patients \"at risk of stroke\" on aspirin at follow-up.

The promotional campaign was designed to encourage a rational approach to prescribing of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents in an intervention group of 101 general practitioners selected at random from the Leeds Family Practitioner Committee (FPC). Prescribing of the second choice agent, piroxicam, decreased in the reference group but not in the intervention group. There was a decrease in the average prescribing cost of pounds 6.60 per doctor per month in the intervention group compared with the reference group.</s><s>Interventions designed to narrow the gap between research findings and clinical practice may be effective, but also costly. Economic evaluations are necessary to judge whether such interventions are worth the effort. We have evaluated the economic effects of a tailored intervention to support the implementation of guidelines for the use of antihypertensive and cholesterol-lowering drugs. The tailored intervention was evaluated in a randomized trial, and was shown to significantly increase the use of thiazides for patients started on antihypertensive medication, but had little or no impact on other outcomes. Only patients that were being started on antihypertensive medication were included in the analyses. A multifaceted intervention was tailored to address identified barriers to change. Key components were an educational outreach visit with audit and feedback, and computerized reminders. A cost-minimization framework was adopted, where the costs of intervention were set against the reduced treatment costs (principally due to increased use of thiazides rather than more expensive medication). The cost-effectiveness of the intervention was estimated as the cost per additional patient being started on thiazides. The cost per additional patient started on thiazides (cost-effectiveness) was 454 US dollars.</s><s>Structured feedback of information can produce change in physician behaviour. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of 2 educational interventions for improving the quality of care provided by family physicians in Ontario: the Practice Assessment Report (PAR) and the Continuing Medical Education Plan (CMEP) with a follow-up visit by a mentor. A total of 2395 patients randomly sampled from the practices returned questionnaires and consented to have their medical records abstracted. The measures were applied at the beginning (phase 1) and end (phase 2) of the study. The corresponding scores for the CMEP group were 68.3%, 82.1%, 76.4% and 83.2%. In the patient satisfaction component, the personal care scores at phase 2 were 93.6% for the PAR group and 94.6% for the CMEP group. The changes in mean scores between phase 1 and phase 2 ranged from -1.9 to 2.3 points. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in phase 1 or phase 2 scores or in change in scores. Educational interventions based on quality-of-care assessments and directed to global improvements in quality of care did not result in improvements in the outcome measures.</s><s>Voluntary reporting is an important part of postmarketing surveillance but is underused by physicians.

One-hour educational outreach visits tailored to training needs identified in a previous study. At baseline, ADR reporting rates (per 1000 physician-years) did not differ significantly between the intervention groups and the control groups in reporting ADRs overall (7.6 vs 11.3), nor did they differ significantly by category: serious, 4.3 vs 6.0; high-causality, 5.4 vs 7.6; unexpected, 1.6 vs 3.5; and new-drug-related ADRs, 3.7 vs 3.8. The control group had no significant increase in ADR reports during follow-up.</s><s>The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) has produced guidelines for the management of acute low back pain in primary care. To investigate the impact on patient management of an educational strategy to promote these guidelines among general practitioners (GPs). Group randomised controlled trial, using the health centre as the unit of randomisation. Twenty-four health centres were randomly allocated to an intervention or control arm. The management of patients presenting with low back pain to primary care was mostly unchanged by an outreach educational strategy to promote greater adherence to RCGP guidelines among GPs.</s><s>To measure the effectiveness of a multifaceted educational intervention to improve ambulatory hypertension control. Academic detailing, provision of provider-specific data about hypertension control, provision of educational materials to the provider, and provision of educational and motivational materials to patients. When we accounted for clustering by provider, this adjusted odds ratio was 1.13 (95% confidence interval 0.87-1.47). These results were consistent with no effect or, at best, a relatively modest effect of the intervention among patients with hypertension. The effectiveness of future interventions may be improved by focusing on patients whose blood pressure is uncontrolled at baseline.</s><s>This study tests whether an outreach educational program tailored to institutional specific patient care practices would improve the quality of care delivered to mechanically ventilated intensive care unit (ICU) patients in rural hospitals. Twelve randomly selected hospitals received an outreach educational program. After review of the medical records of eligible patients, a multidisciplinary team of intensive care unit specialists from an academic medical center delivered an educational program with content specific to the findings and capacity of the hospital. Results indicated that the outreach program significantly improved many patient care processes (lab work, nursing, dietary management, ventilator management, ventilator weaning). Both total length of stay and ICU length of stay fell markedly in the intervention group (by an average of 3.2 and 2.1 d, respectively), while the control group fell only 0.6 and 0.3 d, respectively. However, improving processes of care may not always translate into improvement of specific outcomes.</s><s>To compare three approaches for marketing a quit smoking intervention kit to general practitioners. A research assistant visited each doctor four months after delivery and measured use of components of the kit. Doctors receiving the educational facilitator approach were significantly more likely than those receiving the other two approaches to have seen the kit, to rate the method of delivery as engendering motivation to try the kit, to have used one of the \"intensive intervention\" components from the kit, to report that they found the kit less complicated, and to report greater knowledge of how to use the kit. The cost of the educational facilitator approach ($A142/doctor) was 24 times that of the mailed approach.</s><s>To evaluate the effectiveness of a health authority/pharmaceutical company collaborative intervention to influence the choice of proton pump inhibitors\n                Randomized controlled trial, with general practices forming the unit of allocation and analysis. There were no reports of representatives operating outside their agreed remit. Prescribing in both the intervention and control group moved towards that recommended by the guidelines but there was no difference between the groups in either the proportion of prescriptions in line with the guidelines or the overall cost. Further work is required to develop effective means to influence prescribing in line with independent guidelines especially in the context of the development of Primary Care Groups.</s><s>The provision of nutritional support for patients in intensive care units (ICUs) varies widely both within and between institutions. A cluster-randomized controlled trial was performed in the ICUs of 11 community and 3 teaching hospitals between October 1997 and September 1998. Patients at least 16 years of age with an expected ICU stay of at least 48 hours were enrolled in the study (n = 499). Evidence-based recommendations were introduced in the 7 intervention hospitals by means of in-service education sessions, reminders (local dietitian, posters) and academic detailing that stressed early institution of nutritional support, preferably enteral.</s><s>The objective was to study the effect of \"academic group detailing\" on the prescribing of lipid-lowering drugs in Swedish primary care. Groups of doctors at 134 community health centres were randomly allocated to an intervention and a control group. The 67 intervention health centres were offered four sessions, conducted by a pharmacist, with group information on guidelines for the management of hyperlipidaemia. The prescription of first-line lipid-lowering drugs increased by 20% in the intervention health centres (p = 0.03).</s><s>Complete diagnostic evaluation or CDE (i.e., colonoscopy or combined flexible sigmoidoscopy plus barium enema X-ray) is often not performed for persons with an abnormal screening fecal occult blood test (FOBT+) result. This study evaluated the impact of a reminder-feedback and educational outreach intervention on primary care practice CDE recommendation and performance rates. Four hundred seventy primary care physicians (PCPs) in 318 practices participated in the study. Practices were randomly assigned to a Control Group (N = 198) or an Intervention Group (N = 120). At baseline, about two-thirds of FOBT+ patients received a CDE recommendation, and about half had a CDE performed.</s><s>To evaluate and compare the effects of two programmes of assessment of practice management in a practice visit: mutual visits and feedback by peers compared with visits and feedback by non-physician observers. A total of 90 general practitioners (GPs) in 68 practices; follow up after one year comprised 81 GPs in 62 practices. Change was defined as the difference in score between the first visit and the visit after one year on 208 indicators and on 33 dimensions of practice management. Data of 44 mutual visits by peers were compared with data of 46 visits by non-physician observers.</s><s>The objective was to evaluate the effect of a clinic-based intervention program on mammography use by inner-city women. A randomized controlled trial employing firm system methodology was conducted. The study setting was a general internal medicine clinic in the university-affiliated county hospital serving metropolitan Seattle. Mammography completion within 8 weeks of clinic visits was significantly higher among intervention (49%) than control (22%) firm women (p < .001). The intervention effect was modified by type of insurance coverage as well as prior mammography history. A clinic-based program incorporating physician education, provider prompts, patient education materials, and appointment reminders and emphasizing nursing involvement can facilitate adherence to breast cancer screening guidelines among inner-city women.</s><s>Providing doctors with new research findings or clinical guidelines is rarely sufficient to promote changes in clinical practice. An implementation strategy is required to provide clinicians with the skills and encouragement needed to alter established routines. Subjects were 128 GPs, one per practice, from the former Northern and Yorkshire Regional Health Authority, who agreed to use the 'Drink-Less' SBI programme in an earlier dissemination trial. GPs were stratified by previous marketing conditions and randomly allocated to three intensities of training and support: controls (n = 43) received the programme with written guidelines only, trained GPs (n = 43) received the programme plus practice-based training in programme usage, trained and supported GPs (n = 42) received the programme plus practice-based training and a support telephone call every two weeks. Costs per patient screened were: trained and supported GPs, 1.05 Pounds; trained GPs, 1.08 Pounds; and controls, 1.47 Pounds. Costs per patient intervened with were: trained and supported GPs, 5.43 Pounds; trained GPs, 6.02 Pounds; and controls, 8.19 Pounds.</s><s>To determine whether office-based interventions increase primary care physicians' risk assessment of and counseling practices for patients regarding sexually transmitted diseases and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Mailed educational materials alone or coupled with a simulated patient instructor office visit. Self-reported and observed frequency of assessing and counseling patients regarding their risk factors for sexually transmitted diseases and HIV infection. Participants were interviewed by telephone before and after the intervention (n = 757). 89% of physicians who received both educational materials and a simulated patient instructor visit reported that they reviewed the educational materials compared with 53% of those who only received the educational materials (P < or = 0.001). Mailed educational materials combined with an office visit by a simulated patient instructor for role-play and feedback on clinical performance increased the frequency of office-based physicians' risk assessment and risk reduction counseling of patients for sexually transmitted diseases and HIV infection.</s><s>To study the effectiveness of a disease management program for patients with acid-related disorders. Enrolled patients included those presenting with new dyspepsia and chronic users of antisecretory drugs in 8 geographically separate physician offices associated with the Orlando Health Care Group. There were 35 providers in the intervention group and 48 in the control group. There were few differences in patient quality of life or symptoms between the 2 study groups. Disease management resulted in fewer days of antisecretory therapy (71.7 vs 88.1 days; P = .02) but no difference in total costs. The effectiveness of such a program in other settings requires further study.</s><s>The effect of patient care appraisal on physicians' management of patients' problems was assessed. Participation in the generation of optimal criteria was followed by a significant improvement in the physicians' behaviour, but involvement in the selection of the conditions to be audited caused no change. The patient care appraisal did not lead to significant improvement of physicians' management of the conditions. Patient care appraisal is an effective tool in continuing medical education and leads to improvement in the quality of care, provided the process focuses on essential criteria of care.</s><s>A study was made of the effect of one-to-one educational meetings between prescribers and a pharmacist on the prescribing of antiulcer agents for outpatients in a health maintenance organization (HMO). Ten-minute presentations were developed that communicated the same basic facts through the use of case studies (vivid interventions) or statistical data (nonvivid interventions). Three clinical pharmacy professors independently evaluated prescriptions for appropriateness of indication, dosage, and duration. Each prescription in the first postintervention month entailed a mean cost of $31 per control practitioner for inappropriate prescribing, compared with less than $12 for the intervention groups (p less than 0.01). Mean costs of inappropriate prescriptions per practitioner per patient visit were $0.88 and less than or equal to $0.41 for the control and intervention groups, respectively (p less than 0.05). One-to-one educational meetings improved the prescribing of antiulcer agents for outpatients in an HMO.</s><s>This study evaluated two different methods of providing practice-based, antibiotic prescribing feedback to general practitioners (GPs). The impact of face-to-face prescribing discussion visits led by a pharmaceutical prescribing adviser were compared to the provision of practice specific prescribing analysis workbooks. The 23 practices who did not wish to participate were used as a self selected control group (Group 3). Twelve months after the start of the programme, visits were extended to Group 2 and Group 3. After 24 months all groups demonstrated significant changes in five indicators.</s><s>Although there is much room for improvement in the performance of recommended preventive manoeuvres, many inappropriate preventive interventions are being done. After baseline data were collected, we randomly assigned the practices to either an 18-month (July 1997 to December 1998) multifaceted intervention delivered by 1 of 3 nurse facilitators (23 practices) or no intervention (23 practices). The outcome measure was an overall index of preventive performance, which was calculated as the proportion of eligible patients who received 8 recommended preventive manoeuvres less the proportion of eligible patients who received 5 inappropriate preventive manoeuvres. Before the intervention, the index of preventive performance was similar for the intervention and control groups (31.9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 27.3%-36.5%] and 32.1% [95% CI 27.2%-37.0%] respectively). At follow-up the corresponding values were 43.2% (95% CI 38.4%-48.0%) and 31.9% (95% CI 26.8%-37.0%), for an absolute improvement in the intervention group of 11.5% (p < 0.001).</s><s>In an attempt to evaluate the efficacy of different methods of interventions to improve the appropriate use of drugs for acute diarrhoea, a controlled study has been carried out in 6 districts in Yogyakarta and Central Java provinces, Indonesia. The districts were randomly assigned into 3 groups and 15 health centers were selected from each district. Prescribers in Group 1 underwent a small group face-to-face intervention conducted in the respective health center. Both interventions were given on a single occasion without follow-up supervision or monitoring. They were also partially effective in improving the appropriate use of drugs, reducing the use of non-rehydration medications. There was also a significant (P < 0.01) reduction in the usage of antidiarrhoeals after both interventions, i.e. from 20.3 +/- 3.7% to 12.5 +/- 3.3% (P < 0.01) after face-to-face intervention and from 48.5 +/- 4.1% to 27.0 +/- 4.3% (P < 0.01) after seminar. However, the formal seminar had a significantly (P < 0.01) greater impact than the small group face-to-face intervention.</s><s>The aim of the present study was to assess whether educational intervention on the primary care physician may be an effective method to improve drug prescription. An experimental randomized controlled study was carried out in 244 physicians of the management area No. Subsequently, a stratified analysis was carried out depending on the volume of prescription of the physicians. The use of oral cephalosporins increased in the IG and was reduced in the CG (p less than 0.01). The results show a favorable impact of personalized information in the groups with high prescription volume, which is particularly remarkable in the highest prescribers.</s><s>To evaluate the feasibility and implementation needs of a cholesterol guideline by assessing the effectiveness of simple dissemination as well as extensive implementation of this guideline on actual performance of general practitioners (GPs). The outcome parameters were defined as quality of selective case finding and quality of diagnostic procedures, and were measured by chart audit. The quality of selective case finding, especially the targeting of cholesterol testing to those with positive cardiovascular risk profiles, did not improve following intervention. Neither simple dissemination nor an intensive programme for improvement had measurable impact on actual performance on working according to the cholesterol guideline. Both the validity and the opinion about feasibility of the guideline in daily practice deserve more attention during guideline development.</s><s>To compare group versus individual academic detailing to increase diuretic or beta-blocker use in hypertension. We conducted a cluster-randomized controlled trial in a large health maintenance organization. We randomly allocated 3 practice sites to group detailing (N=227 prescribers), 3 to individual detailing (N=235 prescribers), and 3 to usual care (N=319 prescribers). The group detailing intervention incorporated the same social marketing principles in small groups of clinicians. In the first year following the intervention, the rates of diuretic or beta-blocker use increased by 13.2% in the group detailing practices, 12.5% in the individual detailing practices, and 6.2% in the usual care practices. As compared with usual care practices, diuretic or beta-blocker use was more likely in group detailing practices (adjusted odds ratio (OR), 1.40; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.11 - 1.76) and individual detailing practices (adjusted OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.95 - 1.79).</s><s>Educational outreach visits, particularly when combined with social marketing, appear to be a promising approach to modifying health professional behaviour, especially prescribing. The outcome measure was routinely collected data from all Danish pharmacies on the sales of asthma medication. Data were collected monthly for 2 years before to 1 year after the intervention.</s><s>To determine whether brief, face-to-face educational outreach visits can improve the appropriateness of blood product utilization. Surgical and medical services of two pairs of matched community and teaching hospitals in Massachusetts. One hundred one transfusing staff surgeons and attending medical physicians. Educational messages emphasized the lack of utility of the traditional threshold for red blood cell transfusions (hematocrit, 30%) and transfusion risks (eg, viral hepatitis). Likely savings in blood use for surgical services probably exceeded program costs, even without considering reduced risks of infection. More data are needed regarding the durability of changes in practice patterns and the health and economic benefits of such interventions.</s><s>There is increasing evidence that clinical guidelines can lead to improvements in clinical care. Intervention practices were offered a visit and the conduct of an audit by a pharmacist trained in the techniques of outreach visiting. The intervention was evaluated using level three Prescribing Analysis and Cost (PACT) data for metronidazole and omeprazole for the two 12 month periods around the introduction of the guidelines. There was a significant increase in omeprazole use during the study of 0.24 [95 per cent confidence interval (CI) +0.19 to +0.29] dose units per year but no effect from the offer [-0.02 (95 per cent CI -0.12 to +0.08) dose units] or acceptance of a visit [-0.03 (95 per cent CI -0.15 to +0.08) dose units]. The effect of the intervention was a non-significant change in prescribing of -0.005 (95 per cent CI -0.025 to +0.015) dose units.</s><s>The objective of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of 2 educational strategies aimed at improving prescribing standards in primary care. The dependent variable is a rate with a numerator that is the number of prescribed units of the NSAIDs recommended during intervention; the denominator is the total number of prescribed units of the NSAID total. One-to-one education obtained an average prescribing behavior improvement of 6.5% (P < 0.001) in the 9 months after intervention. In the education group, the average improvement was 2.4% (P < 0.05) for the same period. The reminder increased significantly the effectiveness of the one-to-one intervention. Results also show that the effectiveness of these interventions increases when presented together with written material.</s><s>Research is needed to validate effective and practical strategies for improving the provision of evidence-based medicine in primary care. 2-year randomized, controlled clinical trial with the practice as the unit of randomization. 20 community-based family or general internal medicine practices in 14 states. 44 physicians, 17 midlevel providers, and approximately 200 staff members; data from the electronic medical records of 87,291 patients. The percentage of indicators at or above predefined targets and the percentage of patients who had achieved each clinical indicator. Patients in intervention practices had greater improvements than those in control practices for diagnoses of hypertension (improvement difference, 15.7 percentage points [95% CI, 5.2 to 26.3 percentage points]) and blood pressure control in patients with hypertension (improvement difference, 8.0 percentage points [CI, 0.0 to 16.0 percentage points]). Primary care practices that use electronic medical records and receive regular performance reports can improve their adherence to clinical practice guidelines for cardiovascular disease and stroke prevention.</s><s>To determine the effectiveness of specialist nurse delivered education in primary care to improve control of hypertension and hyperlipidaemia in patients with diabetes. From 44 practices, 10 303 subjects presenting in general practice with raised blood pressure (= 140/80 mmHg), raised total cholesterol (= 5.0 mmol/l) or both. Practices were randomized to receive either the intervention for hyperlipidaemia or for hypertension; practices acted as control for the intervention not received. They provided educational materials and protocols used in secondary care for nurse and doctor interventions including stepping up pharmacotherapy when necessary. At subsequent annual review, blood pressure and total cholesterol values were obtained from the Salford electronic diabetes register for patients from participating practices. This study provides evidence that the use of specialist nurses to perform educational outreach to improve target adherence to patients with diabetes in primary care is not effective.</s><s>Current understanding of implementation methods is limited, and research has focused on changing doctors' behaviors. Using a factorial design, cluster randomized controlled trial, we evaluated 194 community nurses in 157 family practices and 1078 patients with diagnosis of urinary incontinence (UI) for nurses compliance with evidence-linked review criteria for the assessment and management of UI and impact on psychologic and social well-being and symptoms. In the outreach arms, nurses' self-reported barriers informed development of tailored strategies. In comparison with educational materials alone, the implementation methods tested did not improve care at 6 months follow-up. Adjustment for caseload size, severity or duration of UI and patients' age did not alter results. Greater understanding of the underlying processes in improving performance within multidisciplinary teams through further, theory-driven studies with \"no intervention\" control groups and longer follow-up are needed.</s><s>Evidence exists that some dentists may be failing to perform adequate periodontal diagnostic and preventive care for their patients. Continuing education (CE) is an avenue that is frequently employed as a strategy to alter the style of practice. This paper presents an evaluation of a year-long continuing education intervention \"Periodontics in General Practice\", conducted among randomly selected private general dental practices in Adelaide, South Australia. The study employed a longitudinal quasi-experimental design, which allowed for evaluation of the effectiveness of the intervention among practices employing hygienists (n = 12) and not employing dental hygienists (n = 12), taking into account the covariates of baseline level of provision of periodontal services, the practice's level of participation in the intervention and attendance at other CE courses in periodontics over the year. A comparison group of practice (n = 12) did not participate in the intervention over the year.</s><s>The Health Education and Research Trial (HEART) was a multicenter clinical trial designed to test methods to improve primary care practice systems for heart disease prevention services. The factorial design resulted in 4 study groups: conference only, conference and quality improvement consultations, conference and prevention coordinator, and all interventions combined. Medical record audits and physician, staff, and patient surveys assessed practice change in cardiovascular disease risk factor documentation. Practices participated fully in this project, set goals to improve preventive services, and implemented recommended medical record tools. Documentation of risk factor screening in a recommended-medical record location improved in all intervention groups, with significant sustained improvements in the practices that received the combined intervention. Primary care practices are interested in improving prevention systems and can change these systems in response to supportive external interventions.</s><s>In order to measure the effect of industry-independent information on the prescribing of benzodiazepines in general practice, 128 primary practitioners were randomly allocated to three intervention groups after stratification by year of graduation. A comparison of the number of benzodiazepines prescribed per 100 patient contacts with prescription before and after the intervention showed an average decrease of 3% in the control group, of 14% in physicians who received only written information, and of 24% in physicians who were given additional oral information. A follow-up survey conducted 4 weeks after the intervention showed that the oral information campaign positively affected physicians' attitudes about the value of oral drug information from an industry-independent source.</s><s>To evaluate the effects of feedback reports combined with outreach visits from trained non-physicians on the clinical decision making of general practitioners (GPs) in cardiovascular care. Compliance rates for 12 evidence-based indicators for the management of patients with hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, angina pectoris, or heart failure. The evaluation relied on the prospective recording of patient encounters by the participating GPs. Single handed practices, non-training practices, and practices with older GPs gained particular benefit from the intervention. Intensive support from trained non-physicians can alter certain aspects of the clinical decision making of GPs in cardiovascular care.</s><s>Obesity is one of the most common presenting chronic medical conditions in primary care, yet it is not adequately treated. Physicians are often reluctant to counsel patients because of their limited training in treating chronic weight problems and negative attitudes toward obese patients. Eleven physicians were randomly assigned to either an obesity-counseling skills training group or to a control group. To evaluate pretraining to posttraining changes in physician counseling behavior, independent samples of patients with obesity were surveyed immediately after their visit to the physician's office. This increased to 89% in physicians who received training, whereas it remained at 42% in control physicians.</s><s>To assess whether a multifaceted intervention can reduce the number of prescriptions for antimicrobials for suspected urinary tract infections in residents of nursing homes. 12 nursing homes allocated to a multifaceted intervention and 12 allocated to usual care. Fewer courses of antimicrobials for suspected urinary tract infections per 1000 resident days were prescribed in the intervention nursing homes than in the usual care homes (1.17 v 1.59 courses; weighted mean difference -0.49, 95% confidence intervals -0.93 to -0.06). No significant difference was found in admissions to hospital or mortality between the study arms.</s><s>Despite ongoing concern about adverse effects and dependence on benzodiazepines, approximately 2% of Australians are still taking them on a regular basis. In this randomised trial general practice registrars (n = 157) in New South Wales were allocated to an intervention group (n = 79), which received a 20 minute educational outreach visit; or a control group (n = 78) which received an intervention on an unrelated topic. Overall benzodiazepine prescribing by the intervention group declined from 2.3 to 1.7 per 100 encounters, while the control group also declined from 2.2 to 1.6 per 100 encounters. Analysis of variance showed this was a significant drop over time (P = 0.042) but there was no difference between groups (P = 0.99).</s><s>Private pharmacies are an important source of health care in developing countries. A number of studies have documented deficiencies in treatment, but little has been done to improve practices. We evaluated the short-term impact of this intervention using a before-and-after comparison group design in Kenya, and a randomized controlled design in Indonesia, with the pharmacy as unit of analysis in both countries (n = 107 pharmacies in Kenya; n = 87 in Indonesia). We also measured knowledge about dehydration and drugs to treat diarrhoea among Kenyan pharmacy employees after training. Major discrepancies were found at baseline between reported and observed behaviour. There was a trend toward increased communication in both countries, and in Kenya we observed significant increases in discussion of dehydration during pharmacy visits (p < 0.05). The positive effects and cost-effectiveness of such programmes need to be tested over a longer period for other health problems and in other countries.</s><s>To determine whether an educational package could influence the management of menorrhagia, increase the appropriateness of choice of non-hormonal treatment, and reduce referral rates from primary to secondary care. 100 practices (348 doctors) in primary care were recruited and randomised to intervention (54) and control (46). There were more referrals when tranexamic acid was given with norethisterone than when it was given alone. Those practices reporting fewer than 10 cases showed the highest increase in prescribing of tranexamic acid.</s><s>To evaluate the effectiveness of an asthma resource centre in improving treatment and quality of life for asthmatic patients. Nurse specialists in asthma who educated and supported practice nurses, who in turn educated patients in the management of asthma according to the British Thoracic Society's guidelines. Quality of life of asthmatic patients, attendance at accident and emergency departments, admissions to local hospitals, and steroid prescribing by general practitioners. Of 24 400 patients randomly selected and surveyed in 1993, 12 238 replied; 1621 were asthmatic of whom 1291 were sent a repeat questionnaire in 1996 and 780 replied. Neither attendances at accident and emergency departments nor admissions for asthma showed any tendency to diverge in intervention and control practices over the study period. Further development is required if cost effective management of asthma is to be introduced.</s><s>Antibiotic misuse is common and costly and may promote antibiotic resistance. We tested the efficacy of a targeted one-on-one educational program (\"academic detailing\") designed to improve the appropriateness of broad-spectrum antibiotic use. A randomized controlled trial was conducted in a large US teaching hospital. In multivariable analyses controlling for baseline prescribing and study interval, the rate of unnecessary use of the 2 target antibiotics was reduced by 41% on the intervention services compared with controls (95% confidence interval, 44%-78%; P< .001). Targeted one-on-one education is a practical, effective, and safe method for reducing excessive broad-spectrum antibiotic use.</s><s>Educational outreach visits are commonly used to promote changes in prescribing in family practice. However, the effectiveness of outreach visits has not been evaluated across a range of settings. Educational outreach visits were made to practices that received two of four guidelines. Secondary analyses examined the predictive effect of practice and guideline characteristics. Overall, educational outreach was associated with a significant improvement in prescribing practice (odds ratio [OR] = 1.24 [95% CI = 1.07 to 1.42]), a 5.2% (95% CI = 1.7% to 8.7%) increase in the number of patients treated within the guideline recommendations. There is good evidence to support the use of educational outreach visits in small practices.</s><s>Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing for prostate cancer is controversial. Primary care needs to develop appropriate strategies to respond to this demand. A randomized controlled trial was conducted in general practices in southern Adelaide. The main outcome measures at baseline, 6 months and 12 months post-intervention were PSA testing rates and GP knowledge in key areas relating to prostate cancer and PSA testing. In the 6 months post-intervention, median PSA testing rate in the EOV group was significantly lower than in the postal group, which in turn was significantly lower than the control group (P < 0.001). Clinical practice in this area is receptive to evidence-based interventions.</s><s>We sought to determine whether tailored educational interventions call improve the quality of care, as measured by the provision of preventive care services recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force, as well as lead to better patient satisfaction. Physicians randomly assigned to the comprehensive intervention group also received peer-comparison feedback and academic detailing. Baseline and postintervention (2 to 2.5 years later) surveys examining the provision of preventive care and patient satisfaction were performed and medical records were reviewed. Mammography (90% versus 80%, P <0.01) and clinical breast examination (85% versus 79%, P <0.05) scores worsened in the education only group but not in the comprehensive intervention group. A physician-targeted approach of education, peer-comparison feedback, and academic detailing has modest effects on patient satisfaction and possibly on the offering of selected preventive care services.</s><s>To determine whether locally developed guidelines on asthma and diabetes disseminated through practice based education improve quality of care in non-training, inner city general practices. Randomised controlled trial with each practice receiving one set of guidelines but providing data on the management of both conditions. In practices receiving diabetes guidelines, significant improvements in recording were seen for all seven diabetes variables. In practices receiving asthma guidelines, further improvement was seen only in recording of review of inhaler technique and quality of prescribing in asthma.</s><s>To investigate the feasibility of improving screening for carriers of haemoglobin disorders in general practice by using a nurse facilitator to work with primary care teams and the relevant haematology laboratories; to identify problems in communication between all those involved in delivering the service, and to implement solutions. North London area where 29% of residents and 43% of births are in ethnic groups at risk for haemoglobin disorders. Subjects: 26 of the 93 practices using the services of the area's haematology laboratory agreed to take part and were randomly divided into control and intervention practices. Change in number of requests for screening tests for haemoglobin disorders made by control and intervention practices in baseline and intervention years. Four practices, three of which were singlehanded, accounted for 75% of the increase. Preconceptional carrier screening and counselling need to be coupled with antenatal screening.</s><s>To evaluate the effectiveness of guidelines with or without one-to-one educational outreach visits by community pharmacists in improving general practice prescribing for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Practices were randomised to three groups: control; mailed guidelines; mailed guidelines plus educational outreach visits. General practitioners (GPs) in the latter group received two one-to-one outreach visits from community pharmacists. Changes in prescribing were measured using outcomes derived from prescribing analysis and cost (PACT) data. Although good prescribing at baseline in the participating practices limited the capacity for improvement, this trial provides no evidence that guidelines with or without educational outreach visits from community pharmacists lead to substantial improvements in prescribing behaviour.</s><s>Community pharmacists have increasing involvement in the self-management of minor illness as a result of the availability of a wider range of over-the-counter (OTC) medicines. A 2 x 2 factorial, cluster RCT was conducted with 60 community pharmacies in the Grampian region of Scotland. The interventions included dissemination of an evidence-based guideline for OTC management of vulvovaginal candidiasis (thrush) by postal dissemination (control), educational outreach visit or attendance at a continuing professional education session. There were no significant differences in the proportion of appropriate outcomes following educational outreach [odds ratio (OR) = 1.1; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52 to 2.45] or continuing professional education (OR = 0.88; 95% CI 0.41 to 1.91). Further research is needed to identify barriers to guideline implementation and evidence-based practice in this setting.</s><s>Family physicians (FPs) in Australia underutilize effective strategies to help patients stop smoking. FPs' provision of smoking cessation advice was measured by patient recall, medical record audit, and FP self-report. Logistic regression analysis using generalized estimating equations was performed to assess improvements in practice, after adjustment for clustering by practice. While there were substantial increases in patient recall of assessment of smoking status and FP use of \"quit dates,\" behavioral advice, and written materials in the intervention group, these changes were not significantly greater than those in the control group.</s><s>This was a pilot study of the use of a clinical pharmacist as a therapeutics adviser (academic detailer) to modify antibiotic prescribing by general practitioners. A panel of experts prepared a best practice chart of recommended drugs for upper and lower respiratory tract infections, otitis media and urinary tract infections. Prescribing patterns were similar for the control and active groups in the predetailing period. For both groups, there were significant (P<0.03) increases (45% for control and 40% for active) in total number of antibiotic prescriptions in the post compared with the predetailing period. By contrast, doctors in the control group prescribed significantly more cefaclor (P<0.03) and roxithromycin (P<0.03), drugs that were not recommended. In the same time period, the costs for the active group increased by only 35% ($21 020). We conclude that the academic detailing process was successful in modifying prescribing patterns and that it also decreased prescription numbers and costs. Application of the scheme on a nationwide basis could not only improve prescriber choice of the most appropriate antibiotic but also result in a significant saving of health care dollars.</s><s>To evaluate the effectiveness of an educational visit to help obstetricians and midwives select and use evidence from a Cochrane database containing 600 systematic reviews. Randomised single blind controlled trial with obstetric units allocated to an educational visit or control group. The senior obstetrician and midwife from each intervention unit participated in educational visits. Single informal educational visit by a respected obstetrician including discussion of evidence based obstetrics, guidance on implementation, and donation of Cochrane database and other materials. Rates varied greatly, but the overall baseline mean of 43% (986/2312) increased to 54% (1189/2196) 9 months later. Labour ward guidelines seldom agreed with evidence at baseline; this hardly improved after visits. Further work is needed to define cost effective methods to enhance the uptake of evidence from systematic reviews and to clarify leadership and roles of senior obstetric staff in implementing the evidence.</s><s>To assess the effect of a tailored professional intervention, including academic detailing, on antibiotic prescribing for acute cough. The intervention consisted of a clinical practice guideline for acute cough, an educational outreach visit and a postal reminder to support its implementation in January 2001. Thirty-six of 42 GPs received the intervention and 35 of 43 GPs served as controls; 1503 patients were eligible for analysis. Only in the intervention group were patients less likely to receive antibiotics after the intervention [OR(adj) (95% CI)=0.56 (0.36-0.87)]. No significant differences were found between the groups for the time to symptom resolution. An (inter)actively delivered tailored intervention implementing a guideline for acute cough is successful in optimizing antibiotic prescribing without affecting patients' symptom resolution.</s>"

Patients were placed on three levels of dietary sodium intake: normal, low, and high. There were no significant differences in PEF or PEF amplitude (highest--lowest PEF), an index of asthma lability, between the three dietary salt periods.</s><s>Epidemiologic evidence suggests that high levels of salt consumption are associated with \"spastic\" disorders of smooth muscles, ie, essential hypertension and bronchial asthma. Experimentally, it has been shown that high intake of salt leads to increased bronchial hyperreactivity in asthmatics, ie, enhanced contractility of bronchial muscle to spasmogenic stimuli. The total sodium load during the high salt diet was 191 to 209 mmol of sodium per day and during the sodium-citrate phase, 206 to 223 mmol of sodium per day. Statistical analysis showed that salt loading worsened symptoms (p = 0.06) and increased the use of inhaled steroids (p < 0.05). This effect was presumably mediated by sodium, not chloride, as is demonstrated by loading with sodium citrate. A low-salt diet appears to have a favorable effect in patients with asthma and to reduce the need for anti-asthma drugs.</s><s>The airway response to histamine has been shown to be related to the 24 hour urinary excretion of sodium. The dose of histamine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PD20) was 1.51 doubling doses lower when the men were taking sodium than when they were taking placebo (p less than 0.05). Regressing PD10 against urinary excretion of electrolytes with data from the two occasions during the trial and the measurements made before the trial showed a significant association with sodium excretion after allowance had been made for any effect associated with potassium or creatinine excretion, the latter being a marker of the completeness of the urine collection. These findings are compatible with the differences in regional mortality data for England and Wales, which show a relation between asthma mortality and regional per person purchases of table salt for men but not for women.</s><s>Dietary sodium chloride (NaCl) has been shown to alter the severity of exercise-induced asthma, but it is not known if the sodium and chloride ions have independent effects in this regard. Eight subjects who suffered from EIA and eight subjects who did not (control) took part in a double-blind crossover study. Pre- and post-exercise pulmonary function was assessed after 2 weeks on a NSD, a low NaCl diet (LSD, low sodium, low chloride) or a sodium bicarbonate diet (NaHCO3 diet, high sodium, low chloride). However, both the LSD and the NaHCO3 diet lessened the deterioration in post-exercise pulmonary function in EIA subjects. Similar patterns were observed for forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory flow rate at 25%-75% FVC and peak expiratory flow rate.</s><s>Recent studies have supported a role for dietary salt as a modifier of the severity of exercise-induced asthma. Twenty-four patients participated in a randomized, double-blind crossover study. Pre- and postexercise spirometry, pulmonary diffusion capacity (DLCO) and its subdivisions, and induced sputum were obtained on the NSD and at the end of each 2-wk treatment period (LSD and HSD). FEV1 decreased by 7.9 +/- 2.8% on LSD, 18.3 +/- 4.0% on NSD, and 27.4 +/- 3.2% on HSD at 20 min postexercise. The NSD and HSD induced significant reductions (P < 0.05) in DLCO and its subdivisions. Our findings indicate that dietary salt loading enhances airway inflammation following exercise in asthmatic subjects, and that small salt-dependent changes in vascular volume and microvascular pressure might have substantial effects on airway function following exercise in the face of mediator-induced increased vascular permeability.</s><s>Exercise-induced asthma (EIA) occurs in approximately 90% of persons with asthma. Diet had no effect on preexercise pulmonary function values in either group and had no effect on postexercise pulmonary function values in control subjects. However, LSD improved and HSD worsened postexercise pulmonary function values in EIA subjects. Similar patterns were observed for forced vital capacity and peak expiratory flow rates. Although LSD did not normalize pulmonary function in EIA, it did improve it. These data suggest that individuals with EIA might benefit from lower salt diets.</s><s>There is some evidence of a positive association between increased dietary salt consumption and both increased bronchial reactivity and mortality from asthma in men. This study assesses the effects of alterations in dietary salt consumption on the clinical severity of asthma in adult male asthmatic patients. A randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, crossover design was employed. Patients used diary cards to record twice daily peak expiratory flow rates, daily symptom scores, and bronchodilator consumption. Twenty four hour urinary sodium excretion was measured at screening and in duplicate for each treatment period. Compared with placebo, sodium supplementation resulted in deleterious alterations of all measured parameters. Estimated median (95% CI) difference in bronchodilator consumption was 1.3 (0.4 to 2.1) puffs per day, the estimated median difference in symptom score was 0.6 (0.2 to 0.9), and mean forced expiratory volume in one second fell by 0.21 (0.05 to 0.37) 1.</s>"

        "Abstracts": "<s>It remains uncertain whether the choice of resuscitation fluid for patients in intensive care units (ICUs) affects survival. We randomly assigned patients who had been admitted to the ICU to receive either 4 percent albumin or normal saline for intravascular-fluid resuscitation during the next 28 days. Of the 6997 patients who underwent randomization, 3497 were assigned to receive albumin and 3500 to receive saline; the two groups had similar baseline characteristics. There were 726 deaths in the albumin group, as compared with 729 deaths in the saline group (relative risk of death, 0.99; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.91 to 1.09; P=0.87). In patients in the ICU, use of either 4 percent albumin or normal saline for fluid resuscitation results in similar outcomes at 28 days.</s><s>The treatment of burn shock. A comparative controlled trial of treatment by colloid infusion (dextran-saline), and by exclusively electrolyte infusion (Ringer lactate).</s><s>Cardiovascular resuscitation of the severely injured patient in the field remains unsatisfactory because large volumes of intravenous fluid are needed to keep up with ongoing blood losses and because only small volumes of fluid can be given. In a second study, 7.5% NaCl/dextran 70, 250 mL, was given in a prospective, randomized, and double-blinded trial to injured patients in the field. Blood pressure in the hypertonic/hyperoncotic group increased 49 mmHg during transport (p less than 0.005); blood pressure in patients given lactated Ringer's solution increased 19 mmHg (NS).</s><s>It has a shorter half-life (12 hr), and produces volume expansion at least 1.5 times the administered volume. We compared Pentastarch to Ringer's lactate in 41 patients (21 Pentastarch, 20 Ringer's lactate) presenting with hemorrhagic shock. Serum albumin was the same in both groups throughout the study period; however, serum colloid oncotic pressure was elevated at 1 hr post-resuscitation in the Pentastarch group (P < 0.005).</s><s>Hemodynamic, pulmonary, and renal variables were measured in 24 patients scheduled for major abdominal aortic operations. There were significant increases in Qs/Qt and AaDO2, 48 hours after operation in group 3. Oxygen consumption and cardiac output increased in all groups 24 hours after operation. Significant diuresis occurred in group 1, 48 hours postoperatively, whereas the other two groups continued to retain water.</s><s>The debate over colloid versus crystalloid as the best solution for intraoperative fluid resuscitation is not resolved. In addition, the quality of postoperative recovery between colloid and crystalloid has not been well investigated. Patients undergoing major elective noncardiac surgery were randomized to receive 6% hetastarch in saline (HS-NS), 6% hetastarch in balanced salt (HS-BS), or lactated Ringer's solution (LR) on the basis of a fluid administration algorithm. Hemodynamic targets included maintenance of arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and urine output within a predefined range. A postoperative morbidity survey was performed at baseline and daily after surgery.</s><s>To assess the effects of crystalloid and colloid resuscitation on hemodynamic response and on lung water following thermal injury, 79 patients were assigned randomly to receive lactated Ringer's solution or 2.5% albumin-lactated Ringer's solution. Crystalloid-treated patients required more fluid for successful resuscitation than did those receiving colloid solutions (3.81 vs. 2.98 ml/kg body weight/% body surface burn, p less than 0.01). Ejection fractions were normal throughout the entire study, while Vcf was supranormal (p less than 0.01 vs. normals) and equal in the two resuscitation groups. Cardiac index increased progressively and identically in both treatment groups over the study period (p less than 0.01). These data refute the existence of myocardial depression during postburn resuscitation and document hypercontractile left ventricular performance.</s><s>We compared resuscitation with 0.9% saline vs hydroxyethyl starch, HES 130/0.4, in severe trauma with respect to resuscitation, fluid volume, gastrointestinal recovery, renal function, and blood product requirements. Randomized, controlled, double-blind study of severely injured patients requiring >3 litres of fluid resuscitation. In blunt trauma (n=42), there was no difference in study fluid requirements, but the HES group required significantly more blood products [packed red blood cell volumes 2943 (1628) vs 1473 (1071) ml, P=0.005] and was more severely injured than the saline group (median injury severity score 29.5 vs 18; P=0.01). There was no difference between any groups in time to recovery of bowel function or mortality. In penetrating trauma, renal injury occurred more frequently in the saline group than the HES group (16% vs 0%; P=0.018).</s><s>This study evaluates the hemodynamic effects of the administration of 10% pentastarch solution (PS) during the initial treatment of hypovolemia in trauma patients. Upon admission, the patients were randomized to receive 10% PS (n = 12) or isotonic 0.9% NaCl solution (IS) (n = 11), infused intravenously in 250-ml boluses, repeated until SBP > 100 mmHg. Blood pressure, infused volumes necessary to maintain SBP, and overall survival rates were determined and compared between groups. No blood was transfused into PS patients, compared to 370 +/- 140 ml of red blood cells transfused into IS patients (p = 0.015).</s><s>Cardiac output and pulmonary wedge pressure (PWP) were used to evaluate the end point of fluid resuscitation in 20 patients suffering from multiple trauma and shock. Fifteen of 20 patients had an adequate cardiac output at the termination of resuscitation, but but only six of these patients had a PWP above 10 mm Hg. If the goal of fluid resuscitation is to achieve an adequate cardiac output, then PWP was not a reliable guide. Furthermore, using both cardiac output and PWP as a guide to fluid resuscitation of our patients, we found that the type of fluid (crystalloid or colloid) for resuscitation did not influence the course of respiratory distress in these patients up to three days following resuscitation.</s><s>To explore whether intravenous administration of routinely used crystalloid or colloid solutions differently affects the coagulation system, we investigated orthopaedic patients. During the observation period, thrombin/antithrombin complex increased from 4.8 to 54.7 microg/l, D-dimer increased from 0.3 to 6.0 mg/ml, prothrombin fragment F1 + 2 increased from 1.7 to 5.9 nmol/l, tissue plasminogen activator decreased from 7.3 to 6.7 ng/ml, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 increased from 68.4 to 71.0 ng/ml, plasmin/alpha 2-antiplasmin complex increased from 281.5 to 884 microg/l and factor XIII decreased from 89.0 to 58.5%. All parameters changed significantly but without any detectable difference in the response profile between the groups receiving different intravenous fluids. During knee replacement surgery a pronounced activation of the coagulation/fibrinolytic system was observed, regardless of whether patients received crystalloid or colloid fluids.</s><s>Hypertonic solutions effectively improve hemodynamic parameters in patients admitted to the emergency room. This study evaluates pretreatment prognostic factors that predict a beneficial effect of hypertonic solution in patients admitted to the emergency room with hemorrhagic hypovolemia in a prospective double-blind fashion. There was no difference between groups in the number of blood transfusions administered. The 24 h survival rate was significantly lower in IS (72%) compared with HSD (87%); p < .01. When evaluated for overall survival rate, hypertonic infusion benefited significantly only patients with MAP < 70 mmHg (p < .01).</s><s>The effect of Ringer's Lactate (RL) and a colloid containing salt solution Plasmanate (PL) on extravascular lung water (EVLW) during aortic surgery was evaluated in a prospective study of 18 patients. The groups were well matched for age, associated disease, operating time, blood loss, and blood transfusions. During operation, the RL group required two times the rate of infusion of the PL group. EVLW did not change after operation in either group, despite marked decrease in COP in the RL group.</s><s>The infusion of small volumes of hypertonic saline solution or hypertonic saline plus dextran 70 is remarkably effective in restoring adequate hemodynamic conditions after hypovolemic shock. One hundred five adult patients admitted in hypovolemic shock (systolic blood pressure less than 80 mm Hg) were revived on arrival to the emergency room and administration of a 250 ml intravenous bolus of hypertonic saline solution (n = 35), hypertonic saline plus dextran (n = 35), or isotonic saline solution (n = 35). This infusion was immediately followed by standard crystalloid and blood replacement until systolic pressure reached 100 mm Hg. Plasma volume expansion was calculated from plasma protein concentration measurements. Patients were followed up throughout their hospital course, and results of treatment were recorded. All groups showed similar trends toward restoration of hemodynamic parameters thereafter. There were no significant differences between the groups receiving hypertonic solutions. The incidence of complications was low, and the mortality rate was similar in all groups.</s><s>To compare the efficacy of crystalloid (Normal saline) and colloid (polymer from degraded Gelatin in saline Haemaccel) intravenous fluid in restoration of circulating volume in children with septic shock. Pediatric Emergency and Intensive Care Unit of a tertiary care referral and teaching hospital. Central venous pressure line was placed within first hour, soon after starting fluids. Both the groups were similar with respect to age, gender, primary diagnosis, initial hemodynamic parameters and PRISM score. The mean (SD plasma volume (saline--53.4 (2.0 mL/kg, gelatin polymer--53.2 (1.9 mL/kg), extracellular fluid volume, total body water and interstitial fluid volume at the end of first hour of resuscitation were similar. Both normal saline and gelatin polymer solution were equally effective as resuscitation fluid with respect to restoration of plasma volume and hemodynamic stability. Normal saline upto 110 mL/kg, and gelatin polymer solution upto 70 mL/kg may be required in first hour for successful fluid resuscitation of septic shock in children.</s><s>Small volume infusions of hypertonic saline combined with dextran are very effective in resuscitating animals that have been subjected to hemorrhagic shock, and seem to be effective in resuscitating trauma patients with severe injuries. In this study, the contribution of the dextran component was investigated in a prospective, three-armed, double-blind, randomized trial. Trauma patients transported by ambulance to the hospital with a systolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or less were given 250 mL of (1) normal saline (NS); (2) 7.5% NaCl (HS, for hypertonic saline); or (3) 7.5% NaCl in 6% dextran 70 (HSD). The 7.5% NaCl solution significantly improved upon the predicted survival for the entire cohort and for high-risk patients when compared with the survival estimates from the TRISS methodology.</s><s>In a prospectively randomized trial of 220 patients, 106 were given albumin when their colloid osmotic pressure (COP) fell below 24 cm H2O and 114 were given albumin when their COP fell below 29 cm H2O. The albumin supply, however, did not influence the final outcome of the patients under these circumstances because it treated only a characteristic symptom and not the cause of the disease.</s><s>To evaluate the effect of 7.5% hypertonic saline (HS) and 6% hydroxyethyl starch (HES) 130/0.4 on early fluid resuscitation for severe sepsis. Prospective randomized control trial was carried out in intensive care unit (ICU) of the Affiliated Hospital of Jianghan University. One hundred and thirty five patients with severe sepsis were randomly divided into three groups, each group consisted of 45 patients. There was no significant difference in APACHE II score between HS+HES group (13.2 ± 1.9) and HES group (14.0 ± 1.6), and the APACHEII score in HS+HES group was significantly lower than that in RL group (15.2 ± 1.7, P <0.01). There was no significant difference in MAP, arterial Lac, lactate clearance rate and APACHEII score among three groups. There was no significant difference in mortality among three groups (HS+HES group: 2.2%, HES group: 4.4%, RL group: 8.9%, all P >0.05).</s><s>To investigate the effects of intravascular volume replacement therapy on the inflammatory response during major surgery. Fluid therapy was given perioperatively and continued for 48 hr in the intensive care unit. Biometric and perioperative data, hemodynamics and oxygenation were similar between groups. Release of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 was significantly lower in the HES-group [(peak values) 47.8 +/- 12.1 pg*dL(-1) of IL-6 and 35.8 +/- 11.2 pg*mL(-1) of IL-8 (HES-group) vs 61.2 +/- 11.2 pg*dL(-1) of IL-6 and 57.9 +/- 9.7 pg*mL(-1) of IL-8 (RL-group); P < 0.05]. We hypothesize that this is most likely due to an improved microcirculation with reduced endothelial activation and less endothelial damage.</s><s>Twenty-three patients aged 20-58 years in a serious state of shock and suffering from major pelvic and femoral fractures sustained in traffic accidents were studied. Thus, 12 patients received dextran and 11 patients crystalloid treatment to counteract shock. During the post-resuscitative observation period of 6 days the dextran patients were given 500 ml of dextran daily, while the Ringer group did not receive any colloidal solution. To maintain a stable circulation and a urinary output above 50 ml/h the Ringer patients required significantly more (P less than 0.001) crystalloid solution (910 +/- 300 ml) daily than the dextran patients (460 +/- 400 ml).</s><s>The effects of intravascular volume replacement regimens on tissue oxygen tension (ptiO(2)) are not definitely known. Fluids were administered perioperatively and continued for 24 h on the intensive care unit to keep central venous pressure between 8 and 12 mm Hg. HES 130/0.4 2920 +/- 360 mL and 11,740 +/- 2,630 mL of RL were given to the patients within the study period. The largest differences of ptiO(2) were measured on the morning of the first postoperative day. We conclude that intravascular volume replacement with 6% HES 130/0.4 improved tissue oxygenation during and after major surgical procedures compared with a crystalloid-based volume replacement strategy. In patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, a colloid-based (with hydroxyethyl starch [HES] 130/0.4) and a crystalloid-based (with lactated Ringer's solution [RL]) volume replacement regimen was compared regarding tissue oxygen tension (ptiO(2)) measured continuously by microsensoric implantable catheters. The ptiO(2) increased in the HES-treated (+59%) but decreased in the RL-treated (-23%) patients.</s><s>The effects of hemodynamic resuscitation with protein-containing or balanced salt solution were studied prospectively in 29 patients undergoing abdominal aortic surgery. Serum colloid osmotic pressure (COP), CO, PCWP, the gradient between COP and PCWP (COP-PCWP), and intrapulmonary shunt (Qs/Qt) were measured PO, intraoperatively (IO), and daily for 3 days. Total fluids received for resuscitation (day of operation) was 11.3 +/- 0.8 liters (RL) and 6.2 +/- 0.4 liters (ALB). Maximum decrease in COP was 40% (P less than 0.001) in the RL group and was insignificant in the ALB group. Qs/Qt increased slightly in both groups following operation but was not different between groups. There were no cases of pulmonary edema associated with low COPs and normal PCWPs in the crystalloid group. These data seriously question the necessity to maintain COP by using protein-containing solutions during acute hemodynamic resuscitation.</s><s>The role of fluid resuscitation in the treatment of children with shock and life-threatening infections who live in resource-limited settings is not established. We randomly assigned children with severe febrile illness and impaired perfusion to receive boluses of 20 to 40 ml of 5% albumin solution (albumin-bolus group) or 0.9% saline solution (saline-bolus group) per kilogram of body weight or no bolus (control group) at the time of admission to a hospital in Uganda, Kenya, or Tanzania (stratum A); children with severe hypotension were randomly assigned to one of the bolus groups only (stratum B). All children received appropriate antimicrobial treatment, intravenous maintenance fluids, and supportive care, according to guidelines. Malaria status (57% overall) and clinical severity were similar across groups. The 4-week mortality was 12.2%, 12.0%, and 8.7% in the three groups, respectively (P=0.004 for the comparison of bolus with control). Fluid boluses significantly increased 48-hour mortality in critically ill children with impaired perfusion in these resource-limited settings in Africa.</s><s>The effect of albumin resuscitation for shock on the immune response to tetanus toxoid.</s><s>Extracorporeal circulation induces increased capillary permeability with fluid leakage into the interstitial space, resulting in positive fluid balance and intravascular hypovolaemia. Twenty patients with 3-vessel coronary artery disease undergoing elective coronary artery bypass surgery were studied. A standard regimen for anaesthesia, extracorporeal circulation and monitoring was used. Ringer's acetate solution was added as needed to stabilise haemodynamics postoperatively. Despite reduced need for extra fluid and a decreased cumulative fluid balance, after HSD infusion patients had increased filling pressures of the heart and improved cardiac output. The present study documents that infused hypertonic saline with dextran just after the end of cardiac surgery resulted in mobilisation of the intraoperative fluid excess with increased urine output in the early postoperative period and improved gas exchange.</s><s>The effect of 5 percent human albumin on multiple organ dysfunction was investigated during the first 14 days of treatment to determine whether albumin resuscitation might benefit adult burn patients. Multicenter unblinded controlled trial with stratified block (two patients per block) randomization by center and mortality prediction at enrollment (high-risk stratum [predicted mortality, 50%-90%] and low-risk stratum [predicted mortality, <50%]). The primary outcome was the worst multiple organ dysfunction score (MODS), excluding the cardiovascular component, to Day 14.</s><s>Crystalloid versus colloid in the etiology of pulmonary failure after trauma--a randomized trial in man.</s><s>To investigate the influence of lactate Ringer solution (RL) versus hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 (HES130/0.4) solution on coagulation and fibrinolytic system in the patients with septic shock. Meanwhile, the patients' outcome and the length of intensive care unit stay (ICU-LOS) were recorded. ICU-LOS (days) in HES group was significantly shorter than the RL group (12.5 ± 8.8 vs. 17.1 ± 16.6, P < 0.01). In RL group, 12 patients died and 8 patients survived, while in HES group, 7 patients died and 15 patients survived, showing no difference between two groups. PT, APTT and the levels of t-PA showed no significant differences between two groups at different time points, but the levels of plasma PAI (μg/L) of the HES group decreased gradually, and was significantly lower than that before resuscitation and RL group at 24 hours after resuscitation (41.76 ± 25.95 vs. 89.11 ± 14.27, 55.08 ± 35.43, both P < 0.05).</s><s>In 38 critically burned patients with symptomatic hypovolemia being treated by intravenous fluids, the accuracy of colloid oncotic pressure (COP) calculated from the refractometrically-determined serum total protein (TPRI) was compared with COP values determined by a commercially-available clinical oncometer. There was poor correlation between COP measure and that calculated from RI in patients receiving colloid-free fluid, but high correlation (r = 0.925) in patients receiving HALFD. There was high correlation (r = 0.951) between measured COP and values calculated from TPRI in patients receiving hypertonic fluid, colloid containing hypertonic fluid, or no fluid:COP = 4.08 (TPRI)--4.61.</s><s>It is unknown whether fluid resuscitation with colloid or crystalloid in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock is associated with an improvement in clinical outcome. This randomized controlled trial determined the feasibility of conducting a large trial testing resuscitation with pentastarch vs normal saline in early septic shock, powered for a difference in mortality. At three Canadian and one New Zealand academic centre, 40 patients with early septic shock defined by at least two systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria, infectious source, and persistent hypotension after >or= 1 L of crystalloid fluid were recruited. Feasibility measures were patient recruitment, blinding of the study fluids, and acceptability of the goal directed algorithms. Of 161 patients screened, 121 were excluded and 40 patients were enrolled, for a recruitment rate of 0.75 patients/site/month. Only 57% of physicians and 54% of nurses correctly guessed the study fluid (P = 0.46 and P = 0.67, respectively).</s><s>To determine whether out-of-hospital administration of hypertonic fluids would improve survival after severe injury with hemorrhagic shock. Inclusion criteria: injured patients, age ≥ 15 years with hypovolemic shock (systolic blood pressure ≤ 70 mm Hg or systolic blood pressure 71-90 mm Hg with heart rate ≥ 108 beats per minute). On the recommendation of the data and safety monitoring board, the study was stopped early (23% of proposed sample size) for futility and potential safety concern. : A total of 853 treated patients were enrolled, among whom 62% were with blunt trauma, 38% with penetrating. There was no difference in 28-day survival-HSD: 74.5% (0.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], -7.5 to 7.8); HS: 73.0% (-1.4; 95% CI, -8.7-6.0); and NS: 74.4%, P = 0.91. Among injured patients with hypovolemic shock, initial resuscitation fluid treatment with either HS or HSD compared with NS, did not result in superior 28-day survival.</s><s>The effects of fluid resuscitation with 6% hetastarch, 5% albumin, or 0.9% saline solutions on plasma colloid osmotic pressure (COP) were examined in 26 patients with hypovolemic circulatory shock. The mean COP increased from 16.3 +/- 1.6 (SE) mm Hg to a maximum of 23.7 +/- 1.4 mm Hg during the first 24 h of hetastarch resuscitation (p less than 0.01), and from 17.0 +/- 1.1 to 22.3 +/- 1.5 mm Hg with albumin (p less than 0.001).</s><s>The efficacy of intravenous or intraosseous infusion of 250 ml of 7.5% NaCl and 6% dextran 60 (H/H) was compared with intravenous Ringer's lactate (RL) for the initial treatment of patients with hemorrhagic shock due to upper gastrointestinal bleeding. 49 patients were randomly assigned to receive either H/H (n = 26) or RL (n = 23). H/H patients were analyzed together since no differences were noticed between the routes of infusion. The H/H group also received 2.3 +/- 0.7 liters of intravenous crystalloid solutions in the first hour and 4.4 +/- 0.1 liters in the 24-hour period, while RL received 3.3 +/- 0.7 and 7.3 +/- 2.4 liters, respectively.</s><s>ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: Inadequate initial treatment and delayed hemodynamic stabilization (HDS) may be associated with increased risk of death in severe sepsis patients. Time to reach HDS was 11.8 10.1 hours vs. 14.3 ±11.1 hours for HES and NaCl, respectively. Acute renal failure occurred in 24 (24.5%) and 19 (20%) patients for HES and NaCl, respectively (P = 0.454). There was no difference between AKIN and RIFLE criteria among groups and no difference in mortality, coagulation, or pruritus up to 90 days after treatment initiation. CONCLUSION: Significantly less volume was required to achieve HDS for HES vs. NaCl in the initial phase of fluid resuscitation in severe sepsis patients without any difference for adverse events in both groups.</s><s>We evaluated the potential side effects of rapidly infusing 250 mL of either 7.5% sodium chloride or 7.5% sodium chloride per 6% dextran 70, using lactated Ringer's as the control, to 106 critically injured patients in two prospective double-blinded emergency department trials. Other blood chemistry changes that might have been associated with the hypertonic solutions, such as hyperosmolality or hypernatremia, were made insignificant by other factors, such as high blood alcohol levels or concomitant administration of sodium bicarbonate. There were no cases of central pontine myelinolysis; bleeding was not potentiated.</s><s>Hydroxyethyl starch (HES) [corrected] is widely used for fluid resuscitation in intensive care units (ICUs), but its safety and efficacy have not been established in patients with severe sepsis. Of the 804 patients who underwent randomization, 798 were included in the modified intention-to-treat population. At 90 days after randomization, 201 of 398 patients (51%) assigned to HES 130/0.42 had died, as compared with 172 of 400 patients (43%) assigned to Ringer's acetate (relative risk, 1.17; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01 to 1.36; P=0.03); 1 patient in each group had end-stage kidney failure. Patients with severe sepsis assigned to fluid resuscitation with HES 130/0.42 had an increased risk of death at day 90 and were more likely to require renal-replacement therapy, as compared with those receiving Ringer's acetate. (Funded by the Danish Research Council and others; 6S ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00962156.</s><s>Differences in hemodynamic stability and fluid requirements were examined in patients randomly assigned to receive either normal saline crystalloid solution (N = 10) or hetastarch colloid solution (N = 11) after coronary artery bypass or valve operation. Despite lower filling pressures, subjects receiving hetastarch exhibited higher systolic blood pressures and cardiac outputs (p less than 0.05). The subjects given hetastarch also required significantly less time in the intensive care unit (p less than 0.001). Thus, cardiac surgical patients receiving colloids exhibited reduced fluid requirements, superior hemodynamic performance, and shortened intensive care stay when compared with those given crystalloid resuscitation.</s><s>To study the effects on volume expansion and myocardial function of colloids or crystalloids in the treatment of hypovolaemic hypotension after cardiac and major vascular surgery. A single-centre, single-blinded, randomized clinical trial at the intensive care unit of a university hospital. Patients (n=67) were subjected to a 90-min filling pressure-guided fluid challenge with saline 0.9% or the colloids gelatin 4%, hydroxyethyl starch 6% or albumin 5%. Biochemical variables and haemodynamics (transpulmonary thermodilution) were measured. Plasma volume increased by 3.0% (-18 to 24) in the saline versus 19% (-11 to 50) in the colloid groups (P< 0.001). Colloid fluid loading leads to a greater increase in preload-recruitable cardiac and left ventricular stroke work indices than that with saline, because of greater plasma volume expansion following an increase in plasma COP.</s><s>Hydroxyethyl starch (HES) solutions are often used for maintaining intravascular volume and improving microperfusion, while a large amount of HES can cause adverse effects on coagulation. As the indications for clopidogrel expand, an increasing number of patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery (OPCAB) are also undergoing dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), with its higher risk of bleeding complications. The aim of the present study was to determine whether a moderate dose of 6% HES 130/0.4 significantly increases perioperative blood loss in patients with continued DAPT within 5 days of OPCAB. The amount of perioperative blood loss (sum of bleeding during the intraoperative and postoperative 24-h period), transfusion requirements, modified thromboelastography and coagulation variables, hemodynamic parameters, and fluid balance were recorded. HES 130/0.4 caused a similar degree and duration of coagulation impairment as observed when only crystalloid was given.</s><s>The effect of a 20% albumin solution on plasma oncotic pressure, renal function and peripheral oedema was investigated in 30 adult patients undergoing elective major abdominal surgery. Otherwise the same schedules for fluid therapy and blood replacement were followed in all patients. Postoperatively, serum albumin and plasma oncotic pressure were fairly normal in the albumin group, but decreased by 28% and 24% in the control group. The difference between the groups was statistically significant during the first week, but disappeared during the second week. Arm and thigh circumferences increased postoperatively to a similar extent in both groups. The limited availability and high cost of albumin require strict indications for its use.</s><s>infusion of 5% albumin and balanced salt solutions were investigated in a prospective study on 18 patients subjected to reconstruction of the abdominal aorta. Immediately after operation, there was a decrease in cardiac filling pressures, indicating a blood volume deficit, in both groups. Less fluid was needed for adequate haemodynamic restitution in the albumin group. Postoperatively, the mean plasma oncotic pressure (POP) in the albumin-treated patients remained steady at 2.4-2.5 kPa (86-88% of preoperative value). In the control group, POP fell to a mean minimum of 1.8 kPa (64% of preoperative value) 8 h after operation. No clinically important differences in haemodynamic or lung function variables were found between the groups.</s><s>To determine the relative distribution of fluid within the extracellular fluid volume (ECFV) after infusing either normal saline or 5% albumin in septic, critically ill patients. Infusion of either normal saline or 5% albumin to a hemodynamic end point determined by the patient's clinician. Plasma volume (PV), ECFV, cardiac index, and arterial oxygen content were measured immediately before (baseline) and after each fluid infusion. PV and ECFV were measured by dilution of 131I-albumin and 35S sodium sulfate, respectively. Infusion of normal saline increased the ECFV by approximately the volume infused, and the expansion of the PV to ISFV was in a ratio of 1:3.</s><s>The objective of this study was to compare the cardiac and hemodynamic responses to a rapid infusion of 1000 ml of modified fluid gelatin (group A) or 1000 ml of lactated Ringer's solution (group B) in emergency room patients suffering from shock. This prospective, randomized, open, noncrossover study was performed at a medical center university hospital in a surgical resuscitation room in the emergency department. The subjects were 34 patients with either hypovolemic or neurogenic shock who were admitted to the emergency room. A resuscitation protocol according to Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) with an additional central venous line or Swan-Ganz catheters for hemodynamic monitoring was used. In patients with traumatic or neurogenic shock due to acute volume deficiency, there was significantly better hemodynamic improvement, judged by CVP and PAOP measurements using the modified fluid gelatin for volume replacement than with lactated Ringer's solution during the first hour of resuscitation.</s><s>Interleukin-2 (IL-2)-based therapy induces a vascular leak syndrome (VLS), manifested by hypotension, tachycardia, and oliguria, as is also seen with septic shock. A prospective randomized trial was undertaken to compare crystalloid and colloid fluid resuscitation for patients receiving bolus IL-2-based therapy for metastatic cancer. Of 107 patients who completed one cycle of therapy on study, 76 completed a full treatment course (two cycles) on study. The total number of saline and albumin fluid boluses given were 9.5 +/- 0.9 versus 7.7 +/- 0.7 (p = 0.36, n = 107) for the first cycle and 19.2 +/- 1.8 versus 16.1 +/- 1.6 (p = 0.33, n = 76) for a complete course, respectively. Although patients receiving saline boluses had significantly more oliguria during a course of therapy, weight gain, number of IL-2 doses, tachycardia, hypotension, vasopressor use, hospital stay, and clinical response rates did not significantly differ between arms.</s><s>Twenty-nine patients, subjected to major abdominal surgery, were randomized to different types of postoperative fluid replacement, given on the basis of subcutaneous oxygen tension measurements (PscO2). One regimen consisted of crystalloids, the other of a combination of crystalloids and colloids (dextran 70). Perioperative fluid replacement was given according to clinical criteria and postoperatively according to polarographic PscO2 measurements. In conclusion, postoperative fluid substitution with dextran has no advantages over crystalloids only, with regard to granulation tissue formation if postoperative fluid support is optimum, according to PscO2 measurements.</s><s>The influence of four different kinds of intravascular volume replacement on platelet function was investigated in 60 patients undergoing elective aortocoronary bypass grafting using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). In a randomized sequence, high-molecular weight hydroxyethyl starch solution (HMW-HES, mean molecular weight [Mw] 450,000 d), low-molecular weight HES (LMW-HES, Mw 200,000 d), 3.5% gelatin or 5% albumin were infused preoperatively to double reduced filling pressure (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure [PCWP] < 5 mm Hg). Platelet function was assessed by aggregometry using turbidometric technique (inductors: ADP, epinephrine, collagen). Maximum aggregation, maximum gradient of aggregation, and platelet volume were measured before, during, and after CPB until the first postoperative day. The other volume groups showed less reduction in platelet aggregation and were similar to the untreated control. Platelet volume was the same among the groups within the investigation period.</s><s>We report the results of the first clinical study on the use of a hypertonic saline-dextran solution for the prehospital management of hypotensive victims of penetrating trauma. There were no complications associated with the infusion of the hypertonic saline-dextran solution, and execution of the protocol by paramedic personnel was both safe and uniformly successful.</s><s>Crystalloid and colloid infusion can be used in volume therapy following heart surgery. In this prospective, randomised study we compared Ringer's solution (group R) to Haemaccel (group H) following coronary artery bypass grafting. There was no significant difference in EVLWI, pulmonary shunt fraction, and time on mechanical ventilation. Likewise, chest tube drainage was not significantly different in both groups.</s><s>In a randomized study including 55 patients undergoing elective aorto-coronary bypass surgery efficacy of a low concentrated hydroxyethylstarch (3% HES 200/0.5) was tested after extracorporeal circulation (ECC). Hemodynamic parameters, laboratory parameters as well as extravascular lung water (EVLW - double indicator dilution technique) were measured before ECC as well as before and after infusion therapy. With regard to hemodynamic efficiency and the change in laboratory data no relevant differences between group I, II and III could be seen. 3% HES 200/0.5 solution can be considered as an effective volume substitute with short intravascular retention time, which seems to be of advantage in patients coming off extracorporeal circulation.</s><s>To compare a solution of 3% dextran-60 (D60) in Ringer's lactate (RL) with RL alone as maintenance fluids for abdominal aortic surgery. Randomized control trial of 20 consecutive patients undergoing elective aortic reconstructive surgery. Consecutive patients, mean age 64 yr. Five patients had abdominal aneurysm, 12 had aortic obstruction disease, and three had aortic renal bypass surgery. A total intravascular dextran of 0.5 g/kg resulted in a PV expansion at 1 hr of 4.4 mL/kg above preoperative level, in sharp contrast to 7.0 mL/kg decrease in PV with RL. A diluted colloid solution in Ringer's lactate is of significant value in maintaining intravascular volumes and hemodynamics during and after major operative procedures.</s><s>Dengue shock syndrome is characterized by severe vascular leakage and disordered hemostasis and progresses to death in 1 to 5 percent of cases. We randomly assigned 383 children with moderately severe shock to receive Ringer's lactate, 6 percent dextran 70 (a colloid), or 6 percent hydroxyethyl starch (a colloid) and 129 children with severe shock to receive one of the colloids. The primary outcome measure was requirement for rescue colloid at any time after administration of the study fluid. The primary outcome measure--requirement for rescue colloid--was similar for the different fluids in the two severity groups. Although treatment with Ringer's lactate resulted in less rapid improvement in the hematocrit and a marginally longer time to initial recovery than did treatment with either of the colloid solutions, there were no differences in all other measures of treatment response. Initial resuscitation with Ringer's lactate is indicated for children with moderately severe dengue shock syndrome.</s><s>A prospective randomized double-blind study was performed to determine the effects of three colloids, Haemaccel, Gelofusine and albumin, and also saline on platelet activation, platelet aggregation (induced by adenosine diphosphate (ADP), epinephrine, collagen) platelet agglutination by ristocetin and other hemostatic variables in 55 patients undergoing primary unilateral total hip replacement. The fluids were administered according to normal clinical practice and assessments were made immediately before, at the end, and 2 h after the end of surgery. Generally, the platelet activation appeared to result in platelet desensitization and brought about a persistent reduction in platelet aggregation to ADP and epinephrine, irrespective of the fluid used. Additionally, Haemaccel and Gelofusine inhibited ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination and albumin inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation. Gross inhibitory effects of Haemaccel that had been predicted from an earlier in vitro study did not occur.</s><s>To investigate the effect of medium molecular weight hydroxyethyl starch solution (HES) administered as replacement for estimated blood losses (EBL) during cytoreductive surgery for ovarian carcinoma on splanchnic oxygenation. There was no significant difference in arterial lactate acid concentration between the two groups. In patients undergoing major surgery, volume resuscitation with medium molecular weight HES improves the splanchnic blood flow and tissue oxygenation.</s><s>The effects on fluid balance, pulmonary functions and economics were evaluated in a randomized comparison of one colloid free and three colloid containing fluid regimens, for 48 hours during and after coronary artery bypass (CAB) surgery. A standard regimen for anaesthesia, extracorporeal circulation and monitoring was used. Only Ringer's acetate (RAc) was used as priming solution for extracorporeal circulation. At 48 hours, however, there were no differences in cumulative fluid balance. Patients in the colloid groups postoperatively had a higher serum colloid osmotic pressure (s-COP), but a higher net lung capillary filtration pressure (delta P) only on the second postoperative day than the RAc group. The most expensive colloid fluid regimen (albumin) cost about 230 US$ more per patient than the RAc fluid regimen.</s><s>In a prospective randomized trial of 16 patients undergoing abdominal vascular reconstructive procedures, changes in plasma volume, serum oncotic pressure (pis), serum albumin and total protein concentration, alveolar to arterial oxygen tension differences (AaDO2, FIO2 = 1.0), creatinine clearance, body weight, and fluid and sodium intake were examined. By random assignment patients received either an albumin- or a sodium-rich intraoperative fluid regimen. Postoperative values of albumin concentration, circulating albumin mass and pis were significantly greater in the albumin group in comparison to the electrolyte group. The change in pis correlated significantly with sodium intake and circulating albumin mass.</s><s>Children and young people ranging in age from 5 months to 21 years, with burns covering greater than or equal to 30 per cent of the body surface area, were entered into a prospective study comparing the resuscitative efficacy of hypertonic lactated saline (HLS) and Ringer's lactate-colloid (RL-colloid). The 24- and 48-h fluid requirements of children resuscitated with the RL-colloid were significantly greater than those resuscitated with HLS (P less than 0.02); 2.37 +/- 0.91 ml/kg/per cent burn (HLS) v. 3.43 +/- 1.51 ml/kg/per cent burn (RL-colloid) at 24 h post-burn and 4.18 +/- 1.37 ml/kg/per cent burn (HLS) v. 6.32 +/- ml/kg/per cent burn (RL-colloid) at 48 h (P less than 0.01). Patients in the RL-colloid group gained significantly more weight at 48 h (P less than 0.05). The sodium requirements and resulting sodium balances were not significantly different. Colloid oncotic pressures, serum albumin and albumin/globulin (A/G) ratios were not significantly different between the two groups until 48 h post-burn.</s><s>To determine the acute hemodynamic effect of hypertonic saline and/or colloid solutions as volume resuscitation in postoperative mitral valve repair patients. Twenty-six patients who underwent mitral valve repair were prospectively studied. In the HS-HES and HS groups, systemic vascular resistances decreased significantly and end-systolic area tended to decrease. A major increase in cardiac index was observed after hypertonic solutions infusion, from 2.9 +/- 0.3 to 4.1 +/- 0.4 L/min/m2 in the HS-HES group and from 2.7 +/- 0.3 to 3.8 +/- 0.4 L/min/m2 in the HS group. Then, cardiac index progressively returned to baseline values within the 3 hrs after the infusion. These side effects are likely attributable to a too-high dose and/or rate of infusion. All patients included in the study were discharged from the hospital before the 10th postoperative day. The use of these hypertonic solutions may be of interest in patients with valvular cardiomyopathy.</s><s>The accuracy of the STAT-CRIT hematocrit (hct) was compared to Coulter and centrifuge methods in this study of the interrelationship between non-red cell blood constituents and accuracy of conductivity-based hct measurements. In the second part of the study, patients were randomized to receive either 5% albumin (n = 14) or isotonic crystalloid (n = 14) after termination of CPB to determine the effect of protein colloid replacement on conductivity-based hct measurements. Blood samples were obtained before and after fluid volume replacement for multivariate analysis. Single regression analysis indicated that a 1-g/dL decrease in TP resulted in an absolute decrease in the hct reading by 1 hct% units. A 10-mmol/L change in either Cl or Na concentration resulted in a change in Stat-Crit accuracy of 3.5% and 2.5%, respectively.</s><s>Dengue hemorrhagic fever is an important cause of morbidity among Asian children, and the more severe dengue shock syndrome (DSS) causes a significant number of childhood deaths. Fluid resuscitation is critical, but as yet there have been no large trials to determine the optimal fluid regimen. All the children survived, and there was no clear advantage to using any of the 4 fluids, but the longest recovery times occurred in the lactated Ringer's group. The most significant factor determining clinical response was the pulse pressure at presentation.</s><s>Forty-six patients with severe pulmonary insufficiency were prospectively studied to compare the effects of resuscitation with either crystalloid or colloid. By random number, 26 patients received RL and 20 patients received 5 per cent ALB to maintain hemodynamic stability. For the duration of the study and at 48 hours, there was no statistically significant difference between groups with respect to the following: cardiac index, colloid osmotic pressure (COP), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), COP-PCWP gradient, right and left ventricular stroke work indices, and amount of constant positive airway pressure required for treatment. Both groups had a significant improvement in intrapulmonary shunt (Qs/Qt) after 24 hours of treatment.</s><s>The effects of intraoperative changes in plasma colloid osmotic pressure (COP) on the formation of intestinal edema were studied in patients during modified Whipple's operation (hemipancreato-duodenectomy). Eighteen patients (ASA physical status I or II) were randomly assigned to one of three groups. They received either lactated Ringer's (RL group, n = 6), 10% hydroxyethyl starch (HES group, n = 6), or 20% human albumin (HA group, n = 6) as a volume replacement solution, which was given to maintain central venous pressure (CVP) at the preoperative level. Jejunal specimens were obtained after the first transsection of the jejunum and prior to the jejuno-jejunostomy. COP was determined prior to induction of anesthesia and upon removal of the second jejunal sample.</s><s>We report a clinical study on the use of 7.2%, 2400 mOsm/L, hypertonic saline solution compared with gelatin in early postoperative period after coronary artery bypass surgery. Two groups (n = 10 each) received 5 ml/kg of either saline solution or gelatin over 1 hour. Cardiac index, central venous pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance indices, arterial oxygen tension, plasma osmolarity, electrolytes, and urinary output were recorded before starting the infusion and subsequently at 10, 30, 60, 90, 120, 240 and 600 minutes. There were no significant demographic or operative difference between the groups. Patients receiving saline solution had a larger diuresis at 12 (p = 0.0008) and 24 hours (p = 0.002), with less positive balance at 12 hours (p = 0.0008). Compared with the gelatin-treated group, patients receiving saline solution had unchanged systemic vascular resistance index but a significantly lower pulmonary vascular resistance index with a negative correlation to plasma sodium content.</s><s>Metabolic acidosis is the best predictor of death in children with severe falciparum malaria; however, its treatment presents a therapeutic dilemma, because acidosis and hypovolemia may coexist with coma, which can be associated with elevated intracranial pressure. We randomly assigned children with severe malaria and metabolic acidosis (base deficit, >8 mmol/L) to receive fluid resuscitation with either 4.5% albumin or normal saline. A control (maintenance only) group was only included for patients with a base deficit of <15 mmol/L. Of 150 children recruited for the trial, 61 received saline, 56 received albumin, and 33 served as control subjects. Our study design did not enable us to determine whether saline administration is preferable to fluid restriction or whether saline administration is actually hazardous.</s><s>The effect of postoperative fluid management on pulmonary extravascular thermal volume (ETVL) as in index of pulmonary extravascular water after coronary artery bypass grafting was compared, using the thermal-dye technique, among five patients who received 5% albumin (group A), five patients who received 6% hydroxyethyl starch (group H), and five who received lactated Ringer's solution (group C). No statistically significant changes in ETVL occurred postoperatively in any group, nor did ETVL differ significantly between groups. Pulmonary shunt fraction (Qsp/Qt) did not change in groups A and C but decreased during CPB in group H (from 0.22 +/- 0.03 to 0.16 +/- 0.11). Postoperatively, patients in the three groups received similar volumes of fluids and had similar perioperative weight gains. In Group H, Qsp/Qt returned to levels observed before CPB by AM1 (0.27 +/- 0.09). We conclude that in patients without postoperative increases in WP, ETVL changes minimally during CPB and is not influenced by the type of fluid administered as the primary volume replacement in the postoperative period.</s><s>This prospective randomized study deals with the changes in magnitude and distribution of the extracellular fluid volume (ECV) and the relation between such changes and the plasma colloid osmotic pressure (COPP) in patients having abdominal aortic surgery. Two groups of thirteen patients each received whole blood to replace the blood loss. In the NON-ALB group the preoperative ECV of 8.1 +/- 1.11 (= 125 ml/kg) was unchanged on the first p.o.d. The post-operative changes observed in ECV were not related to COPP in the range 33 mmHg to 21 mmHg. Postoperative changes were non-significant and no correlation between COPP and PV/ECV could be found. Furthermore, no obligatory contraction or expansion of ECV occurred after major elective surgery.</s><s>This study aimed to address whether hydroxyethyl starch (HES) is beneficial for intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) in early stages. The groups received 6% HES 130/0.4 for 8 days and RL solution without colloid, respectively. The secondary end points were fluid balance, major organ complications, the Acute Physiology and Chronic Heath Evaluation II score, and the serum levels of C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and interleukin-8. In the HES group, the IAP was significantly lower in 2 to 7 days, and fewer patients received mechanical ventilation (15.0% vs 47.6%).</s><s>We compared Ringer's acetate-gluconate solution with 6% dextran-70 infused during rewarming after coronary bypass surgery. Data were taken at the following intervals: 4 to 5 h after terminating the cardiopulmonary bypass, after rewarming, the next morning on controlled ventilation and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) breathing, and after extubation. Prophylactic nitroglycerin infusion may have increased the need for plasma expansion. After transition to the CPAP mode, hydrostatic pressures increased, more in group 2, doubling the pulmonary shunt flow.</s><s>The aim of this study was to show that 6% hydroxyethyl starch (HES) 130/0.4 achieves a better resuscitation of the microcirculation than normal saline solution (SS), during early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) in septic patients. Patients with severe sepsis were randomized for EGDT with 6% HES 130/0.4 (n = 9) or SS (n = 11). Sublingual microcirculation was evaluated by sidestream dark field imaging 24 hours after the beginning of EGDT. Sublingual capillary density was similar in both groups (21 ± 8 versus 20 ± 3 vessels/mm(2)); but capillary microvascular flow index, percent of perfused capillaries, and perfused capillary density were higher in 6% HES 130/0.4 (2.5 ± 0.5 versus 1.6 ± 0.7, 84 ± 15 versus 53 ± 26%, and 19 ± 6 versus 11 ± 5 vessels/mm(2), respectively, P < .005).</s><s>To evaluate the use of 250 mL of a 7.5% sodium chloride solution, both with and without added dextran 70, for the prehospital resuscitation of hypotensive trauma patients. Injured patients with systolic blood pressures less than 90 mm Hg at any time in the field or during helicopter transport. Blood pressure response; survival to time of hospital discharge among the treatment groups; and survival compared with that predicted by norms from the Major Trauma Outcome Study (MTOS). The mean (+/- SD) change in systolic blood pressure on arrival in the emergency department was significantly higher in the hypertonic saline solution group than that in the lactated Ringer's solution group (34 +/- 46 vs 11 +/- 49 mm Hg, P < .03). Overall survival in the four treatment groups was 49%, 60%, 56%, and 45% (not statistically significant). Patients with low baseline Glasgow Coma Scale scores seem to benefit the most from 7.5% sodium chloride resuscitation.</s>"

These women were also more dissatisfied with the number of visits they received (odds ratio 2.50; 2.00 to 3.11). Patterns of antenatal care involving fewer routine visits for women at low risk may lead to reduced psychosocial effectiveness and dissatisfaction with frequency of visits. For the variables reported, the visit schedules studied are similar in their clinical effectiveness.</s><s>To compare a five-visit antenatal care (ANC) model with specified goals with the standard model in a rural area in Zimbabwe. Cluster randomised controlled trial with the clinic as the randomisation unit. Primary care setting in a developing country where care was provided by nurse-midwives. Twenty-three rural health centres were stratified prior to random allocation to the new (n = 11) or standard (n = 12) model of care. There was no difference in median maternal age, parity and gestational age at booking between women in the standard model and those in the new model. The proportion of women with five or less visits was 77% in the new and 69% in the standard model (OR 1.5; 95% CI 1.08-2.2).

Upon entry into prenatal care, all women were of low obstetrical risk status. Women in the APCVS group reported significantly higher levels of satisfaction than women in the TPCVS group on both the satisfaction with provider subscale (F = 5.74, P = .02) and the satisfaction with the prenatal care system subscale (F = 2.01, P = .04). There were no statistically significant differences found in anxiety scores between women in the two study groups.</s><s>In 1989, the Expert Panel on the Content of Prenatal Care established guidelines on the timing and content of prenatal care, including a schedule consisting of fewer prenatal visits than traditionally provided, for women at low risk of adverse perinatal outcomes. We tested the hypothesis that there are no significant increases in adverse perinatal outcomes when low-risk women are seen in a prenatal care visit schedule of fewer visits than routinely advised. On average, there were 2.7 fewer visits observed in the experimental group than in the control group. There were no differences between the two groups in patients' satisfaction with quality of prenatal care.</s><s>To investigate the impact of an alternative prenatal care program for low-risk patients. Five hundred forty-nine low-risk pregnant women were allocated to the study and control groups. The study group received, on average, eight visits, all of them with one of nine study providers. Each study visit had specific objectives and accompanying targeted patient education handouts. The study vs. control group differed significantly (P < .0001) in patient satisfaction regarding the number of prenatal visits. An alternative prenatal care program for low-risk patients reduced resource utilization without adversely affecting prenatal care process variables, pregnancy outcome or patient satisfaction.</s><s>We undertook a multicentre randomised controlled trial that compared the standard model of antenatal care with a new model that emphasises actions known to be effective in improving maternal or neonatal outcomes and has fewer clinic visits. Clinics in Argentina, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, and Thailand were randomly allocated to provide either the new model (27 clinics) or the standard model currently in use (26 clinics). All women presenting for antenatal care at these clinics over an average of 18 months were enrolled. Women attending clinics assigned the new model (n=12568) had a median of five visits compared with eight within the standard model (n=11958). More women in the new model than in the standard model were referred to higher levels of care (13.4% vs 7.3%), but rates of hospital admission, diagnosis, and length of stay were similar. There were negligible differences between groups for several secondary outcomes. There was no cost increase, and in some settings the new model decreased cost. It could be implemented without major resistance from women and providers and may reduce cost.</s><s>Many of the individual components of antenatal care have been studied in randomised controlled trials, but few studies have compared whole programmes of antenatal care. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that a new programme of antenatal care with fewer goal-oriented visits would give an equivalent or better result in the outcomes associated with pregnancy and delivery. The new programme consisted of fewer but more objectively oriented visits and fewer procedures per visit. Seven primary care clinics were randomly assigned to the two programmes-three to the standard programme and four to the new programme. 97% of the women were followed up, 9,394 who had followed the new programme, and 6,138 from clinics with the standard one. The proportion of antenatal referrals was also lower (13.6 vs 15.3%; odds ratio 0.87 [95% CI 0.79-0.95]) because of significantly fewer referrals for pregnancy-induced hypertension (2.5 vs 3.8%; 0.66 [0.55-0.79]).

Patients undergoing prior radiotherapy or chemotherapy were excluded from the study. Patient characteristics were as follows (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor vs placebo): median age, 59 versus 54 years; pT4, 16% versus 23%; pN2/3, 68% versus 59%; stage IV, 79% versus 68%. Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor during radiotherapy was feasible and led to significantly shorter radiotherapy duration and trends toward less percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement and mucositis. The unanticipated improvement in survival outcomes warrants further hypothesis-driven investigation and validation.</s><s>The aim of this study was to assess whether amifostine could minimize acute mucositis induced by a very accelerated irradiation regimen in patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The treatment consisted of very accelerated radiotherapy given 64 Gy in 3.5 weeks. Of the 13 patients who received amifostine, definitive interruption of amifostine occurred in 5 cases (38%), due to tolerance problems (vomiting, liver enzyme elevation, generalized erythema). The mean duration of the use of this feeding tube was 1 month versus 2.5 months with and without amifostine respectively (p < 0.01). Local-regional control was not different between both arms with a median follow-up of 15 months. Despite the limited number of patients, this pilot randomized study suggests that amifostine was able to markedly reduce the severity and duration of mucositis induced by very accelerated radiotherapy. However, the tolerance of this twice daily amifostine schedule was relatively poor.</s><s>We wished to determine if filgrastim administration to chemotherapy/radiation therapy-naive patients receiving external-beam irradiation for head-and-neck malignancies would reduce the incidence and severity of oral/oropharyngeal mucositis. Patients were randomized to receive subcutaneous injections of either filgrastim or placebo beginning on day 1 of radiation and continuing daily throughout treatment. No statistically significant between-group differences were seen in mean worst scores across time using repeated measures analysis of variance (Hickey, p = 0.231; WHO, p= 0.288). At almost all timepoints, however, the worst mean scores were lower in patients treated with filgrastim compared with those in patients treated with placebo, and the number of severe (i.e., grade 3) mucositis scores was significantly lower in the filgrastim-treated group.

Mucositis, changes in the oral flora, quality of feeding and changes of total body weight were assessed. In conclusion, selective oral flora elimination in head and neck irradiation patients does not prevent the development of severe mucositis.</s><s>Recently, a randomised study demonstrated the utility of oral cooling (cryotherapy) in the prevention of 5-fluorouracil (5FU)-induced stomatitis. In order to verify these results a confirmatory study, using identical treatment regimen, was initiated. 84 patients treated with a 5-FU-containing regimen were randomised to a control arm or to receive oral cryotherapy.</s><s>To evaluate prospectively the efficacy of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in the reduction of chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis. Twenty patients with stage IV squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck were studied. In the first cycle of PFL chemotherapy, GM-CSF significantly reduced the incidence, mean duration, and mean area under the curve (AUC) of severe oral gross mucositis (grade > or = 3) compared with no therapy. These beneficial effects continued into the second cycle of PFL chemotherapy after crossover to no GM-CSF. There was a significant period effect in favor of giving GM-CSF in the first cycle of chemotherapy.</s><s>Acute mucositis is dose-limiting in many accelerated radiotherapy schedules for head and neck cancer. A study was designed to assess the effect of subcutaneous molgramostin (granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor; GM-CSF) injections on acute radiation morbidity in patients undergoing accelerated radiotherapy for laryngeal cancer. Patients were randomized to receive 150 microg (approximately 2 microg kg(-1)) GM-CSF subcutaneously once daily for 14 days after the second week of radiotherapy, or no GM-CSF. Patients were assessed weekly for grade of mucositis, skin reactions and related parameters. Three developed influenza type symptoms and in one an allergic reaction was noted.</s><s>Pursuant to a promising report suggesting that an allopurinol mouthwash could have a protective effect against 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-induced stomatitis, the authors performed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study. The mouthwash was administered every hour for four doses commencing with each chemotherapy dose. There were no substantial differences in mucositis attributable to the two mouthwashes in the patients who crossed-over on their second cycle of chemotherapy.</s><s>It is known that IP test with chromium 51-ethylene diaminetetra-acetate (51Cr-EDTA) is a useful tool to assess the mucositis. The aim of this study was to characterize the relationship between the urinary excretion of 51Cr-EDTA and the severity of mucositis, and the effect of OGS on 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (FU/LV)-induced mucositis/stomatitis. Fifty-one patients with advanced or metastatic cancer received FU/LV chemotherapy. IP was assessed via the measurement of 51Cr-EDTA urinary excretion after oral challenge, on days 7 after the discontinuation of chemotherapy. Of the 51 patients, 22 patients received OGS (30 g/day) and 29 received only best supportive care (BSC). In the chemotherapy group, the median (25 percentile, 75 percentile) IP test score was significantly higher than those of the control group [6.78% (4.63, 10.66) vs. 2.17% (1.38, 2.40), P<0.001].</s><s>Acute mucositis is a dose-limiting toxicity of concurrent chemoradiotherapy regimens for locally advanced head and neck cancer. Palifermin (a recombinant human keratinocyte growth factor; DeltaN23-KGF) stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of mucosal epithelium to reduce mucositis in patients receiving intensive therapy for hematologic cancers. This study assessed the efficacy and safety of palifermin in patients receiving concurrent chemoradiotherapy for advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. In a phase II trial, standard radiotherapy was delivered in daily 2-Gy fractions to 70 Gy, or hyperfractionated radiotherapy was delivered in 1.25-Gy fractions twice daily to 72 Gy, over 7 weeks. Future studies should evaluate higher palifermin doses with longer and more standardized assessment of acute mucositis.</s><s>To evaluate the safety of recombinant human keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) when administered with fluorouracil (FU) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Patients (N = 81) received KGF by intravenous (IV) bolus on days 1 to 3, followed by FU 425 mg/m2/d IV bolus plus leucovorin 20 mg/m2/d IV on days 4 to 8. In addition, patients provided daily assessments of oral symptoms using a self-administered questionnaire. These symptoms were dose limiting in three cases (ie, in two of 10 patients treated with 80 microg/kg and in one of eight patients treated with 60 microg/kg). The frequency of grade 2 to 4 mucositis was 43% in patients treated with KGF, compared with 67% in patients treated with placebo (P =.06).</s><s>Radiotherapy for head and neck cancer causes acute and chronic xerostomia and acute mucositis. Amifostine was administered (200 mg/m(2) intravenous) daily 15 to 30 minutes before irradiation. Whole saliva production was quantitated preradiotherapy and regularly during follow-up. Patients evaluated their symptoms through a questionnaire during and after treatment. Nausea, vomiting, hypotension, and allergic reactions were the most common side effects. Fifty-three percent of the patients receiving amifostine had at least one episode of nausea and/or vomiting, but it only occurred with 233 (5%) of 4,314 doses.</s><s>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) mouthwashes in the prevention of severe mucositis induced by high doses of chemotherapy. Ninety consecutive patients affected by solid tumors and undergoing high-dose chemotherapy with autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation rescue were randomized to receive placebo versus GM-CSF mouthwash 150 micro g/day. Both study and control groups were compared with respect to the frequency [30% versus 36%, chi(2) exact test, not significant (NS)] and mean duration (4.8 +/- 4.7 versus 4.4 +/- 2.7 days, t-test, NS) of severe stomatitis (grade > or =3). We did not find any evidence to indicate that prophylaxis with GM-CSF mouthwash can help to reduce the severity of mucositis in the setting of the patients we studied.</s><s>The authors previously reported that 30 minutes of oral cryotherapy inhibits 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-induced stomatitis. The current trial was designed to determine whether a longer duration of cryotherapy would provide additional protection. The authors continue to recommend the use of 30 minutes of oral cryotherapy for patients receiving bolus intensive courses of 5-FU-based chemotherapy.</s><s>Between October 1988 and December 1990, 60 patients with leukaemia (25 with AML, 19 ALL and 16 CML) undergoing BMT were randomised in a double-blind clinical trial to receive prostaglandin E2 (PGE) (Prostin E2, 0.5 mg per tablet) or placebo for prophylaxis of oral mucositis. Patients had to dissolve tablets in the mouth three times daily starting 7 days before BMT and continuing until 21 days after BMT. The duration of severe mucositis did not differ between PGE and placebo groups (chi-square 0.95, p = NS).</s><s>The mucosal protective effect of sucralfate (Ulcogant) was evaluated in a prospective randomised clinical study during radiation therapy. Twenty-four patients received 1 g of a sucralfate suspension 4 times a day orally for 5 min each. This group was compared with a control group of 21 patients receiving standard oral hygiene consisting of frequent tooth cleaning and disinfection of the oral and pharyngeal mucosa. Mucosal reactions, pain and difficulty in swallowing were recorded twice a week. The patients showed significant differences in all parameters, and lower weight loss compared with the control group.</s><s>Mucositis is a prominent dose-limiting toxicity associated with 5-FU-based chemotherapy. On the basis of preliminary data suggesting that the amino acid glutamine could alleviate this problem, the authors developed this trial. Patients in both groups were given oral cryotherapy before chemotherapy and were evaluated for mucositis by standard physicians' evaluation and by a self-report instrument. There were no significant differences or substantial trends in the mucositis scores between the two study arms as measured by either the physicians or the patients. It was concluded that the dose and schedule of glutamine used in this clinical trial does not alleviate 5-FU-induced mucositis.</s><s>In this study, the ability of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to treat or prevent chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis in patients with advanced breast cancer was evaluated. G-CSF therapy reduced both the incidence and duration of ADM-induced oral mucositis, and a positive correlation was also seen between the incidence of mucositis and ADM-induced leukopenia (< 2,000/mm3). Group A was further divided into two subgroups according to whether G-CSF was given after or before the leukopenia had dropped below 2,000/mm3: group A-1 (n = 3) and group A-2 (n = 4), respectively. These results strongly support the idea that G-CSF can effectively treat and prevent ADM-induced oral mucositis.</s><s>In some clinical situations the endogenous production of glutamine may be insufficient to maintain optimal tissue structure and function such that glutamine becomes a conditionally essential amino acid. Studies in laboratory animals have demonstrated that glutamine supplementation can reduce the incidence and severity of cytotoxic-induced mucositis. Twenty-eight patients with gastrointestinal cancers were randomised to receive 16 g of glutamine per day for 8 days, or placebo, in a randomised double-blind trial before crossing over to the alternative supplement during the second treatment cycle.</s><s>This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of recombinant human intestinal trefoil factor (rhITF) administered as topical oral spray for prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis (OM). Patients were assessed on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, and 21 (+/- 2 days for the last assessment) for safety and for OM incidence and severity. Assessment of the area under the curve revealed statistically significant reductions in OM severity in the rhITF-treated groups versus placebo. The incidence of TEAEs was not significantly different among treatment groups. Future clinical study is planned to develop this drug for use in OM management in patients with cancer.</s><s>Amifostine has a potential role for salivary gland protection in head and neck cancer patients who had radiotherapy. Sixty-seven head and neck cancer patients were randomized to receive radiotherapy or radiotherapy plus Amifostine. Amifostine significantly reduced the mean questionnaire scores from 6.49 to 3.73, the incidence of grade > or = 2 mucositis from 75% to 36% and acute xerostomia from 82% to 39%.</s><s>Considerable buccal toxicity of radiotherapy or chemotherapy in cancer patients to become discouraged and can affect their quality of life. At present, there is no clinically appropriate prophylaxis efficacious antidote for mucositis. The patients were divided based on computer generated randamosization into laser (study group) and control groups with 25 patients in each group. Both study and control groups were comparable in terms of site of the lesion, stage of the cancer and histology. All patients tolerated the laser treatment without any adverse effect or reactions. At the end of radiotherapy (after 6 wk) mean pain sure and mucositis grade were significantly lower (P<0.001) in the study group compared to control.</s><s>Although a number of compounds have been tested for prophylaxis of oral mucositis, few of them are satisfactory. Patients were randomly assigned to receive polaprezinc (n = 16) or azulene oral rinse as the control (n = 15). On the other hand, tumor response rate in patients with neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy was not significantly affected by polaprezinc, in which the response rate (complete plus partial response) was 88% for polaprezinc and 92% for control (p = 1.000).</s><s>Based on in vitro and on clinical evidence of protection against acute side effects of radiation, a prospective randomized, open study was performed to determine the efficacy of an oral proteolytic enzyme preparation in patients with head and neck cancer receiving conventional fractionated radiation therapy. Patients assigned to the test group arm additionally received enzyme tablets orally t.i.d. starting 3 days prior to radiation therapy, and continuing up to 5 days after completion of the course of radiation therapy. Acute radiation side effects were described as mucositis, skin reaction, dysphagia, and were graded at each visit during and after radiation therapy, following RTOG/EORTC criteria. The duration of these side effects as well as the sum scores of side effects were also less in the study arm. Combination of enzyme therapy with conventional fractionated radiation therapy was feasible and well-tolerated.</s><s>To evaluate the safety of repifermin (keratinocyte growth factor-2) administered before and after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT). Clinical evaluations of mucositis were scheduled before auto-HSCT conditioning regimen, on the day of transplant, and three times per week until mucositis resolved. In general, the incidence of adverse events was similar for patients treated with repifermin and placebo. No clinically meaningful differences were noted among treatment groups for clinical laboratory variables. Results of other endpoints, including pain on swallowing and use of pain medication specifically for mucositis, suggested a better outcome for patients in the 50 microg/kg group compared with the placebo and 25 microg/kg groups.</s><s>A randomized study was conducted to evaluate the protective activity of amifostine (A) against the dose-limiting toxicities of radiochemotherapy (RCT). Patients with head and neck cancer received radiotherapy (2 Gy/day 5 days a week up to 60 Gy) with carboplatin 70 mg/m2 on days 1-5 and 21-25 inclusive. Patients either received RCT alone (n = 14) or RCT + A at a dose of 500 mg prior to treatment with carboplatin (n = 25). The incidence of grade 2 late xerostomia at 12 months is 16.7% and the incidence of loss of taste is 0% in patients treated with A, as opposed to 54.5% and 63.6% in patients who received RCT alone. The use of amifostine reduces the incidence and severity of acute and late toxicities associated with RCT whilst preserving antitumour activity.</s><s>Several chemotherapeutic regimens and radiation therapy, if delivered to the oral mucosa, are associated with a high frequency of mouth lesions. The cause of this side effect is not known for certain, but in past studies it has sometimes been associated with the ability to culture herpes simplex virus type 1 from the mouth. However, there were no differences in the frequency or type of mouth lesions experienced by patients receiving either radiation or chemotherapy who were taking acyclovir or placebo.</s><s>Forty patients with multiple myeloma scheduled to receive melphalan 200 mg/m(2) followed by autologous stem cell transplantation were randomly assigned to receive oral cryotherapy or room temperature normal saline rinses 30 min before and for 6 h after high-dose therapy. Patients self-scored their pain, swallowing, drinking, eating, sleeping and taste alterations for 28 days. Compared to the normal saline group, patients using cryotherapy experienced less grade 3-4 mucositis, 14 vs 74%, P=0.0005. Patient-reported pain was significantly lower and activities were significantly better in the cryotherapy group.</s><s>Although intravenous administration is the standard route, pharmacokinetic studies have shown acceptable plasma levels of the active metabolite of amifostine (WR-1605) after subcutaneous administration. The subcutaneous route, due to its simplicity, presents multiple advantages over the intravenous route when amifostine is used during fractionated radiotherapy. A flat dose of amifostine 500 mg, diluted in 2.5 mL of normal saline, was injected subcutaneously 20 minutes before each radiotherapy fraction. In approximately 5% of patients, amifostine therapy was interrupted due to cumulative asthenia, and in 10%, due to a fever/rash reaction. The delays in radiotherapy because of grade 3 mucositis were significantly longer in the group of patients treated with radiotherapy alone (P <.04). Subcutaneous administration of amifostine is well tolerated, effectively reduces radiotherapy's early toxicity, and prevents delays in radiotherapy.</s><s>We evaluated the efficacy of benzydamine oral rinse for prevention of radiation-induced mucositis. Intensity of mucositis increased up to fourth week of treatment in both groups to grade 2. In the treated group the grade of mucositis was approximately constant to the end of therapy; but in the control group it raised to grade 3 (P < 0.001). The highest grade of mucositis during the treatment time was significantly different between two groups (P = 0.049).</s><s>We performed this double-blinded, placebo-controlled study to determine the safety and efficacy of L-alanyl-L-glutamine in the prevention of mucositis in patients with head-and-neck cancer. Mucositis was assessed by the Objective Mucositis Score (OMS) and the World Health Organization (WHO) grading system. The number of patients with severe objective mucositis (OMS >1.49) was higher in the placebo group compared with the L-alanyl-L-glutamine group (67% vs. 14%, p = 0.007). No adverse effects related to the drug or the infusions were noted in either group.</s><s>Mucositis is a major complication in myeloablative therapy, which often necessitates advanced pharmacological pain treatment, including i.v. Attempts to prevent oral mucositis have included oral cryotherapy, which has been shown to reduce mucositis, but there is a lack of knowledge concerning the effect of oral cryotherapy on opioid use by reducing the mucositis for patients treated with myeloablative therapy before bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Eighty patients 18 years and older, scheduled for BMT, were included consecutively and randomised to oral cryotherapy or standard oral care. In the autologous setting, cryotherapy patients also needed significantly lower total dose of opioids.</s><s>Na sucrose octasulfate (Na SOS) was tested for ability to relieve radiation-induced acute skin and mucosal reactions in patients with head and neck cancer. Sixty patients were included in this prospective, double-blind, randomized study. In conclusion, we cannot recommend Na SOS in the routine management of radiation-induced skin and mucosal reactions.</s><s>Benzydamine hydrochloride rinse was shown to prevent oral mucositis in radiation therapy.</s><s>To prepare and evaluate an allopurinol mouth rinse for prophylaxis of fluorouracil-induced mucositis, 33 patients with malignant disorders, who were going to receive 5-fluorouracil containing chemotherapy, were enrolled in a placebo-controlled double-blinded randomized clinical trial. A questionnaire consisting of demographic parameters, medical status, quality of life survey and mucosal injury scoring table (based on World Health Organization scales for mucositis) was completed for each patient at Day 1, 3 and 7 after chemotherapy. Mean ages were 56.9 +/- 10.3 and 49.5 +/- 13.8 years in allopurinol and placebo groups respectively (P = 0.107).</s><s>Low-power laser to prevent oral mucositis in autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.</s><s>The effects of chlorhexidine mouthrinses, used as a supplement to mechanical oral hygiene measures, were studied in patients receiving treatment for acute leukemia. Chlorhexidine had no effects of any clinical significance on parameters such as number of days with fever, number of oral lesions, plaque score, gingival bleeding score, or occurrence of candidiasis. There was, however, an increased number of patients who had a burning sensation in the mouth, and a tendency toward increased numbers of salivary enterococci, enterobacteria, and/or Pseudomonas in patients who rinsed with chlorhexidine.</s><s>In this prospective multicentre trial, 90 patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) were randomised to receive (n=43) or not receive (n=47) amifostine 910 mg/m(2) prior to melphalan 200 mg/m(2). Patients were monitored for regimen-related toxicity, engraftment, supportive care, response and survival. Amifostine infusional side-effects were frequent, occurring in 65% of patients, but of mild severity. Amifostine use was associated with a reduction in the median grade of oral mucositis (1 vs 2, P=0.01) and the frequency of severe (WHO grades 3 or 4) mucositis (12 vs 33%, P=0.02), but no reduction in the requirement for parenteral nutrition or analgesic use. We conclude that amifostine can be safely administered prior to high-dose melphalan and significantly reduces the frequency and severity of therapy-induced oral mucositis.</s><s>Mouth sores and/or difficulty swallowing are common and painful consequences of cytotoxic chemotherapy for cancer. In previous studies oral glutamine was found to protect animals from the effects of whole abdominal radiation and methotrexate-induced enteritis. Twenty-four patients (16 children and 8 adults) received glutamine or placebo (glycine) suspension (2 g amino acid/M2/dose twice daily) to swish and swallow on days of chemotherapy administration and for at least 14 additional days. Patients completed a calendar indicating days of mouth pain associated with each chemotherapy course and the effect of mouth pain on oral intake. The severity of oral pain also was reduced significantly when glutamine was provided with chemotherapy (the amount of days mucositis restricted oral intake to soft foods [> or =Grade 2; Modified Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group grading system] was 4 days less with glutamine compared with placebo; Wilcoxon's signed rank test, P=0.002). Low dose oral glutamine supplementation during and after chemotherapy significantly reduced both the duration and severity of chemotherapy-associated stomatitis.</s><s>Multiple center randomized controlled double blind clinical trait was conducted to evaluate the anti-radiotherapy effect by SOD (produced by Hunan Biochemical Work) in 159 patients. Injection of 4000U SOD immediately after receiving radiotherapy significantly reduced the occurrence rate of skin, oral mucosal, pelvic visceral and systematic adverse reaction, only the reduction of leukopenia did not reach the statistical significant level.</s><s>To evaluate the influence of oral glutamine on radiation-induced oral mucositis in the radiotherapy of head and neck cancer. Patients were instructed to swish the test solutions (30 ml) four times per day. Mean maximum grade of objective oral mucositis was less severe in the glutamine arm (1.6 vs. 2.6) (p = 0.0058). Glutamine did not reduce the duration and severity of subjective oral mucositis except for duration > or = Grade 3 (p = 0.0386). In the analysis of mean maximum WHO step of analgesic medication, there was no statistical difference (p = 0.5374) between the two arms.</s><s>This study was designed to observe the effect of traditional Chinese medicine against acute oropharyngeal mucositis from chemoradiotherapy in patients with local advanced NPC. A total of 101 patients in stage III- IVa (Fuzhou 1992) were enrolled into this prospective randomized clinical trial. The cases were divided into treatment group (52 cases) and control group (49 cases). (1)Oropharyngeal toxicity: there was no 0 degree oropharyngeal toxicity in both groups, I degree toxicity in 29 cases (55.77%) and 2 cases (4.08%), II degree toxicity in 18 cases (34.62%) and 17 cases (30.69%), III degree toxicity in 5 cases (9.62%) and 22 cases (44.89%), IV degree toxicity in 0 case (0%) and 8 cases (16.33%); there was statistical significance of difference between the two groups (P=0.000). (2)Hematological toxicity: there was no IV degree hematological toxicity in both groups. (4)Curative effects: The curative effects of two groups were:complete remission (CR) 76.92% (40/52) and 69.39% (34/49), partial remission (PR) 23.08% (12/52) and 30.61% (15/49); there was no statistical significance of difference (P=0.392).</s><s>Palifermin reduces mucositis when given in multiple doses to patients undergoing hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. All patients received doxorubicin-based chemotherapy (90 mg per m(2) of body surface area over 3 days, by infusion). Patients who had severe mucositis received open-label palifermin in subsequent cycles. Seven of the 8 patients who had severe mucositis in the placebo group received open-label palifermin. Study limitations include smaller sample size for the control group, inclusion of only patients with sarcoma, and perceived unblinding of the treatment because of notable differences between the biologic effects of palifermin and placebo. A single dose of palifermin before each cycle reduced the incidence and severity of mucositis. The drug was generally well tolerated, but most patients experienced thickening of oral mucosa. Further investigation is needed to determine whether palifermin use will facilitate greater adherence to chemotherapy regimens by reducing mucositis.</s><s>The invasion and colonization of oral cavity mucosal tissues by microflora may contribute to the pathophysiology of ulcerative oral mucositis (UOM). Iseganan is an analog of protegrin-1, a naturally occurring peptide with broad-spectrum microbicidal activity. Patients were assessed for stomatitis and UOM, and administered a questionnaire evaluating mouth pain and difficulty swallowing thrice weekly. Between November 2001 and June 2002, 502 patients were randomized to receive iseganan (251) or placebo (251). Forty-three percent and 37% of iseganan and placebo patients, respectively, did not have peak stomatitis grade =2 (P = 0.182). A major impact of Iseganan on reducing stomatitis, UOM, or its clinical sequelae in patients receiving stomatotoxic therapy was not detected on this study.</s><s>The purpose of this study was to assess the value of sucralfate suspension in prevention of oral mucositis and for reduction of oral pain in patients who develop mucositis during radiation therapy. Early during radiation therapy less oral pain was reported in the sucralfate group, but as treatment progressed all patients experienced pain.</s><s>To determine the prophylactic properties of amifostine against acute and late toxicities from radiochemotherapy in patients with head-and-neck cancer. Amifostine (300 mg/m(2)) was administered in the study group only 15-30 min before RT for 6-7.5 weeks. Secondary end points included treatment duration, hematologic toxicity, and clinical outcome. Acute toxicities (mucositis and dysphagia) were less severe in the amifostine-treated group. By Week 5, 52.2% of the patients in the control group experienced Grade 4 mucositis compared with 4.5% in the amifostine-treated group (p = 0.0006). Cytoprotection with amifostine did not affect treatment outcome, with 90.9% complete responses in the amifostine-treated group compared with 78.3% in the control group (p = 0.414). Amifostine was effective in reducing mucositis and dysphagia resulting from radiochemotherapy in patients with head-and-neck cancer.</s><s>Patients of head and neck cancer undergoing radiotherapy develop oral mucositis. The severity of mucositis may also depend on the time of administration of radiation apart from patient-related factors. The present study evaluated prospectively the severity of acute oral mucositis in head and neck carcinoma patients irradiated in the morning (08:00-11:00 h) versus late afternoon/evening (15:00-18:00 h). The observed incidence of grade III/IV mucositis in morning vs. evening irradiated patients may be because of the existence of circadian rhythm in the cell cycle of normal mucosa.</s><s>The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (AGNB) play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of radiation-induced mucositis; consequently, selective elimination of these bacteria from the oral flora should result in a reduction of the mucositis. Weekly, the objective and subjective mucositis scores and microbiologic counts of the oral flora were noted. No statistically significant difference for the objective and subjective mucositis scores was observed between the two study arms (p = 0.33).</s><s>We tested the ability of palifermin (recombinant human keratinocyte growth factor) to decrease oral mucosal injury induced by cytotoxic therapy. Among all patients, regardless of the occurrence of mucositis, the median duration of oral mucositis of WHO grade 3 or 4 was 3 days (range, 0 to 22) in the palifermin group and 9 days (range, 0 to 27) in the placebo group (P<0.001). Adverse events, mainly rash, pruritus, erythema, mouth and tongue disorders, and taste alteration, were mild to moderate in severity and were transient. Palifermin reduced the duration and severity of oral mucositis after intensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy for hematologic cancers.</s><s>We tested the efficacy of iseganan HCl (iseganan), a synthetic peptide with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, for preventing RT-associated OM. A multinational, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial was performed on patients receiving primary RT, primary chemoradiotherapy or postoperative RT. Patients were randomized to receive iseganan oral solution plus standard-of-care oral hygiene (SOC), placebo plus SOC, or SOC alone throughout the RT administration period. However, patients in both intervention groups reported less mouth pain and difficulty swallowing than did patients receiving SOC alone. Adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation and death did not differ significantly between groups. Iseganan oral solution was safe but did not reduce the risk for developing ulcerative OM relative to placebo. Our results suggest that antimicrobial intervention may not meaningfully affect the pathogenesis of radiation-induced OM.</s><s>To compare subcutaneously given molgramostim (GM-CSF) and sucralfate mouth washings to sucralfate mouth washings in prevention of radiation-induced mucositis. Forty head and neck cancer patients were randomly assigned to use either GM-CSF and sucralfate (n = 20) or sucralfate alone (n = 20) during radiotherapy. The grade of radiation mucositis and blood cell counts were monitored weekly. We found no significant difference between the molgramostim and the control groups in the oral mucositis grade, oral pain, use of analgesic drugs, weight loss, or survival.</s><s>Radiotherapy-induced mucositis decreases the quality of life by impairing eating, swallowing, and talking and by disturbing sleep. The patients were randomized to use either sucralfate mouth washing (n = 18) or placebo washing (n = 10) during irradiation. In sucralfate group, nine patients each had grade 1 and grade 2 with no grade 3 mucositis. Sucralfate mouth washing is beneficial in decreasing the intensity of radiation-induced mucositis and oral discomfort. It is cheap, easy to administer with no serious side effect, and may be routinely used in patients receiving head and neck radiotherapy.</s><s>Radiotherapy of head and neck malignancies is accompanied by oral discomforts, such as epithelitis, pain and functional impairment. Therefore, we investigated the possible ability of sucralfate, an aluminium hydroxide complex of sulphated sucrose used in the treatment of gastric ulcer, in preventing oral discomfort in patients treated with curative intent for malignancies in the head and neck region. The study was double-blind, placebo-controlled and randomized and included 50 consecutive patients.</s><s>Radiation therapy is an important curative modality in the treatment of patients with head and neck cancer. However, radiation-induced changes in the oral cavity, such as xerostomia and mucositis, are among the most debilitating treatment sequelae experienced by patients undergoing radiation therapy, and attempts at ameliorating these side effects have been poor at best. Selected patients were required to have > or = 50% of the volume of the major salivary glands receive > or = 50Gy; to agree to provide stimulated and unstimulated samples of saliva (measured in g) before treatment, at the end of treatment, and 3 and 6 months after completion of radiation therapy; and to complete the University of Washington Head and Neck Symptom Scale. The significant difference in unstimulated salivary flow supports the concomitant use of oral pilocarpine to decrease radiation-associated xerostomia.</s><s>This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase III study evaluated the efficacy and safety of i.v. amifostine 300 mg/m2 (n = 67) or placebo (n = 65) before carboplatin 70 mg/m2 and radiotherapy on Days 1 to 5 and 21 to 25, and i.v. One-year rates of locoregional failure, progression-free survival, and overall survival were not significantly different between treatments. The safety of amifostine and the lack of tumor protection were consistent with previous studies.</s><s>Fifty patients were randomized 25 allocated in enzyme and radiotherapy arm, 25 in radiotherapy alone. In control arm 12% had grade I, 76% had grade II, 8% had grade III skin reaction.</s><s>Effects of clarithromycin on oral mucositis in bone marrow transplant recipients.</s><s>Because all patients receiving bone marrow transplant (BMT) and peripheral blood progenitor cell transplant (PBPCT) experience gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity from the preparative regimen of chemotherapy, with or without radiation, oral glutamine was administered during the preparatory regimen and after transplant to maintain GI structure and function. The trends of decreased median length of stay and the median number of days of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) were seen in the group supplemented with the >0.285-g/kg (the recommended dosage) dose of glutamine; however, there was no statistically significant difference in the nutritional status and overall patient outcome as assessed by days receiving TPN, number of days required until oral intake resumed, length of hospitalization, number of days and highest grade of mucositis, and quantity and number of days of diarrhea. Further investigation is required regarding clinical tools for determining effectiveness, administration for tolerance and compliance, dosage, and potential of oral glutamine usage.</s><s>The purpose was to evaluate prevention of oral mucositis (OM) using chlorhexidine compared with placebo and with oral cooling (cryotherapy) during fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy in gastrointestinal (GI) cancer. Among 225 patients randomized, 206 answered the questionnaire (70, 64, and 63 patients in Arms A, B, and C, respectively) and were well balanced with respect to diagnoses, stage, age, sex, smoking habits, and performance status. Duration was significantly longer in B than in both A (P= .035) and C (P= .003). The frequency and duration of OM are significantly improved by prophylactic chlorhexidine and by cryotherapy. The latter is easy and inexpensive but has limited use, as it is drug- and schedule-dependent.</s><s>Severe oral mucositis is a major cause of morbidity following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT). Cryotherapy, that is, the application of ice chips on the mucosa of the oral cavity during the administration of antineoplastic agents, may reduce the incidence and severity of chemotherapy-related oral mucositis. The incidence of severe (grade 3-4) oral mucositis, the primary end point of the study, was comparable in patients receiving or not cryotherapy. Thus, cryotherapy during MTX administration does not reduce severe oral mucositis in patients undergoing myeloablative allogeneic HSCT.</s><s>Patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy frequently suffer from mucositis, particularly if they become leukopenic (leucocytes <1000/microL). Patients were asked to rinse three times a day for 30s from the beginning of chemotherapy until the end of leukopenia. In the control group, the numbers of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria remained unchanged (P>0.05). Fifteen patients in the chlorhexidine-based group had a C-reactive protein (CRP) increase >50mg/L, compared with only eight patients in the control group [odds ratio: 3.13, confidence interval (CI) 0.82-12.39]. Nine patients in the chlorhexidine-based group but only two patients in the control group developed severe mucositis. The results of the microbial counts were very similar, with a clear reduction in the chlorhexidine group and no major alterations in the control group. Other parameters such as body temperature or application of antibiotics did not differ between the two groups. We conclude that treatment with the chlorhexidine-based product did not provide a clinical benefit for cancer chemotherapy patients.</s><s>To investigate the efficacy and safety of Wobe-Mugos E (proteolytic enzymes) for amelioration of early side effects of radiotherapy for head-and-neck tumors, particularly oral mucositis. The study was a prospective, randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, triple-blind phase III study with parallel groups. For the maximum mucositis scores, no statistically significant differences were found between the placebo and the verum group. The average mucositis score over weeks 1-6 revealed a significant difference in favor of the placebo arm, based on an earlier onset of mucositis in the Wobe-Mugos E group. The present study failed to demonstrate any effect of treatment with Wobe-Mugos E on radiotherapy side effects in patients treated for head-and-neck tumors.</s><s>Twelve patients receiving etoposide 1800 mg/m2 as part of a myeloablative pre-transplant regimen were randomized to receive propantheline 30 mg or placebo orally every 6 h for six doses. There were no differences in tumor response or survival between the two groups. Propantheline may reduce the salivary excretion of etoposide and could reduce its toxic effects on the mucosa.</s><s>Conditioning chemoradiotherapy damages the mucosal barrier of the mouth and throat and often produces severe oral inflammation and infection. In a prospective, double-blind, randomized study, we examined the use of a chlorhexidine digluconate mouthrinse for prophylaxis against oral mucosal complications in 51 bone marrow transplant patients. Use of chlorhexidine mouthrinse produced significant reductions in the incidence and severity of oral mucositis. Five of 27 control group patients (19%) had candidemia, while no candidemia was observed in the chlorhexidine group (p less than 0.03). Prophylactic use of chlorhexidine mouthrinse produces reductions in oral soft tissue disease and oral microbial burden in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation.</s><s>The prophylactic value of twice-daily mouth rinses with a solution of 0.1% chlorhexidine gluconate in minimizing oral complications during remission-induction chemotherapy was tested in sixteen patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia. Standardized measurement indices were employed to assess the dental plaque levels and the degree of gingivitis and mucositis during remission-induction.</s><s>The purpose of this prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study was to evaluate the effect of chlorhexidine 0.1% mouthrinses on oral flora and irradiation mucositis. This study included 30 patients with head and neck cancer who had comparable irradiation portals. One group (N = 15) rinsed four times daily with chlorhexidine 0.1%, the other group (N = 15) with a placebo. The colonization patterns of Candida species, Streptococcus faecalis, staphylococci, and Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, and Acinetobacter species were not influenced by 5 weeks of use of chlorhexidine rinses when compared with the placebo.</s><s>We studied whether GM-CSF applied topically in the oral cavity can prevent or ameliorate this mucositis. In 36 consecutive patients undergoing a stem cell transplantation, we performed a double-blind placebo-controlled study of 300 micrograms GM-CSF in a 2% methylcellulose gel daily versus a 2% methylcellulose gel alone. The primary end-point was mucositis as measured by the WHO toxicity scale for mucositis, oral assessment scale, and a subjective pain scale, all scored daily. The secondary end-points were need to give parenteral nutrition and morphine, incidence of fever and infections, and duration of neutropenia and hospitalization.</s><s>Uncontrolled clinical trials have shown that parenteral administration of GM-CSF reduces the frequency of chemotherapy-induced mucositis. The primary endpoint was to evaluate the relationship between dose of GM-CSF mouthwash received and probability of grade > or = 3 mucositis using a logistic model. Solutions were administered four times daily starting within 24 hours of chemotherapy initiation and continuing until the end of the cycle (day 21). Five patients had a detectable plasma concentration of GM-CSF (56-209 pg/ml).</s><s>A randomized phase 2 study was performed to investigate the efficacy/toxicity of combining concomitant boost radiation and weekly carboplatin/paclitaxel with or without amifostine in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Patients with newly diagnosed, locally advanced stage III or IV SCCHN received 4 weekly doses of carboplatin (area under the curve, 1.5) and paclitaxel (45 mg/m(2)) concurrently with concomitant boost radiation consisting of 72 grays in 42 fractions over 6 weeks (every day for 18 days, twice a day for 12 days) (grading determined according to the TNM staging system). Toxicity data were collected weekly, and saliva collection was performed with and without citric acid stimulation. The majority of patients were men (90%), had stage IV disease (82%), and had the oropharynx as the primary tumor site (60%). Major toxicities encountered were similar in both arms and included grade 3 (as determined by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0) mucositis (75% in Arm A and 70% in Arm B) and grade 2 xerostomia (41% in both arms). The median number of amifostine doses delivered was 28, with skin toxicity (grade 3 in 11 patients) as the limiting factor. Neck dissection was performed in 25 patients; 5 patients demonstrated persistent disease and 4 patients were alive without disease recurrence at the time of last follow-up. Only 1 patient remained percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy-dependent at the time of last follow-up.</s><s>To observe the effect of Yangyin Humo Decoction (YHD) on oral mucomembranous reaction in patients with head-neck tumor undergoing radiotherapy. Forty-Forty-two patients with head-neck tumor undergoing radiotherapy were randomized equally into two groups. Patients were examined every day to observe and compare the degree, initiating time, and repairing time of their oral lesions; the dosage of radiation they received was recorded as well. The degree of mucomembranous reaction that appeared in most patients in the test group was of grade 1-2, while in the control group, it was grade 2-3. The average time for oral lesion of 1, 2, 3 grades to be initiated in the test group was 12.0+/-1.1, 11.0+/-1.3 and 10.0+/-0.8 days, respectively, after radiation started, which was later than that in the control group (P<0.01). The Chinese herbal preparation YHD could alleviate oral mucomembranous reaction to radiation applied in patients with head-neck tumor.</s><s>To test the effectiveness of a nurse-initiated systematic oral hygiene teaching program-PRO-SELF: Mouth Aware (PSMA)-in conjunction with two mouthwashes (0.12% chlorhexidine or sterile water) in preventing chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis. Researchers used the Oral Assessment Guide to assess the patients oral cavities monthly (with the patients cycles of chemotherapy) and when patients reported any oral changes between cycles. Type of mouthwash, incidence, days to onset, and severity of chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis. Interestingly, the PSMA program appeared to reduce the incidence of mucositis from on a prior estimate of 44% to less than 26%. A nursing prescription of a systematic oral hygiene program using water as a mouth rinse is cost efficient and may be effective in preventing oral mucositis.</s><s>Stomatitis has been found to be a major dose-limiting toxicity from bolus 5-fluorouracil-based (5-FU) chemotherapy regimens, despite the use of oral cryotherapy. Patients were entered into the study at the time of their first cycle of 5-FU-based chemotherapy. All patients received oral cryotherapy for 30 minutes with each dose of 5-FU. Stomatitis scores were determined by health care providers and by patients themselves. There were 164 evaluable and well-stratified patients equally randomized to both treatment groups. The resultant data from this clinical trial did not support the prestudy hypothesis that chamomile could decrease 5-FU-induced stomatitis.</s><s>Elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) have been reported to correlate with the development of transplant-related complications after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). In a recent phase I-II trial, oral administration of pentoxifylline (PTX), a xanthine derivative capable of downregulating TNF-alpha production in vitro, was reported to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing BMT. We conducted a prospective randomized trial of PTX therapy among 140 patients undergoing either allogeneic (n = 51) or autologous BMT (n = 89). The incidence of renal insufficiency was not affected by PTX administration (15.7% in the PTX group v 21.4% in the control group [NS]) and the highest serum creatinine value during the first 100 days post-BMT was 119 mumol/L (SD = 82.4) in the PTX group versus 103.9 mumol/L (SD = 57) in the control group (NS). On the basis of these findings, we cannot recommend that PTX be part of early mortality and morbidity prevention programs after BMT.</s><s>Benzydamine was evaluated in patients with head and neck carcinoma for treatment of radiation-induced oral mucositis, a frequent complication of radiation therapy (RT) for which there is no predictable therapy or preventive treatment currently available. During conventional RT, regimens up to cumulative doses of 5000 centigrays (cGy) benzydamine (n = 69) significantly (P = 0.006) reduced erythema and ulceration by approximately 30% compared with the placebo (n = 76); greater than 33% of benzydamine subjects remained ulcer free compared with 18% of placebo subjects (P = 0.037), and benzydamine significantly delayed the use of systemic analgesics compared with placebo (P < 0.05). Benzydamine was not effective in subjects (n = 20) receiving accelerated RT doses (> or = 220 cGy/day). The incidence of adverse events between treatment groups was comparable without significant differences. Benzydamine oral rinse was effective, safe, and well tolerated for prophylactic treatment of radiation-induced oral mucositis.</s><s>Mucositis occurs in almost all patients treated with radiotherapy for head and neck cancer. One hundred thirty-seven eligible patients were randomized to treatment with either antimicrobial lozenge (69 patients) or placebo lozenge (68 patients). The primary end point of the study was the time to development of severe mucositis from the start of radiotherapy. There were no statistically significant differences between the arms in the extent of severe mucositis as measured by physician, in oral toxicities as recorded by patients, or in radiotherapy delays. Whether such a lozenge would be beneficial in treatment situations where rate of severe mucositis is higher (ie, in patients treated with unconventional fractionation or with concomitant chemotherapy) is unknown.</s><s>The modifying effect of beta-carotene on radiation and chemotherapy induced oral mucositis.</s><s>To evaluate the efficacy of pure natural honey as prophylaxis against radiochemotherapy-induced mucositis, through clinical scoring of oral and oropharyngeal mucositis, and culturing of pathogenic oral and oropharyngeal microbes. The study was done in Assiut University Hospital, Egypt, between January 2005 and July 2006. Patients were evaluated clinically every week to assess development of radiation mucositis. In the treatment group, no patients developed grade four mucositis and only three patients (15 per cent) developed grade three mucositis. Candida colonisation was found in 15 per cent of the treatment group and 60 per cent of the control group, either during or after radiotherapy (p = 0.003). This study shows that prophylactic use of pure natural honey was effective in reducing mucositis resulting from radiochemotherapy in patients with head and neck cancer.</s><s>This pilot study evaluates the degree of side effects during high-dose chemotherapy (HD-VIC) plus autologous bone marrow transplant (HDCT) and its possible prevention by the cytoprotective thiol-derivate amifostine. All patients received prophylactic application of G-CSF (5 microg kg(-1)subcutaneously) to ameliorate neutropenia after treatment. Patients were monitored for nephrotoxicity, gastrointestinal side effects, haematopoietic recovery, as well as frequency of fever and infections. The median fall of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 10% from baseline in the amifostine group (105 to 95 ml min(-1)) and 37% in the control patient group (107 to 67 ml min(-1)) (P< 0.01). Amifostine-treated patients revealed a less pronounced increase in albumin and low molecular weight protein urinary excretion. The reduction of acute toxicity observed in the amifostine arm resulted in 30% savings in costs for supportive care (Euro 4396 versus Euro 3153 per patient). Taking into account the drug costs of amifostine, calculation of in-patient treatment costs from the start of chemotherapy to discharge revealed additional costs of Euro 540 per patient in the amifostine arm. This randomized pilot study indicates that both organ and haematotoxicity of HD-VIC chemotherapy can be ameliorated by the use of amifostine.</s><s>Misoprostol, a prostaglandin E(1) analog, is an effective radioprotector in animal studies. Based on this evidence, a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study was conducted to determine if misoprostol protected the oral and pharyngeal mucosa of irradiated head and neck cancer patients from radiation mucositis. Postsurgical patients who had no detectable cancer and who were referred for postoperative irradiation were candidates for this study. In the 17 patients randomly assigned to the misoprostol arm at the Hines VA, no advantage was seen compared to the 17 placebo-treated patients. However, there was significantly less mucositis (p < 0.01, analysis of variance) from weeks 3--6 in the 17 patients treated with misoprostol at Loyola compared to the 18 placebo-treated patients. Several problems in the study were identified at the VA, including adherence to the protocol design. The results of this pilot study suggest that misoprotol may protect the oral and pharyngeal mucosa from radiation-induced mocositis if adequate time between topical administration and radiation is allowed.</s><s>In an open study, the efficacy of povidone-iodine in the prophylaxis of mucositis during antineoplastic radiochemotherapy was determined. 40 patients were randomly assigned to a treatment or control group (each 20 patients). The mean onset of mucositis was after 2.25 weeks in treatment patients and 1.5 weeks in control patients. The mean AUC values were 2.5 in treatment patients and 15.75 in control patients. All findings were statistically significantly different between the two groups.</s><s>Radiation-induced mucositis is an early effect of head and neck radiotherapy. Mucositis can cause ulcers, and patients may experience pain and dysphasia which need treatment. In this randomized single blind (examiner blind) clinical trial 40 patients with head and neck cancer requiring radiation to the oropharyngeal mucosa were randomly assigned to two groups. Twenty patients assigned to the study group received honey, while both the study and control groups received standard head and neck radiation therapy based on a standard protocol. In the study group patients were instructed to take 20 ml of honey 15 minutes before radiation therapy, then again at intervals of 15 minutes and six hours after radiation. Within the limits of this study the results showed the application of natural honey is effective in managing radiation induced mucositis. Natural honey is a product with rich nutritional qualities that could be a pleasant, simple, and economic modality for the management of radiation mucositis.</s><s>Radiation-induced mucositis is an acute reaction of the mucosa of patients undergoing head and neck radiotherapy. There is no consensus on an accepted intervention that significantly reduces its severity. Misoprostol is a synthetic prostaglandin E1 analogue, with properties of a mucosal cytoprotectant. We designed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of misoprostol in patients with head and neck cancer. The aim of this study was to determine if topical misoprostol was effective in reducing the severity of radiation-induced mucositis in patients receiving radical dose radiotherapy. Most patients received radiotherapy in the adjuvant setting (52 of the 83) and had either an oral cavity (42 of the 83) or an oropharyngeal (16 of the 83) cancer. We could not identify any significant difference in the incidence of severe mucositis based on whether patients were allocated to receive misoprostol or placebo. There was no significant difference in the mean area under the mucositis curve (13.2 vs 16.6; P = 0.1).</s><s>The objective severity of mucositis, anorexia, and swallowing difficulty were measured before and after the treatment. Group 1 served as controls with only normal saline, and group 2 as the indigowood root (IR) group. Patients' characteristic distribution of gender, age, diagnosis, and mean radiation dose between the two arms were calculated by Fisher's exact test. We compared the mean of grade 1-4 mucositis, anorexia, difficulty in swallowing, and body weight change with the Mann-Whitney U test. We confirmed that indigowood root has anti-inflammatory ability to reduce the mucosal damage caused by radiation. We postulate that indirubin may play a pharmaceutical role in improvement of radiation mucositis, anorexia, and difficulty in swallowing in our clinical trial.</s><s>Antimicrobial solutions are widely used in the nursing care of chemotherapy induced oral mucositis (OM). There is little evidence, however, supporting their use for reducing mucosal damage. The study groups were well balanced in respect of age, sex, chemotherapy and the number of CD34+ cells in the graft. No significant difference was found between the groups in respect of OM characteristics, fever of unknown origin (FUO) and other infections. The mechanical effect of mouthwashes might have a certain importance in FUO prevention.</s><s>The effect of parenteral glutamine dipeptide (Gln) supplementation on neutrophil phagocytosis, superoxide anion generation (SAG), prevention of chemotherapy-induced side-effects and cost-effectiveness was examined in a pilot study of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients receiving chemotherapy. Patients were observed for development of infection, mucositis and diarrhoea. In Gln-treated patients, the percentage of neutrophil phagocytosis and the SAG levels were significantly higher than in control patients (20.5 +/- 6.0% and 18.9 +/- 2.9 nmol/10(6) neutrophils per 10 min, respectively). The Gln-treated patients lost significantly less weight, tended to have shorter in-patient duration and had less severe oral mucositis than controls. Parenteral Gln may also prevent oral mucositis, although further studies involving more patients need to be undertaken to confirm this and the other results.</s><s>This study sought to determine whether sucralfate prophylaxis during a course of high dose radiation therapy (RT) for head and neck cancer decreases acute side effects. Patients were stratified according to fractionation, use of concurrent chemotherapy, Karnofsky performance status (KPS), age, and pretreatment presence of a feeding gastrostomy. Sixty-nine patients received BID fractionation and 27 received concurrent chemotherapy. No difference was detected in any outcome measure in the direct comparison between the two groups. On multivariate analysis, weight loss >5% or >10% occurred more frequently in patients receiving chemotherapy (p < 0.01 and p = 0.05, respectively).</s><s>Use of the low-energy helium-neon laser (LEL) appears to be a simple atraumatic technique for the prevention and treatment of mucositis of various origins. Activation of epithelial healing for LEL-treated surfaces, the most commonly recognized effect, has been confirmed by numerous in vitro studies. The mechanism of action at a molecular and enzymatic level is presently being studied. Technical specification: 60 mW (25 mW at Reims, 1 patient), He-Ne, wavelength 632.8 nm. Patients were randomized to LEL or placebo light treatment, starting on the first day of radiotherapy and before each session. Objective assessment of the degree of mucositis was recorded weekly by a physician blinded to the type of treatment, using the WHO scale for grading of mucositis and a segmented visual analogue scale for pain evaluation. Grade 3 mucositis occured with a frequency of 35.2% without LEL and of 7.6% with LEL (P<0.01). LEL therapy is capable of reducing the severity and duration of oral mucositis associated with radiation therapy. In addition, there is a tremendous potential for using LEL in combined treatment protocols utilizing concomitant chemotherapy and radiotherapy.</s><s>To compare granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) mouthwashes with sucralfate mouthwashes in the prevention of radiation-induced mucositis. Forty patients with radically operated head-and-neck cancer were randomly allocated to use either GM-CSF (n = 21) or sucralfate (n = 19) mouthwashes during postoperative radiotherapy (RT). A minimum of 50% of the oral cavity and oropharyngeal mucosa was included in the clinical target volume. GM-CSF mouthwashes consisted of 37.5 microg GM-CSF and sucralfate mouthwashes of 1.0 g of sucralfate distilled in water. Both washes were used 4 times daily, beginning after the first week of RT and continued to the end of the RT course. Complete (n = 1) or partial (n = 4) healing of mucositis occurred during the RT course in 5 patients (24%) in the GM-CSF group and in none of the patients in the sucralfate group (p = 0.049). The present findings need to be confirmed before adopting GM-CSF mouthwashes in routine clinical use.</s><s>Experimental and clinical data suggest a reduction of radiation-induced acute toxicity by amifostine (A). 56 patients with oro-/hypopharynx or larynx cancer (T1-2 N1-2 G3, T3-4 N0-2 G1-3) were randomized to receive RC + CT alone or RC + CT + A. Acute toxicity was evaluated according to the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC). As for acute xerostomia, patients with laryngeal cancer were excluded from evaluation. 50 patients were evaluable (25 patients in the RC + CT, 25 patients in the RC + CT + A group). According to our results, there is a radioprotective effect on salivary glands and a potential effect on oral mucosa by amifostine in postoperative radiotherapy combined with carboplatin.</s><s>Mucositis is still a leading side effect of high dose chemotherapy and irradiation delivered in autologous and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Treatment was started one day before conditioning regimen and patients were prospectively evaluated. Interestingly, patients receiving sucralfate showed a significant reduction of diarrhoea (25%) vs. 53%, P = 0.005). Overall, the preventive administration of sucralfate appears to be an effective procedure to diminish the occurrence of severe oral and intestinal mucositis in patients treated by high dose chemotherapy alone or combined with TBI before bone marrow transplantation.</s><s>Between February 1986 and November 1989, 166 patients who were candidates for a bone marrow transplantation entered a randomised controlled clinical trial to compare limited oral hygiene care (LIM) and intensive oral hygiene care (INT) in the prevention of mucositis. Intensive oral hygiene care included an initial treatment of dental lesions and tooth and gum brushing during aplasia. Limited oral hygiene care excluded preventive dental treatment and gingival and tooth brushing. Mucositis was classified as absent, mild, moderate or severe, according to the clinical aspects of the different sites in the mouth and to two scales of pain evaluation. The superiority of intensive oral care was observed both in patients with and without total body irradiation (TBI) and in patients with a good or bad IOS; the observed risk of mucositis was reduced by 70% in each of these four subgroups. We conclude that, although statistically significant, the superiority of intensive oral hygiene care is not clinically impressive.</s><s>We investigated the clinical effects of low-power laser therapy (LPLT) on prevention and reduction of severity of conditioning-induced oral mucositis (OM) for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). We randomized 38 patients who underwent autologous (AT) or allogeneic (AL) HSCT. A diode InGaAlP was used, emitting light at 660 nm, 50 mW, and 4 J/cm2, measured at the fiberoptic end with 0.196 cm2 of section area. The evaluation of OM was done using the Oral Mucositis Assessment Scale (OMAS) and the World Health Organization (WHO) scale. In the LPLT group, 94.7% of patients had an OM grade (WHO) lower than or equal to grade 2, including 63.2% with grade 0 and 1, whereas in the controls group, 31.5% of patients had an OM grade lower than or equal to grade 2 (P < .001).</s><s>A randomized control trial study was carried out to evaluate the effect of allopurinol mouth wash on stomatitis induced by chemotherapy in gynecologic patients. Allopurinol mouth wash was prepared for patients to rinse their mouth with the solution 4-5 times daily before and after treatment with anti-cancer drugs. In contrast, stomatitis was observed in only 2 of the 10 patients receiving PF therapy and 2 of the 5 VAC in the allopurinol-treated group.</s><s>A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a sucralfate mouthwash in preventing and alleviating oral mucositis induced by 5-fluorouracil (5FU). Patients were randomly allocated to receive either a sucralfate suspension or a placebo suspension that was identical in appearance. Assessment of mucositis by trial staff underestimated the incidence of this problem. Results of this trial do not support the hypothesis that a sucralfate mouthwash can prevent or alleviate oral mucositis induced by 5FU.</s><s>Mucositis is a significant dose-limiting toxicity associated with fluorouracil (5FU), particularly when it is combined with leucovorin. We hypothesized that oral cryotherapy would cause local vasoconstriction and would temporarily decrease blood flow to the oral mucous membranes. To test this hypothesis, 95 patients scheduled to receive their first cycle of 5FU plus leucovorin were randomized to have oral cryotherapy at the time of chemotherapy administration or to serve as a control group. We now routinely recommend this cryotherapy procedure for our patients receiving daily bolus 5FU plus leucovorin.</s><s>Patients with head and neck cancer were randomized in a double-blind manner to receive 40 mg/day prednisone (n = 32) or placebo (n = 34). A mean 4.4 day reduction was observed in the total elapsed treatment duration for the prednisone arm, 34.3 versus 29.9 days (P = 0.013), which paralleled a significantly lower median total tumour and biologically effective dose (BED) Gy10 in this arm.</s><s>To determine the effect of oral zinc sulphate supplementation on radiation-induced oropharyngeal mucositis in patients with head-and-neck cancer. Thirty patients with head-and-neck cancer were randomly assigned to receive either zinc sulfate or placebo. The patients were treated with telecobalt radiotherapy at conventional fractionation (2 Gy/fraction, five fractions weekly, for 20-35 fractions within 4-7 weeks). In the zinc sulfate group, Grade 3-4 mucositis was not detected in any patient; Grade 0 mucositis was detected in 2, and Grade 1 in 8, and Grade 2 in 5 patients. These results should be confirmed by additional evaluation in randomized studies with a larger number of patients.</s><s>We have studied whether mouth-swishing with sucralfate, a well-known gastric mucosal protective agent, may be used as prophylaxis against chemotherapy-induced stomatitis. Using radioactively labelled sucralfate we found that 20-30% was still bound to the oral mucosal lining 2 1/2 h after mouth-swishing. Patient preference favored sucralfate, but this preference failed to reach statistical significance (p = 0.06). Seven patients were inevaluable for reasons not associated with the study treatment. However, ten patients did not complete the study since the swishing procedure aggravated chemotherapy-induced nausea.</s><s>Preliminary studies in allogeneic BMT suggest that recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) is well tolerated. This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. All patients received HLA-identical sibling marrow and cyclosporine and prednisone for GVHD prophylaxis. The time to achieve an absolute neutrophil count of > 0.5 x 10(9) cells/l was shortened in rhGM-CSF treated patients (day 13 vs. 17, P = 0.0001). No differences in platelet recovery, erythrocyte recovery, incidence of veno-occlusive disease, GVHD severity, relapse or survival were observed.</s><s>To observe the therapeutic effect of shenqi fanghou recipe (SFR) in preventing and treating radiation injury in patients with head and neck tumor. One hundred and forty patients with head and neck tumor, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma, carcinoma of tonsil or tongue, were randomly divided into 2 groups, 70 patients in the observed group were given modified SFR as adjuvant to radiotherapy, while 70 patients in the control group were treated with radiotherapy alone. The radiation reactions during radiotherapy and the condition of late stage radiation injury radiotherapy in patients in the 2 groups were observed.</s><s>To characterize the efficacy and safety of palifermin in reducing the incidence of oral mucositis (OM) and diarrhea when administered to patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) receiving fluorouracil/leucovorin (FU/LV) chemotherapy. The incidence of OM and diarrhea, safety, disease progression, and survival were evaluated. Investigators reported lower mucositis scores and patients reported less severe symptoms with palifermin. There were no statistically significant differences in the incidence or severity of diarrhea or in overall survival between the groups. Palifermin administered at the indicated dosing regimen (40 microg/kg for 3 consecutive days) before chemotherapy was well tolerated and resulted in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in the incidence of WHO grade 2 or higher OM in patients with metastatic CRC.</s><s>This study assessed the use of low-energy laser in the prevention or reduction of the severity of oral mucositis. Patients from 3 to 18 years of age treated with chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation between May, 2003 and February, 2005 were eligible. Twenty-nine patients were randomized in the laser group and 31 in the control group. On day 8, of 20 patients (36%) who developed mucositis, 13 of them were from the laser group and 7 from the control group. There was no significant difference between groups concerning the grades of mucositis on day 8 (P = 0.234) or on day 15 (P = 0.208). This study showed no evidence of benefit from the prophylactic use of low-energy laser in children and adolescents with cancer treated with chemotherapy when optimal dental and oral care was provided.</s><s>We evaluated sucralfate, well-known in the treatment of gastric ulcers, in relation to its possible reduction of radiation-induced acute complications in the treatment of head and neck cancers. One hundred two patients were randomized in a double-blind placebo-controlled prospective setting. All patients were scored according to a scoring system developed in our department. This trial produced no clinical evidence indicating that the oral intake of sucralfate reduces the acute radiation-induced side-effects.</s><s>Pilocarpine hydrochloride has been reported to increase salivation and decrease oral mucositis in patients receiving head and neck radiotherapy, but there is only one report of its use in a cancer chemotherapy patient population. This prospective, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was undertaken to determine the efficacy of pilocarpine for the moderation of oral mucositis during autologous blood stem cell transplantation. We recorded the mean and highest scores and duration of problems, along with white blood cell counts and differentials, and the use of systemic narcotics for oral mucosal pain. We enrolled and randomized 36 subjects, and there were no statistically or clinically significant differences for the primary outcome of severity of mucositis and no clinically significant differences in any of the other outcome measures.</s><s>A randomised trial was undertaken to compare the effect of three oral care protocols in delaying the onset of stomatitis and reducing oral injury in nasopharyngeal cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy, 30 eligible patients with a mean age of 56.2 years were recruited and evenly allocated to one of the three groups using a randomly permuted blocks method. We use the Oral Assessment Guide to assess the oral physical conditions of these patients daily.</s><s>Radiotherapy is the usual mode of treatment for unresectable head and neck cancer. In this study, 19 patients received 300 rad/day of radiotherapy in two equally divided doses to a total dose averaging 6,200 rad. The significance of a long-term comparison of cure rates would be doubtful considering the heterogeneity of the primary sites and regional disease in this group coupled with the small size of our study.</s><s>The present study was done to assess the effect of three alcohol-free mouthwashes on radiation-induced oral mucositis in patients with head and neck malignancies. The patients were instructed to rinse with 10 ml of the mouthwash, twice a day, for a period of 6 weeks. Mucositis was assessed at baseline and at weekly intervals during radiation therapy, using the World Health Organization criteria for grading of mucositis. Among the 76 patients who completed the study, patients in the povidone-iodine group had significantly lower mucositis scores when compared to the control group from the first week of radiotherapy. This study demonstrates that use of alcohol-free povidone-iodine mouthwash can reduce the severity and delay the onset of oral mucositis due to antineoplastic radiotherapy.</s><s>We evaluated the efficacy of topically applied human recombinant epidermal growth factor (rhEGF) for the treatment of oral mucositis induced by radiotherapy (RT), with or without chemotherapy, in patients with head and neck cancer. Patients receiving definitive chemoradiotherapy, definitive RT, or postoperative RT to the oral cavity or oropharynx were recruited from 6 institutions and enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial. Patients were assigned to a placebo group or to 1 of 3 EGF-treatment groups (10, 50, or 100 microg/mL doses, delivered in a spray, twice daily). Responders to EGF were defined as having an RTOG grade of 2 or lower at the fourth- or fifth-week examinations during RT, but an enduring RTOG grade 2 for 2 weeks was an exception.</s><s>This phase III randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study was designed to compare the ability of 2 different low level GaAlAs diode lasers (650 nm and 780 nm) to prevent oral mucositis in HCT patients conditioned with chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. The 650 nm wavelength reduced the severity of oral mucositis and pain scores. Low level laser therapy was well-tolerated and no adverse events were noted. While these results are encouraging, further study is needed to truly establish the efficacy of this mucositis prevention strategy.</s><s>To determine whether a chlorhexidine mouthwash could alleviate radiation-induced oral mucositis. Both groups were then similarly evaluated for mucositis and mouthwash toxicity. In contrast to the prestudy hypothesis that a chlorhexidine mouthwash might provide benefit for patients receiving radiation therapy to the oral mucosa, this study provides strong evidence suggesting that a chlorhexidine mouthwash is detrimental in this clinical situation.</s><s>With the progression of radiotherapy techniques, the 5-year overall survival rate of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients has increased obviously. This study was to explore the role of individual dental stent in sparing normal oral tissues for primary NPC patients in radiotherapy by pushing the tongue and a part of oral mucous membrane away from the radiation fields. A total of 43 patients were randomized into 2 groups: 19 in trial group and 24 in control group. Trial group wore dental stent during radiotherapy, while control group did not. By the completion of radiotherapy, 4 (21.05%) patients in trial group and 19 (79.17%) in control group suffered from taste dysfunction (P<0.001).</s><s>In view of the good results obtained with benzydamine against oral radio-chemomucositis in a previous trial, a double-blind/placebo study was undertaken in order to ascertain the possible oral histoprotective effect of benzydamine mouthwash during the intra-arterial polychemotherapy and/or radiotherapy for neoplasms of the head and neck.</s><s>Sixty patients with breast cancer were randomly assigned to oral glutamine or placebo pre-neoadjuvant chemotherapy (CEF regimen). The plasma glutamine level was significantly higher in the glutamine group than in the placebo group (420.39 +/- 52.39 mmol/L vs 309.76 +/- 42.34 mmol/L, P < 0.05). No differences were observed in the grades of stomatitis and diarrhea, in the changes in tumor size, and in the expression of Ki-67 and PCNA antigens between the two groups.</s><s>The properties of saliva led us to hypothesize that the salivary flow increase induced by gum chewing might protect the oral mucosa from lesions due to cancer chemotherapy. Patients were allocated at random to standard oral care with or without 5 gum pieces per day. VIDE, COPADM, and multidrug intensive chemotherapy caused severe oral mucositis in 75% of patients in both arms. In the multivariate analysis, the risk of oral mucositis was related only to the type of chemotherapy regimen, suggesting that further strategies for preventing oral mucositis could be mainly based on these criteria.</s><s>The efficacy of orally administered sucralfate suspension in preventing and treating chemotherapy-induced mucositis was evaluated in a double-blind trial. Forty-eight children and adolescents with newly diagnosed acute nonlymphocytic leukemia were randomized to receive suspensions of either sucralfate or placebo orally every 6 hours during the first 10 weeks of intensive remission-induction chemotherapy. Ten episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding, 25 documented infections, and 886 days with fever were also equally distributed between sucralfate and placebo groups. We conclude that sucralfate suspension is of limited, if any efficacy, in the prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced mucositis.</s><s>From April 1993 to September 1993, 15 patients with lymphoid or solid neoplasms underwent 16 non-cryopreserved peripheral stem cell transplantation courses using the ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide) program. The active drug or placebo administration began jointly with chemotherapy at day -4 and was continued until day 16. We found no differences regarding myelosuppression, infections or other chemotherapy complications.</s><s>Mucositis, the inflammation and necrosis of mucosal membranes, is a serious and debilitating consequence of many cancer therapies. We were interested in the potential role of filgrastim (recombinant methionyl human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, r-metHuG-CSF) in the reduction of mucositis. During cycle 1, placebo-treated patients had more episodes of mucositis (47%) compared with those patients randomized to filgrastim (28%). Across all cycles of treatment, 70% of placebo-treated patients experienced mucositis, compared with 53% of patients randomized to filgrastim.</s><s>Stomatitis is a common consequence of chemotherapy and a condition for which there is little effective treatment. Although the management of patients with other chemotherapy-related toxicities has improved in recent years, the incidence of stomatitis is increasing because of more intensive treatment and is often a dose limiting factor in chemotherapy. A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial was conducted in 32 patients ages 3-25 years who had undergone allogeneic (16 patients) or autologous (16 patients) stem cell transplantation. Stomatitis worsened in only 7 patients (47%) in the TRAUMEEL S treatment group compared with 14 patients (93%) in the placebo group. This study indicates that TRAUMEEL S may reduce significantly the severity and duration of chemotherapy-induced stomatitis in children undergoing bone marrow transplantation.</s><s>To evaluate the value of sucralfate mouth washings in prevention of radiation-induced mucositis. Assessment of the degree of radiation mucositis and collection of stimulated saliva samples were done weekly during the therapy. No difference in the visually assessed degree of mucositis or oral pain reported by the patients was found between the study and the control groups. Although the trial produced no direct clinical evidence indicating that sucralfate mouth rinses prevent radiation-induced mucositis, the decrease in the salivary lactoferrin and albumin levels suggests that sucralfate has a slight protective effect on the oral mucosa.</s>"

Children receiving vitamin C had fewer throat cultures yielding beta-hemolytic streptococcus (six versus 13, P less than 0.10), but no difference in overall complicated illness rate (24 versus 25). Children with high plasma ascorbic acid concentrations had longer mean illness (6.8 versus 4.0 days, P less than 0.05) than those with low levels. Vitamin C does not seem to be an effective prophylactic or therapeutic agent for upper respiratory illness.</s><s>The administration of large doses of ascorbic acid in the prevention and treatment of the common cold. II.</s><s>One hundred sixty-eight volunteers were randomized to receive a placebo or a vitamin C supplement, two tablets daily, over a 60-day period between November and February. They used a five-point scale to assess their health and recorded any common cold infections and symptoms in a daily diary. Consequently, volunteers in the active group were less likely to get a cold and recovered faster if infected. Few side effects occurred with the active treatment, and volunteers reported greatly increased satisfaction with the study supplement compared with any previous form of vitamin C. This well-tolerated vitamin C supplement may prevent the common cold and shorten the duration of symptoms.</s><s>Vitamin C prophylaxis in a boarding school.</s><s>Between December 1972 and February 1973, 2349 volunteers participated in a double-blind trial to assess the effect of large doses of vitamin C on the incidence and severity of winter illness. In spite of the eightfold range in daily dose, the three prophylactic-only regimens showed no evidence of a dose-related effect, but the 8 g therapeutic dose was associated with less illness than the 4 g therapeutic dose. There was no evidence of side effects from the 1 and 2 g prophylactic doses of vitamin C, and no evidence of a rebound increase in illness during the month following withdrawal of the daily vitamin supplements.</s><s>Common cold symptomatology and vitamin C.</s><s>Vitamin C and the common cold.</s><s>This study determined whether daily supplementation with 600 mg vitamin C would reduce the incidence of symptoms of upper-respiratory-tract (URT) infections after participation in a competitive ultramarathon race (> 42 km). The duration and severity of symptoms of URT infections reported in the vitamin C-supplemented nonrunning control group was also significantly less than in the nonrunning control group receiving the placebo (P < 0.05). This study provides evidence that vitamin C supplementation may enhance resistance to the postrace URT infections that occur commonly in competitive ultramarathon runners and may reduce the severity of such infections in those who are sedentary.</s><s>Blood ascorbic acid level in bioflavonoid and ascorbic acid therapy of common cold.</s><s>During 7 weeks in the spring of 1973 a double-blind pilot study on 172 children in the age group 8-9 was carried out to test the possible effect of 1000 mg vitamin C daily as a prophylactic agent against common colds. During the autumn of 1973, a main study was carried out on 642 children of the same age. The results were somewhat divergent but, like previously published studies on children, seemed to indicate that the duration and severity of the cold were reduced while, on the other hand, the incidence remained unaltered or indeed increased.</s><s>Self-reported cold data have been analyzed for 95 pairs of identical twins aged 14-64 who took part in a double-blind trial of vitamin C tablets. However, subdivision of the data showed a significant preventive effect of the placebo in the 51 pairs living together and an equal and opposite preventive effect of the vitamin C in the 44 pairs living apart. The reduction of colds in the vitamin C group of the pairs living apart was about 20%.</s><s>The risk of upper respiratory infections (URIs) is increased in people who are under heavy physical stress, including recreational and competitive swimmers. Additional treatment options are needed, especially in the younger age group. The aim of this study was to determine whether 1 g/day vitamin C supplementation affects the rate, length, or severity of URIs in adolescent swimmers. We carried out a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial during three winter months, among 39 competitive young swimmers (mean age 13.8 ± 1.6 years) in Jerusalem, Israel. Vitamin C had no effect on the incidence of URIs (rate ratio = 1.01; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.70-1.46). The duration of respiratory infections was 22% shorter in vitamin C group, but the difference was not statistically significant.</s><s>Evaluation of the efficacy of ascorbic acid in prophylaxis of induced rhinovirus 44 infection in man.</s><s>A randomised controlled trial was carried out to study the effect of 10 g of ascorbic acid taken during the first 2 1/2 days on the symptoms of the common cold. There was no evidence that upper respiratory or general constitutional symptoms were alleviated by ascorbic acid.</s><s>Three hundred eleven employees of the National Institutes of Health volunteered to take 1 gm of ascorbic acid or lactose placebo in capsules three times a day for nine months.

A small, significant, improvement in morning peak expiratory flow rate (P less than 0.03) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (P less than 0.03) was seen but the absolute changes are unlikely to be of clinical importance. Inhaled steroids may have a role in the management of bronchiectasis by reducing cough and sputum production.</s><s>Although corticosteroid therapy might be clinically beneficial for bronchiectasis, very little is known of its effects on the inflammatory and infective markers in bronchiectasis. We have therefore performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effects of a 4-wk administration of inhaled fluticasone in bronchiectasis. There was a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in sputum leukocyte density and IL-1beta, IL-8, and LTB4 after fluticasone treatment. The fluticasone group had one and the placebo group three episodes of exacerbation.</s><s>While exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) levels are reduced by inhaled corticosteroid therapy in asthma, such treatment effect is unclear in bronchiectasis. Stable non-smoking bronchiectasis patients were randomised to receive either fluticasone (1 mg/daily) or identical placebo via the Accuhaler device. Sixty non-smoking patients (38 women; mean age 56.4 +/- 12.7 years) were recruited. There was no significant difference in eNO levels between fluticasone and placebo patients over the study period. It appears that eNO might not reflect the extent of airway inflammation in bronchiectasis.</s><s>The clinical efficacy of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) treatment has not been evaluated in bronchiectasis, despite the presence of chronic airway inflammation. Logistic regression models revealed a significantly better response in sputum volume with fluticasone treatment than with placebo among subgroups of patients with 24 hour sputum volume <30 ml (p = 0.04), exacerbation frequency </=2/year (p = 0.04), and sputum purulence score >5 (p = 0.03).

We also studied if there were any differences in number of days in hospital and emergency visits before and one year after the asthma-school. Patients were randomised to an intervention group (7 men and 13 women) and a control group (7 men and 11 women). Both groups increased their knowledge of the disease and how to treat it, with slightly better results in the intervention group.</s><s>The object of this study was to assess whether another educational technique, educating patients in small groups, would be as effective and as acceptable as individual counselling in improving knowledge about asthma. A specially designed questionnaire was used to assess knowledge and other variables before and after education. There were significant improvements in knowledge scores after both types of education. The results of this study suggest that educating patients in small groups is as effective as individual counselling in improving knowledge of asthma, is acceptable to patients and takes much less time.</s><s>In June 1989, an out-patient clinic for asthma was instituted at Crema Hospital, Italy. Up to November 1994, 430 adult asthmatics were recruited, classified and managed according to the recommendations of the international guidelines. Each group consisted of 5, 10 and 7 patients with mild, moderate and severe asthma, respectively. One year after the end of the school, we could find no differences between the two groups (school versus controls) with regard to the number of urgent care visits (9 vs 9), scheduled visits (22 vs 21) and hospital admissions (2 vs 2).</s><s>The costs and benefits of a planned patient education programme for patients with asthma were evaluated in a controlled trial. The patient education group received a planned patient education programme, performed by a physician, a pharmacist and a nurse over a 6-month period. Changes in the use of resources, productive output and in health status were measured for the patient education group and the control group. The total cost for planning, implementation and evaluation of the programme was 14074 British pounds sterling. The patient education group increased its contacts to general practitioners and the extra costs totalled 252 British pounds sterling. The economic consequences of the implementation programme depend on the specific setup of the local healthcare system, where the programme is applied.</s><s>To compare patients' perceptions of their asthma severity with that obtained by using the guidelines published by the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program's Expert Panel and with functional impairment measured by spirometry and numeric criteria of the American Thoracic Society. We enrolled 323 patients age 18 to 50 years who were members of the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan for > or = 1 year in a randomized control trial of an asthma education program. Office spirometry was performed, and, using the Mini-Wright peak flow meter, patients kept 2-week diaries of at-home recordings of morning and evening peak expiratory flow rates. A clinically significant proportion of asthmatic patients substantially underestimate disease severity and thereby may be at risk of increased mortality or morbidity.</s><s>The effects on self management of asthma of a specially prepared book and audiocassette tape with similar contents were observed in a controlled study of 177 patients with asthma in general practice. Knowledge about the use of drugs was significantly increased in the groups who received the material after three months and persisted after 12 months. Patients in all groups given the material considered that their disability was reduced. The paradoxical result whereby patients learnt more from the tape but preferred the book suggests that a distinction can be made between information that patients need, which may be acquired better from an audiocassette, and information that they want, which may be acquired better from a book.</s><s>The program provided an overview of lung function, the physiologic abnormalities and treatment of asthma, and the approach to common problems encountered by the patients. The efficacy of the program in 62 patients whose mean duration of illness was 17 years was assessed by comparing the level of knowledge of the experimental group immediately after viewing the tape with that of the controls, who had not seen it; the experimental group scored significantly higher than the control group. Retention of knowledge attributed to the program was assessed after a mean interval of 16 months. The main areas in which the experimental group lost knowledge were self-care and drug therapy for asthma.</s><s>Two different patient education programmes for asthma in general practice were evaluated in a controlled trial. One group then received a maximum education programme, a second group received a limited education programme, and a third acted as a control group. In both the intervention groups, understanding of asthma was greater after the trial. These simple informational education programmes were ineffective when applied to a general practice population. Further studies of factors affecting attitudes, beliefs, and actions are needed to improve the advice and support given to asthma patients.</s><s>Computer education for asthmatics: what effects?</s><s>A prospective experimental design evaluated the ability of a series of educational and motivational interventions to enhance self-treatment by adult asthmatics and to reduce use of emergency department services for asthma attacks. After treatment for an asthma attack, subjects were randomly assigned to the following sequential interventions: (1) reinforcement by interpersonal similarity at the time of the emergency visit, (2) recepit of positive written appeals, and (3) follow-up telephone reinforcement. Although the usefulness of the positive written appeal increased when employed by the asthmatic nurse, there were no substantive independent effects of the written message on emergency department use.</s><s>To determine whether a self-management training program decreases emergency department visits and reduces costs for patients with asthma. All patients seen in the emergency departments were given usual medical care and follow-up. Reports based on hospital admissions and emergency room utilization were verified by billing records. The intervention group had significantly fewer asthma-related emergency visits (16 visits per 100 persons) than did the control group (39 per 100 persons); p = 0.0005 for the 12 months of follow-up. The financial analysis showed that the $85/person cost for the educational sessions was offset by the $628/person reduction in emergency room charges.

In addition, all women received calcium supplementation, if necessary, to a calcium intake of 1,000 mg/day. The Provera-treated group showed no change in total body calcium, but there were decreases in radial density (p less than 0.01), metacarpal cortex (p less than 0.01), and spine density (p less than 0.01). The Premarin-plus-Provera group showed no change in spine density, total body calcium, or radial density but had a decrease in metacarpal cortex (p less than 0.01). Compared to placebo, Provera reduced the rate of loss in cortical areas of the skeleton, but not in the spine, which contains more trabecular bone. The low-dose combination of Premarin plus Provera was similar in its effect on bone to that of Premarin alone, suggesting that there may be a synergistic effect of this hormone combination on bone.</s><s>To evaluate three different therapeutic regimens for the prevention of osteoporosis in natural and surgical postmenopausal women who had been found to have rapid bone loss in analytical studies.

This observation provides important insights into the metabolic effects of postmenopausal hormones but is insufficient to recommend the use of hormones for secondary prevention of heart disease.</s><s>Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with estrogen and treatment with bisphosphonates have been shown to increase bone mineral density (BMD) in postmenopausal women. BMD was measured in the lumbar spine and the hip before treatment and at 2 and 4 years after treatment. In 40 patients (10 patients per group), analysis of bone histomorphometry was carried out after 4 years of treatment. For patients treated with ICE, these increases were 7.3% (P <0.001) and 0.9% (P <0.05), and with HRT, the increases were 7.0% (P <0.001) and 4.8% (P <0.01) in the vertebrae and femora, respectively. Patients who received combined therapy had significantly higher BMD in both the vertebrae and in the femora (P <0.05) in comparison with patients who were treated with HRT or etidronate alone after 4 years. In comparison with patients in the control group, there was a trend toward a lower rate of new vertebral fractures in the treatment groups. The combined therapy group did not have a significant height loss, in comparison with the HRT (P <0.02) and the etidronate (P <0.001) groups. This 4-year randomized study showed an additive effect of etidronate and HRT on hip and spine BMD in postmenopausal women with established osteoporosis.</s><s>The effect of cholecalciferol and estrogen-norethindrone treatment on total cholesterol level, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, blood pressure, and body mass index was investigated in 74 postmenopausal women in a double-blind, randomized trial. When this treatment was combined with cholecalciferol, a similar decrease (13%) was observed. The hypocholesterolemic effect was correlated to body mass index in a way that indicated the most pronounced decrease in lean women. The high-density lipoprotein cholesterol/total cholesterol fraction increased by 45% after 1 year of estrogen-norethindrone treatment, while an increase of 25% after 1 year was seen when cholecalciferol was added to the treatment.</s><s>Changes in body composition were investigated in a group of 136 post-menopausal women treated for at least 1 yr with combined oestrogen-progestogen therapy at three different doses, or a placebo. The body composition changes were evaluated using the urinary creatinine excretion rate as an indicator of lean body mass, and the changes in daily creatinine excretion were related to the changes in serum oestradiol and oestrone. The present study suggests that high-dose post-menopausal hormone therapy changes the body composition by increasing the muscle mass and that, since the body weight remains unchanged, a proportionate decrease in the fat mass seems to occur.</s><s>To test the efficacy of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and dietary therapy, compared to dietary therapy, in lowering LDL cholesterol levels among postmenopausal women. A total of 76 postmenopausal women, aged 43-60 years, with LDL cholesterol levels > or = 4.2 mmol 1-1, treated with a lipid-lowering diet. Levels of lipids, lipoproteins, apolipoproteins, fibrinogen and glucose tolerance. No adverse effects on glucose tolerance or on fibrinogen levels were observed. The reduction in LDL cholesterol was positively correlated with initial levels of LDL cholesterol and negatively correlated with body mass index.</s><s>A randomized controlled trial of the effect of oral hormone replacement therapy plus calcium compared with calcium alone on balance, muscle performance and falls was conducted over 48 weeks in 116 post-menopausal women (aged 45-70 years), all of whom had suffered a distal radial fracture during the previous 3 months. Treatment was with Prempak C or Premarin 0.625 mg in the test group with 1 g calcium daily (Sandocal) in both groups. There was no relation between initial levels of oestradiol and any other variable assessed, except body mass. Levels of follicle-stimulating hormone in the test group were in the premenopausal range. The only significant difference was an increase of 4.2% (95% confidence interval 0.7-7.6%) in leg extensor power in the control group (calcium alone) compared with the group treated with hormone replacement therapy. Hormone replacement therapy did not increase muscle performance, improve balance or reduce falls over a year in middle-aged women.</s><s>Administration of estrogen or etidronate has been shown to increase bone mineral density in postmenopausal women. Fifty-eight early postmenopausal women attending metabolic bone disease outpatient clinics were randomly allocated into four treatment groups and monitored for up to 4 years. In addition, group 1 received percutaneously administered HRT (n = 15); group 2, intermittent cyclical etidronate (ICE) (n = 14); group 3, HRT and ICE (n = 15); and group 4, calcium alone (n = 14). In patients who received the combined therapy, bone mineral density was increased in the vertebrae by 10.9% (P < 0.001) and in the femora by 7.25% (P < 0.001) at 4 years. For patients treated with ICE, the increase was 6.79% (P < 0.001) and 1.20% (P < 0.05), and with HRT, 6.78% (P < 0.001) and 4.01% (P < 0.01) in the vertebrae and femora, respectively. This 4-year, prospective, randomized study in early postmenopausal women showed an additive effect of ICE and HRT on the bone mineral density in both vertebrae and the hip. Furthermore, the combined therapy prevented the occurrence of osteomalacia associated with etidronate. This is the first study to demonstrate the effects of etidronate in early postmenopausal women, and the additive beneficial effects of HRT and ICE on bone mineral density.</s><s>Serum lipids and lipoproteins were examined in 44 healthy postmenopausal women every 3 months during 1 year of treatment with either continuous oestrogen-norethisterone acetate or placebo. HDL-cholesterol levels were significantly reduced by approximately 10% in the hormone group but significant reductions of 5-10% also occurred in the placebo group so that differences between the two groups were only significant after 3 months of treatment. Moreover, the low frequency of bleeding with continuous oestrogen-progestogen therapy would make this an appropriate alternative in postmenopausal replacement therapy.</s><s>Serum lipids and lipoproteins were studied in 76 healthy postmenopausal women treated for 1 year with either oestradiol valerate sequentially combined with the anti-androgenic progestogen cyproterone acetate (CPA) or placebo. Combined oestrogen-CPA therapy resulted in significantly reduced levels of total serum cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol at all examinations, but serum triglycerides and HDL-cholesterol levels were similar in the two groups.</s><s>The dose-response effects on serum lipids and lipoproteins were studied in 87 healthy post-menopausal women treated for 1 yr with three different doses of sequential oestrogen/progestogen (4 mg, 2 mg and 1 mg 17 beta-oestradiol cyclically combined with 1 mg norethisterone acetate) or placebo. This was mainly caused by a similar reduction in low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, whereas the changes in high-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were not significantly different from those observed in the placebo group.</s><s>Our purpose was to determine the efficacy of dietary calcium augmentation in the prevention of early postmenopausal bone density loss in comparison with hormonal replacement therapy and placebo. A three-arm parallel randomized trial comparing the influence of placebo, dietary calcium augmentation, and estrogen-progesterone-calcium in 118 women who were within 6 years of menopause was conducted. There was a decline in the extremity/trunk ratio in the hormonal replacement group as a result of a relatively greater increase in the trunk fat mass. There was a rapid rate of loss in lean body mass that was equal among groups. Menopause is associated with a gain in fat mass and a loss of lean body mass, but these changes in body composition are not prevented by hormone replacement therapy.</s><s>Reports from cross-sectional comparisons, nonrandomized prospective studies, and relatively small clinical trials indicate that postmenopausal hormone therapy may slightly decrease the amount of weight typically gained by women during the decade following menopause. Despite this, widespread belief remains that hormone therapy may cause weight gain. The Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin Interventions trial was a 3-yr, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial of 875 women assessing the effects on cardiovascular risk factors of four hormone regimens: oral conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) therapy (0.625 mg daily alone), CEE in combination with medroxyprogesterone acetate (2.5 mg daily), CEE in combination with medroxyprogesterone acetate (10 mg daily on days 1-12), and CEE in combination with micronized progesterone (200 mg daily on days 1-12). In regression models that included weight change as a covariate, none of these differences reached statistical significance. There were no significant differences in weight or girth changes among any of the four active hormone regimens. Factors that were independently associated with smaller increases in girths were: for waist, greater overall activity (P = 0.005) and Hispanic ethnicity (P = 0.02); and for hip, work activity (P = 0.003) and greater alcohol consumption (P = 0.03).</s><s>After menopause the haemostatic balance shifts towards a latent hypercoagulable state. The continuous treatment group had significantly lower final values of fibrinogen, FVII, ATIII, protein S and HCII than the placebo group; the cyclic treatment reduced fibrinogen in comparison with placebo but the difference was not significant.</s><s>The reduction in cardiovascular risk induced by hormone replacement therapy is only partly explained by changes in serum lipids and lipoproteins. As body composition and body fat distribution in particular are independent predictors of cardiovascular disease, we investigated the effect of postmenopausal hormone therapy on body composition parameters directly measured. Sixty-two early postmenopausal women were followed up for 2 years in a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study. We found that combined estrogen-progestogen therapy prevented the increase in abdominal fat after menopause (P less than .05), and that this effect was independent of the effect on serum lipids and lipoproteins.</s><s>To compare the effect of continuous norethindrone acetate (NA)-ethinyl estradiol (EE2) combinations with matching unopposed EE2 or placebo. Bone mineral density increased significantly from baseline (P<.001) in the 1 mg NA-5 microg EE2 and the 1 mg NA-10 microg EE2 treatment groups at each annual assessment. Increased endometrial proliferation and hyperplasia occurred with increasing unopposed estrogen doses. The percentage of change in the ratio of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was positive for all treatment groups. The increase in triglyceride levels associated with EE2 was attenuated with NA-EE2 treatment. Daily treatment with NA-EE2 was well tolerated and protected the endometrium from EE2-induced proliferation and hyperplasia.</s><s>To determine whether hormone treatment of women during the menopause transition induces changes in body weight, blood pressure, lipoprotein levels, antithrombin III activity, and the endometrium. Prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 12-month study, with crossover at 6 months. Excess change from baseline associated with active compared with placebo treatment for all variables; effect of order of treatment. With treatment, there were no differences in overall values for body weight and blood pressure (P > 0.4), and order of treatment had no significant influence (P > 0.3). There were no differences in total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, overall or with order of treatment. Our study provides conclusive evidence that hormone treatment does not produce weight gain in women during the menopause transition.</s><s>This 12-week, double-masked, double-dummy, randomized, parallel-group study compared the efficacy and safety of an estradiol matrix transdermal delivery system (Alora) in two strengths (50-microgram/d estradiol and 100-microgram/d estradiol) with placebo in postmenopausal women who were experiencing at least 60 moderate-to-severe hot flushes per week. The reduction in hot flushes for both active treatment groups remained significantly different from placebo throughout the 12-week trial. Improvement in vaginal cytology profile (maturation index) was observed in both active treatment groups. Serum estradiol concentrations were elevated to early-to mid-follicular levels, in proportion to dose, and the estradiol/estrone ratio remained within the expected premenopausal range. The incidence of estrogen-related side effects was modest but greater in the active treatment groups than in the placebo group: Breast pain was reported in 4.5% of the patients in the 50-microgram/d group, 5.3% of patients in the 100-microgram/d group, and none of the patients in the placebo group.</s><s>To assess the effect of hormonal replacement therapy on lipid changes, measurement of serum total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low density lipoprotein (LDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL), apolipoprotein A-1 (Apo-A) and apolipoprotein B (Apo-B) was performed on 93 postmenopausal women. The results revealed that triglyceride increased significantly more in the non-HRT than the HRT group at 6 and 12 months. The paradoxical changes of triglyceride and HDL might partly be explained by the effect of progestins used in this study.</s><s>Despite decades of accumulated observational evidence, the balance of risks and benefits for hormone use in healthy postmenopausal women remains uncertain. To assess the major health benefits and risks of the most commonly used combined hormone preparation in the United States. Estrogen plus progestin component of the Women's Health Initiative, a randomized controlled primary prevention trial (planned duration, 8.5 years) in which 16608 postmenopausal women aged 50-79 years with an intact uterus at baseline were recruited by 40 US clinical centers in 1993-1998. Participants received conjugated equine estrogens, 0.625 mg/d, plus medroxyprogesterone acetate, 2.5 mg/d, in 1 tablet (n = 8506) or placebo (n = 8102). The primary outcome was coronary heart disease (CHD) (nonfatal myocardial infarction and CHD death), with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome. Estimated hazard ratios (HRs) (nominal 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were as follows: CHD, 1.29 (1.02-1.63) with 286 cases; breast cancer, 1.26 (1.00-1.59) with 290 cases; stroke, 1.41 (1.07-1.85) with 212 cases; PE, 2.13 (1.39-3.25) with 101 cases; colorectal cancer, 0.63 (0.43-0.92) with 112 cases; endometrial cancer, 0.83 (0.47-1.47) with 47 cases; hip fracture, 0.66 (0.45-0.98) with 106 cases; and death due to other causes, 0.92 (0.74-1.14) with 331 cases. The absolute excess risk of events included in the global index was 19 per 10 000 person-years. The risk-benefit profile found in this trial is not consistent with the requirements for a viable intervention for primary prevention of chronic diseases, and the results indicate that this regimen should not be initiated or continued for primary prevention of CHD.</s>"

        "Abstracts": "<s>A prospective randomized study was performed to test the hypothesis that tamoxifen might improve the survival of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to correlate the response of treatment with the expression of hormone receptors. One hundred nineteen patients with advanced and otherwise untreatable HCC were included in a placebo-controlled, single-blind trial. Immunohistochemical tests for estrogen and progesterone receptors were performed on the tumor tissues obtained from 66 patients. There was no difference in the 1-month mortality rates (32.8% vs. 43.1%, p = 0.246) and the median survival (44 days vs. 41 days, p = 0.703) between the tamoxifen group and the control group. Furthermore, the expression of hormone receptors in the tumors did not affect the survival outcome of the patients treated with tamoxifen.</s><s>In 1998, when data of a meta-analysis on tamoxifen in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) had suggested a little advantage for this treatment, we published the results of a multicenter randomised controlled trial, that showed no survival benefit for tamoxifen vs. control. Here we report an updated analysis of the study results 4.5 years after the closure of enrollment. Patients with any stage HCC were eligible, irrespective of locoregional treatment. 496 patients were randomised by 30 Institutions from January 1995 to January 1997. the update of the present study confirms that tamoxifen is not effective in prolonging survivals, both in advanced patients and in those potentially curable and that the CLIP score is able to predict prognosis.</s><s>Thirty-six consecutive patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and chronic liver disease were randomly allocated to two groups: group I included 20 patients who were treated with 10 mg bid. Survival curves in the tamoxifen-treated patients improved significantly when compared with the non-treated group (p = 0.01). Cumulative survival at the end of the first year was 48.5% in the treated patients and 9.1% in controls. Complications of cirrhosis and worsening of the performance status test occurred less in the treated patients than in the controls, but not significantly so.</s><s>This has offered the rationale for evaluating the therapeutic usefulness of estrogen-receptor blockers; it is being debated whether long-term tamoxifen administration improves survival in patients with this neoplasm. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of tamoxifen administration in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. One hundred twenty patients with this neoplasm who were not suitable for surgery, ethanol injection, or transarterial embolization were included in a placebo-controlled trial and randomized to tamoxifen, 20 mg/day per os, (group A, n = 58) or placebo (group B, n = 62). Both groups were similar with regard to sex, age, liver function (Child-Pugh's score, 6.5 +/- 1.4 vs. 6.4 +/- 1.4), baseline performance status, and tumor stage.</s><s>Following reports that specific estrogen receptors could be detected in samples of hepatocellular carcinoma tissue, a prospective randomized controlled trial was undertaken in 59 patients, half of whom received doxorubicin (60 mg/m2 at 3-week intervals) and half doxorubicin and tamoxifen (10 mg twice per day). Response occurred in three (11%) of those patients receiving doxorubicin alone and in four (16%) of those given both drugs.</s><s>A randomized controlled trial of tamoxifen (60 mg/die) versus placebo was performed in patients with cirrhosis and advanced inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma. The survival of patients treated with tamoxifen improved significantly compared to the controls (Logrank-test, p = 0.04).</s><s>In the Asia-Pacific region and elsewhere, almost 85% of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are inoperable at diagnosis and have a dismal prognosis. At higher doses, however, TMX inhibits HCC through ER-independent mechanisms. Three-month survival rates for the P, TMX60, and TMX120 groups were 44%, 41%, and 35%, respectively, with a statistically significant trend difference in survival across the 3 treatment regimens (P =.011). There was a significantly higher risk of death in the TMX120 group compared with the P group (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-1.81). In conclusion, TMX does not prolong survival in patients with inoperable HCC and has an increasingly negative impact with increasing dose.</s><s>To discover whether tamoxifen is able to extend the survival of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, we included 80 patients with cirrhosis and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in order to analyze the influence of treatment with tamoxifen on survival.

        "Abstracts": "<s>The quality of the cervical smear, a decisive factor in the efficacy of population screening, can depend on the sampling method utilized. The results of this study indicate that (1) method B (Cytobrush plus spatula) and method C (Cytopick) give superior results in the preparation of EC+ smears and in the detection of CIN III and thus should be used in population screening programs, and (2) methods A and D should not be used for cervical cytologic sampling in such programs.</s><s>Six hundred fifty-four Papanicolaou smears were studied prospectively to determine the yield of endocervical cells within specific fertility states by technique used. Smears from postmenopausal women had the lowest yield of endocervical cells (32 percent, P less than 0.01). Swabbing excess mucus from the cervix prior to scraping uniformly improved the yield of endocervical cells (70 percent vs 62 percent, P less than .02).</s><s>The ability of Cytobrush and Papaplast to collect endocervical cells in vaginal smears was tested in a prospective randomized comparative study including 107 women. The use of the latter instrument meant that the number of repeat smears necessitated due to the absence of endocervical cells could be considerably reduced, with consequent improvement in the cost/benefit ratio.</s><s>A single blind crossover study compared the traditional Ayre spatula with the new Aylesbury spatula. The same incidence (3.6%) of dyskaryotic smears was found using the Ayre spatula (74/2077) as the Aylesbury spatula (72/2003). Quantitative studies thus showed that the Aylesbury gave no more accurate results than the Ayre spatula.</s><s>The significance of endocervical columnar cells as a high-quality parameter of cervical smears was studied. At the first screening, a significantly higher number of epithelial abnormalities was found in smears with endocervical columnar cells than in smears without endocervical columnar cells. A significantly higher number of abnormal epithelial changes was found on the second screening in smears from women whose smears from the first screening did not contain endocervical columnar cells than in smears from women whose smears from the first screening did contain endocervical columnar cells. The chance of missing an abnormal epithelial change is increased in smears without endocervical columnar cells.</s><s>In a population-based cervical cancer screening program, the performances of five sample takers and their influence on the cellular composition of the smears and the numbers of epithelial abnormalities diagnosed were analyzed. As measured by the presence of endocervical columnar cells, there were remarkable variations in the quality of the smears between sample takers and between years of sampling. There was also a positive relationship between the presence of endocervical columnar cells in the smear and the number of epithelial abnormalities found.</s><s>To determine whether the cytological detection of persistent cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) after local ablative treatment is improved by the use of sampling devices other than the Ayre's spatula. The allocation of which spatula and the order of the first two was randomized. Each patient had a colposcopic examination immediately after the smears were taken. Significantly fewer Ayre's samples contained endocervical cells than Aylesbury samples (47% vs 59%, difference 12%; 95% CI 3%-21%; P less than 0.001), Rocket samples (47% vs 67%; difference 20%, 95% CI; 12%-32%; P less than 0.001) or Multispatula samples (47% vs 76%; difference 29%, 95% CI 19-38%; P less than 0.001). When punch biopsies contained CIN, dyskaryotic cells were seen in 10% of Ayre's samples, 4.3% of Aylesbury samples, 8.3% of Rocket samples, and in no smear taken with the Multispatula. Obtaining a third smear with the Cytobrush did not substantially improve the detection rate of dyskaryosis.</s><s>The results of three quality control measures for evaluating a cytopathology laboratory's performance in the diagnosis of cervical abnormalities are presented. The sensitivities of cervical cytology were estimated to be 95.5% or 93.1% (using two different methods of analysis) for the detection of histologically diagnosed invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix and 60% for the detection of adenocarcinoma and adenosquamous carcinoma of the cervix in 1983. Regular monitoring of the type described, which is both practical and reasonably comprehensive, is recommended for all laboratories.</s><s>Cervical smears should contain endocervical cells to be accepted as adequate for a cytologic diagnosis. Before this study was undertaken, one-third of the smears received in the Cytology Laboratory of Odense University Hospital were inadequate. In an attempt to increase the rate of adequate smears, a randomized study was undertaken to compare the efficacy of the combined spatula-Cytobrush method to that of the spatula-cotton swab method traditionally used by doctors in Denmark.</s><s>It has been demonstrated that combined ectocervical and endocervical sampling techniques will improve the yield. The results demonstrate that combined ectocervical and endocervical sampling significantly increases the number of positive Papanicolaou smears.</s><s>The purpose of this study was to compare smear quality and endocervical cell recovery of four cervical smear sampling devices. Two thousand fifteen patients undergoing routine cervical smears at the University of Tennessee Obstetrics and Gynecology clinics were randomly assigned to a cotton swab-spatula, Cytobrush-spatula, Cervex-Brush, or Bayne Pap Brush. The cytopathology laboratory, blind to method, used specific criteria to grade smears as being optimal, adequate, marginal, or inadequate. No statistical differences occurred among the groups for nonpregnant patients.</s><s>The relationship between technique of obtaining Papanicolaou smears, presence of endocervical cells, and rate of cervical neoplasia was studied by comparing an endocervical and ectocervical nylon brush (Bayne brush), Ayre spatula plus endocervical brush, and spatula plus cotton-tipped swab in a randomized, prospective trial involving 11,061 patients. Clinic records of patients with abnormal cytology were reviewed to determine the pathologic diagnosis. Endocervical cells were identified in 89.5% of smears obtained with the Bayne brush, in 91.5% with the spatula plus endocervical brush, and in 71.1% with the spatula plus cotton-tipped swab (P less than .001). After correction for the influence of age, there remained predictive value with the presence of endocervical cells.</s><s>The Multispatula, which is adjustable to the specific shape of each individual cervix, was compared with the Ayre spatula in 236 patients. Two smears were taken from each woman, one with the Ayre and one with the Multispatula. Disadvantages of the Multispatula are its high price and the sharp edges causing somewhat more pain and bleeding.</s><s>A study was made of the relationship of endocervical columnar cells to the cytologic identification of abnormality in the cervix. A significantly higher number of moderately and severely atypical epithelial changes was found in smears with endocervical cells as compared with smears without endocervical cells.</s><s>The wooden Ayre spatula with an extended endocervical tip was compared with both designs of the plastic Accu-Pap sampler in two series of 100 consecutive patients to compare their adequacy in obtaining samples for cervical cytology.</s><s>The Ayre and the Armovical cervical spatulae were compared in a randomized trial involving 982 women of childbearing age. Red blood cells were more often present in smears taken with the Armovical spatula than with the Ayre spatula.</s><s>The performance of a new ectocervical brush sampler--the Cervex--was compared with the Ayre spatula in 280 paired cervical smears. The Cervex smears were superior in quality of spread, transformation zone sampling in all degrees of cervical patency and in detection of histologically proven epithelial abnormalities, with a false negative rate of 10.9% compared with 20% for the Ayre. Improvement in predictive value was noted in atrophic samples, with increased cellularity and transformation zone representation. Although two-sampler techniques may be used, submission of high quality pan-cervical material from a single sampler onto one slide is economically and organizationally attractive.</s><s>The sampling efficacy of the Ayre and Rocket cervical spatulas was compared in a randomized controlled trial involving 533 women who were attending a colposcopy clinic either for investigation of cytological abnormality or for review after treatment of CIN. No significant difference was found in the proportion of smears containing one or other type of indicator cell or in the yield of abnormal smears. It is concluded that the Rocket spatula offered no advantage when used in these circumstances.</s><s>Obtaining an adequate Papanicolaou smear, as evidenced by the presence of endocervical cells, is paramount in following patients after treatment for cervical dysplasia. The presence or absence of endocervical cells was noted on the cytology report. Overall, the endocervical brush produced significantly more adequate smears than did the cotton swab (86% vs. 74%, P = .0389).</s><s>Four cytology sampling methods were compared in 1063 patients referred for colposcopy with a recent abnormal smear. The presence or absence of endocervical cells in a smear was not significantly associated with any variation in success rate (chi (2)1 = 0.959, P > 0.30). In the latter analysis the trend towards a conventional level of significance was accounted for by the Aylesbury spatula giving a relatively high success rate when endocervical cells were present. The suggestion of advantage for the Aylesbury spatula merits further investigation.</s><s>A prospective study of 402 Papanicolaou smears was done comparing the effectiveness of three techniques in obtaining endocervical cells. The Zelsmyr Cytobrush cell collector yielded the greatest concentration of endocervical cells. More than one half (53.6 percent) of all cell samples obtained with the Zelsmyr Cytobrush produced \"moderate\" or \"large\" concentrations.</s><s>An 8-mo (August 1988 through April 1989) study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of the modified Ayre spatula/Zelsmyr Cytobrush versus the modified Ayre spatula/bulb aspirator in the collection of cells, both normal and abnormal, from the uterine cervix. Of the 192 patients, 149 were premenopausal (15 of whom were pregnant), 12 were perimenopausal, and 31 were postmenopausal. Of the smears prepared with the spatula/Cytobrush (90 cases), only 2 (2.2%) lacked endocervical cells. Within this group, the smears of 5 of 5 pregnant patients (100%) and 13 of 13 postmenopausal patients (100%) contained endocervical cells. Cytologic abnormalities were present in 15 of these cases; koilocytosis in 4, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)-I in 5, CIN-II in 4, and CIN-III in 2.</s><s>The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of 3 cervical smear sampling devices for obtaining acceptable yields of endocervical cells in Papanicolaou smears. The Cytopathology Laboratory, blinded to the Papanicolaou smear method, screened the smears using the Bethesda system guidelines. Statistical analyses were performed using the Pearson X2 and analysis of variance tests. There was an increased detection of endocervical cells in the Cytobrush plus Ayre spatula and the Cervex brush methods, compared with the cotton swab plus Ayre spatula group (p = 2.39 x 10(-6), p = 4.49 x 10(-7) respectively).</s><s>A retrospective study of 36,853 Papanicolaou smears recorded in our laboratory during the latter half of 1988 was undertaken to assess the effect of the absence or presence of columnar endocervical cells on the detection rate of cervical condyloma acuminatum and squamous dysplasia. However, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia was detected 2.3 times more frequently in smears with endocervical cells.</s><s>For 802 women at initial follow-up after laser treatment of cervical lesions, 421 smears prepared using the Cervex brush were compared with 381 smears prepared using the combination of a Cytobrush plus an Ayre spatula. The smears were graded for adequacy, the presence of endocervical or metaplastic cells and the presence and degree of epithelial abnormalities. Also, the number of samples classed as inadequate was significantly greater with Cervex brush smears (4.0%) than with Cytobrush-Ayre spatula smears (0.3%; P = .0003). The number of smears showing dysplasia was too small to detect realistic differences between the two sampling methods.</s><s>Four cytological sampling techniques (the Ayre's spatula alone, the Ayelesbury spatula, the Ayre's spatula in conjunction with a Cytobrush (Medscand), and the Cervex (Steriseal] were compared when used in a genitourinary medicine clinic.</s><s>The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of ectocervical sampling methods and sequence on Papanicolaou smear adequacy. The adequacy of ectocervical smears, as measured by the presence of columnar cells or squamous metaplasia, differed significantly among the four techniques studied. When the Ayre spatula was used second, 115 (69 percent) of 167 ectocervical smears were adequate compared with 75 (48 percent) of 156 smears when it was used first. One hundred ninety-six (59 percent) of 332 ectocervical smears obtained with a curved brush were adequate compared with 190 (59 percent) of 323 ectocervical smears obtained with a spatula. We recommend that an ectocervical sample be obtained only after a straight brush is used to obtain an endocervical sample.</s><s>To compare, in pregnant women, the endocervical cell yield of the Cytobrush Cell Collector and the Cervex-Brush Cell Sampler with the standard cotton swab, and to determine the incidence of serious adverse events associated with the collection techniques. The cytopathology laboratory, blinded to the Papanicolaou smear method, screened the smears using the Bethesda System guidelines. Statistical analyses were performed using the Pearson chi 2 and analysis of variance tests. There was an increased detection of endocervical cells in pregnant patients with both the Cytobrush and modified Ayers spatula (90.7%) and the Cervex-Brush (83.3%) methods, compared with the cotton swab and modified Ayers spatula (70.8%) (P = .0001 and P = .0233, respectively). There were no serious adverse events associated with the study group methods. Despite an increased incidence of spotting following collection, these techniques were not associated with an increase in serious adverse events.</s><s>Correct methods of sampling are essential for obtaining adequate smears for cytological diagnosis of cervicovaginal abnormalities. However, the combination of spatula and cotton was almost the same as spatula and cytobrush in recovering neoplastic cells.</s><s>The inefficiency of the Ayres Spatula in detecting abnormality in cervical cytology has been demonstrated recently in a number of trials. The quality of the smears, as assessed by the presence or absence of endocervical cells, revealed that the Multispatula (87.3% pick-up) produced significantly better smears (p less than 0.005) compared with the Ayres Spatula (54.4% pick-up). However, in only 129 smears taken with the Ayres Spatula were abnormal smears detected (p decreases less than 0.005).</s><s>A wooden spatula was designed to scrape the varied distribution of epithelial abnormalities of the cervix as seen at colposcopy. The efficiency of the spatula in obtaining dyskaryotic cells and improving the cellular quality of smears was compared with that of the Ayre spatula in a controlled trial. Twenty two per cent more dyskaryotic smears were obtained with the trial spatula, and the cellular quality of the smears was improved in all age groups.</s><s>In a controlled trial a new modified nylon brush (Profile brush) was compared for endocervical cell pickup with the combination of an Ayre spatula and traditional cytobrush. The two devices produced the same endocervical cell pickup rates (Ayre + cytobrush, 82.0%; Profile, 82.7%). The smears were of good quality, with no difference in the incidence of scanty or unsatisfactory smears.</s><s>We sought to determine whether use of the Cytobrush/spatula or the cotton swab/spatula is better in obtaining satisfactory Papanicolaou smears as defined by the Bethesda System. The sampling methods had similar abilities to obtain a satisfactory smear (Cytobrush/spatula 63%, cotton swab/spatula 57%; P = .23). Less-than-optimal smears accounted for 28% of the Cytobrush group and 38% of the cotton-swab group. Both sampling methods had similar rates of correlation with histologic diagnosis. There appears to be no difference in each method's ability to obtain satisfactory smears.</s>"

A total of 499 patients with acute spinal cord injury diagnosed in National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Study (NASCIS) centers within 8 hours of injury. All patients received an intravenous bolus of methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg) before randomization. Motor function change between initial presentation and at 6 weeks and 6 months after injury, and change in Functional Independence Measure (FIM) assessed at 6 weeks and 6 months. Compared with patients treated with methylprednisolone for 24 hours, those treated with methylprednisolone for 48 hours showed improved motor recovery at 6 weeks (P=.09) and 6 months (P=.07) after injury. The effect of the 48-hour methylprednisolone regimen was significant at 6 weeks (P=.04) and 6 months (P=.01) among patients whose therapy was initiated 3 to 8 hours after injury.</s><s>The introduction of microdiscectomy to lumbar spine surgery has resulted in a significant decrease in postoperative pain and length of hospital stay. This study evaluated 32 patients at a university-based Veterans Administration hospital undergoing lumbar microdiscectomy. A macerated fat graft soaked in 80 mg Depo-Medrol was placed over the affected nerve root following discectomy. Group 2 (10 patients) received 30 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine infiltrated into the paraspinal musculature at skin incision and at closure. In this group of patients, a saline-soaked fat graft was placed over the affected nerve root. Patients receiving bupivacaine and corticosteroids (Group 1) had a statistically significantly shorter hospital stay (1.4 days) compared to the control group (4.0 days) (p = 0.0004, Mann-Whitney U-test). Patients in Group 1 required less postoperative narcotic analgesia than the other groups. Postoperative complications and functional outcome were not different between the groups. These results indicate that the combination of long-acting anesthetic agents and corticosteroids can reduce postoperative discomfort and subsequently the length of postoperative hospital stay.</s><s>Studies in animals indicate that methylprednisolone and naloxone are both potentially beneficial in acute spinal-cord injury, but whether any treatment is clinically effective remains uncertain. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of methylprednisolone and naloxone in a multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with acute spinal-cord injury, 95 percent of whom were treated within 14 hours of injury. Naloxone was given to 154 patients as a bolus of 5.4 mg per kilogram, followed by infusion at 4.0 mg per kilogram per hour for 23 hours. Motor and sensory functions were assessed by systematic neurological examination on admission and six weeks and six months after injury.

To evaluate the efficacy of high-dose methylprednisolone when administered within 8 hours after whiplash injury. The management of whiplash injuries is controversial, and pharmacologic therapy has received little evaluation. They were treated for whiplash injury, which they had sustained in car accidents. Disabling symptoms severe enough to prevent the patient from returning to work, number of sick days before and after injury, and sick-leave profile after injury were used as parameters for the evaluation of the effects of the treatment. The results of this study indicate that acute treatment with high-dose methylprednisolone may be beneficial in preventing extensive sick leave after whiplash injury. However, the number of patients studied was small, and therefore further prospective, controlled studies are needed.</s><s>A prospective, randomized, and double-blind study comparing high-dose methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPSS) with placebo, in the treatment of patients with acute cervical spinal cord injury.

Forty-six patients, 42 men and 4 women (mean age, 60.6 years; range, 18-84), were included in the study: 23 in the MPSS group and 23 in the placebo group. The difference between the two groups was not statistically significant (P = 0.139). There were eight instances of pulmonary complication with MPSS (34.8%) and one instance (4.34%) with placebo (P = 0.009). Pulmonary (complications were more prevalent in patients aged more than 60 years (P = 0.029).

This study compared smoking outcomes for pregnant women (n=105) who were randomized to receive either usual care (standard cessation advice from the health care provider) or an intervention conducted in the prenatal clinic consisting of 1.5 h of counseling plus telephone follow-up delivered by a masters prepared mental health counselor. Subjects were 105 low income, predominantly Hispanic, pregnant patients in an urban prenatal clinic. Smoking outcomes were assessed at end of pregnancy and 6 months post-partum.</s><s>Primiparae were randomly assigned to two conditions of routine ultrasound examination at their first antenatal clinic visit: (a) high feedback ultrasound where the monitor screen was visible and the patient was shown the foetal size, shape and movement (N = 67); (b) low feedback ultrasound where the screen was not seen and specific verbal feedback was denied (N = 62).</s><s>We evaluated a comprehensive program of prenatal and postpartum nurse home visitation. In contrast to their comparison-group counterparts, young adolescents who were visited by nurses gave birth to newborns who were an average of 395 g heavier, and women who smoked and were visited by nurses exhibited a 75% reduction in the incidence of preterm delivery.</s><s>Brief smoking counseling during prenatal care is effective but generates modest cessation rates. Trained counselors using cognitive-behavioral and motivational interviewing methods called intervention subjects throughout pregnancy and for 2 months postpartum (mean = 5 calls, mean total contact = 68 minutes). Cotinine-validated 7-day tobacco abstinence rates in intervention and control groups were 10.0% and 7.5% at end of pregnancy (odds ratio [OR] 1.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.69-2.70; number needed to treat = 40) and 6.7% versus 7.1% at 3 months postpartum (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.44-1.99). The intervention had efficacy in light smokers and in women who had attempted cessation earlier in pregnancy. Future studies should confirm whether telephone counseling benefits these groups of pregnant smokers.</s><s>A randomized trial evaluated the impact of smoking cessation interventions on point prevalence and consecutive quit rates at an Australian public prenatal clinic. Self-reports and urine cotinine tests confirmed patients' smoking status at the midpoint and end of pregnancy and 6 weeks postpartum. At all points, validated abstinence rates were significantly higher in the experimental group than in the control group.</s><s>To evaluate the effectiveness of a physician-based intervention to promote smoking cessation during pregnancy, we conducted this randomized controlled trial in the resident-staffed prenatal clinics at the University of North Carolina Women's Hospital . Two hundred fifty prenatal patients who smoked were enrolled at their first visit and randomly assigned to the intervention or the usual-care group. Twenty percent of intervention subjects and 10% of controls reported cessation, which was verified by CO level (P = .052). In addition, this technique is inexpensive, readily accepted by staff, and efficient.</s><s>The aim of the study was to test the psychosocial benefits of a telephone support program for pregnant women. There were 66 women in the control group and 65 women in the intervention group. The intervention and control groups did not differ significantly on the psychosocial measures at baseline. The intervention group at 34 weeks had lower stress scores than the control group (means 16.5 vs 18.4, p = 0.02), lower trait anxiety (means 35.2 vs 39.4, p = 0.04) and less depressed mood (means 6.6 vs 8.1, p = 0.02). Self esteem was higher for the intervention group (means 34.9 vs 32.5, p = 0.008).</s><s>To determine whether motivational interviewing--a behavioural therapy for addictions-provided at home by specially trained midwives helps pregnant smokers to quit. 762/1684 pregnant women who were regular smokers at antenatal booking: 351 in intervention group and 411 in control group. Self reported smoking cessation verified by plasma or salivary cotinine concentration. Fifteen (4.2%) women in the intervention group cut down (self report and cotinine concentration less than half that at booking) compared with 26 (6.3%) in the control group.</s><s>Our purpose was to assess whether an intervention in the education of the mother and the support person involves a change in health-related behavior and use of health facilities. A randomized, controlled trial was conducted in four cities of Latin America on pregnant women at risk. Half of them (n = 1115) received a home intervention of four to six visits dealing with psychosocial support and education about health-related habits, alarm signs, hospital facilities, antismoking and antialcohol programs, and a reinforcement of adequate health services utilization for the pregnant woman and a support person. No differences between groups were observed in improvement on diet, cigarette and alcohol consumption, maternal physical strain, lactation at 40 days postpartum, and utilization of health facilities.</s><s>Physicians' advice to help pregnant women quit smoking during prenatal care has had mixed results. Pregnant women who smoked were randomly assigned to receive structured advice from their physician and referral to individual behavior change counseling during prenatal care or to receive brief advice to stop smoking and a quit smoking booklet at their first visit. Compared with usual care, greater proportions of intervention group women reported not smoking at the 36th-week visit (14% vs 10%) and at 1 year postpartum (18% vs 11%), but these differences were not significant.</s><s>This study examined smoking cessation and cigarette reduction of indigent inner city pregnant women (n = 193) who completed one of three interventions: a special video program based on their perceptions of the effects of smoking during pregnancy, the American Lung Association's \"Freedom From Smoking For You and Your Baby\" program, or the usual physician's advice.</s><s>To examine the barriers encountered by pregnant women who attempt to stop smoking by highlighting three women who used nicotine patches. Ethics approval was granted despite NRT being contraindicated in Australia for pregnant women and having a low safety rating (category D) (Australian Drug Evaluation Committee, 1999). Salivary cotinine levels were used to assess nicotine exposure and provide some indicator of NRT safety. All participants were given pregnancy-specific cessation counselling, and the 20 women in the treatment arm were offered nicotine patches (15 mg/16 hr), with the option of weaning to lower strength patches if desired. As has been found in the general population, 'quit' rates with NRT use were low. Only three of the participants in this study, who became abstinent with patch use during pregnancy, were still abstinent at birth. The circumstances of two of these women, and a third woman who used patches to 'control' her smoking despite researcher advice, are detailed here. Although health providers intuitively regard pregnancy as an appropriate time for women to stop smoking, the stressors during pregnancy seem to militate against cessation.</s><s>Smoking relapse prevention methods for pregnant women: a formative evaluation.</s><s>To assess the differential effectiveness of two methods of disseminating a smoking cessation programme to public hospital antenatal clinics. Clinics were allocated to a simple dissemination (SD) condition (11 clinics) which received a mail-out of programme resources or to an intensive dissemination (ID) condition (11 clinics) which included the mail-out plus feedback, training, and ongoing support with midwife facilitator. Outcomes were: (1) levels of smoking status assessment by clinic staff; (2) proportion of women identifying as having been smokers at their first visit who reported receiving cessation advice; (3) proportion of these women who had quit (self report and expired air carbon monoxide (CO)); and (4) smoking prevalence among all women (self report and CO). There were no significant differences between the groups on change on any outcome. Relatively modest strategies for encouraging incorporation of smoking cessation activities into antenatal care were not effective in the long term.</s><s>Our objective was to examine the efficacy of the added effect of individualized smoking relapse prevention counseling on obstetricians' and nurse midwives' usual advice during prenatal care. One hundred and seventy-five pregnant women who were smoking early in their pregnancy, but had quit by first prenatal visit, were randomly assigned to receive the usual advice from their obstetrician or nurse midwife, or usual advice plus individual relapse prevention counseling. No significant difference in relapse rates during pregnancy was observed based on urinary cotinine/creatinine ratios, but these rates, 29.5% and 27.9% respectively, were substantially higher than those based on self-report. The average number of days abstinent reported by women in the intervention group was significantly longer than that in the usual care group, 199 days versus 166 days respectively (P < .01). Long-term relapse rates were not significantly different: intervention group, 50.9%, usual care group, 50.0%.</s><s>Pregnant smokers attending a local health department WIC clinic were randomly assigned to one of two self-help smoking cessation programs or usual care.</s><s>This study is an evaluation of relapse prevention interventions for smokers who quit during pregnancy. Pregnant smokers at 2 managed care organizations were randomized to receive a self-help booklet only, prepartum relapse prevention, or prepartum and postpartum relapse prevention. Follow-up surveys were conducted at 28 weeks of pregnancy and at 8 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months postpartum. A nonsignificant reduction in relapse among the pre/post group contributed to differences in prevalent abstinence. Relapse prevention interventions may need to be increased in duration and potency to prevent post-partum relapse.</s><s>This article describes preliminary findings of an experimental, randomized, three-group, controlled design examining the effectiveness of a smoking cessation intervention for pregnant teens. The TFSB group consistently achieved greater smoking cessation across all measures when compared to the subjects in the other two groups.</s><s>This exploratory study examined the acceptability and efficacy of a videotape modeling smoking cessation as an adjunct to smoking cessation advice delivered during prenatal care. Outcomes included opinions about content and acceptability of the videotape, and smoking behavior change during pregnancy. The most highly endorsed features of the videotape were seeing other women quitting smoking (77%), dealing with stress and bad feelings (69%), talking about what to do with urges to smoke (69%), and discussing ways to get support from families and friends (54%).</s><s>To investigate the feasibility and impact of integrating a cotinine-assisted smoking intervention programme with an existing antenatal maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) screening service for open neural tube defects. The women were individually allocated at random to intervention or control groups within each centre at the time the serum sample was received for AFP measurement. The intervention group received an interpreted measurement of the serum cotinine, reported through the physician to the woman, along with a self-help smoking cessation booklet and a repeat serum cotinine measurement one month later, again interpreted and reported through the physician to the woman. The smoking intervention programme led to a significant 66 g increase in mean birthweight (P = 0.03; 95% CI+9 to +123 g) and to a 30% reduction in the rate of low birthweight in pregnancies managed by the 70 physicians who secured the highest rate of obtaining repeat serum samples for cotinine measurements in their intervention group. A cotinine-assisted smoking intervention programme managed from a central location as an adjunct to a maternal serum AFP screening service can, with the cooperation of physicians responsible for antenatal care, lead to a significant and cost-effective reduction in the number of low birthweight babies. This programme is inexpensive, requires little extra effort, and does not need specially trained personnel.</s><s>To test the hypothesis that appropriate interventions delivered by midwives within usual primary maternity care, can assist women to stop or reduce the amount they smoke and facilitate longer duration of breast feeding. Women receiving only the smoking cessation or reduction programme were significantly more likely to have reduced, stopped smoking or maintained smoking changes than women in the control group, at 28 weeks and 36 weeks gestation. Women receiving both the smoking cessation and breast-feeding education and support programmes were significantly more likely than women in the control group to have changed their smoking behaviour at 36 weeks gestation. There was no difference in rates of full breast feeding between the control and intervention groups for women who planned to breast feed. Education and support by midwives, as part of primary midwifery, can facilitate smoking cessation and reduction during pregnancy.</s><s>To assess the effect of nicotine patches on continine-validated smoking cessation in pregnant women and the effect of nicotine on birth weight and preterm delivery. Women randomized to nicotine were treated with 15-mg patches (16 hours/day) for 8 weeks, and 10-mg patches (16 hours/day) for 3 weeks. At the end of the intervention, the mean value of cotinine in saliva in women assigned to nicotine was 120 ng/mL and placebo 153 ng/mL (mean difference -33; 95% CI -72, 6 ng/mL). Mean birth weight difference was 186 g (95% CI 35, 336 g) higher in the nicotine than placebo group, and there was an insignificantly lower rate of low birth weight (under 2500 g) in the former group.</s><s>From theories that suggest behavior is influenced by direct observation of personal and immediate consequences of the behavior, we hypothesized that public prenatal patients would reduce their smoking if they observed the level of carbon monoxide in their own alveolar air.</s><s>Clients were 100 consecutive self-reported smokers booking at clinics in Glasgow from March to May 1997. In addition, intervention clients received a median of four home-based motivational interviewing sessions from one specially trained midwife. All sessions (n = 171) were audio-taped and interviews (n = 49) from 13 randomly selected clients were transcribed for content analysis. Cotinine measurement on routine blood samples confirmed self-reported smoking change from late pregnancy telephone interview. Fisher exact, chi 2 and Mann-Whitney tests compared enrolment characteristics.</s><s>To evaluate the effect of a provider counseling and office systems intervention in obstetric, pediatric, and Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) clinics on smoking and relapse rates in pregnant and postpartum women. Five community health centers were randomized to special intervention (SI) or usual care (UC). Prenatal and postpartum interviews assessed smoking status and related factors. This effect remained at 1 month postpartum but was lost at 3- and 6-month postpartum follow-ups.</s><s>The effectiveness of low-cost smoking interventions targeted to pregnant women has been demonstrated, although few gains in absolute cessation rates have been reported in the past decade. 390 English-speaking women 18 years of age or older who self-reported to be active smokers at their initial prenatal appointment. No attempt was made to change smoking-related usual care advice from prenatal providers. Twenty percent of participants were confirmed as abstinent with no significant differences found between intervention groups. No differential intervention effects were found within strata of these predictors or by baseline stage of readiness to change. Neither a computerized telephone cessation program nor systematic provision of motivational counseling improved cessation rates over a tailored self-help booklet delivered within the context of brief advice from prenatal providers. Innovative strategies need to be developed to increase the effectiveness of existing prenatal smoking interventions.</s><s>An evaluation of videotaped vignettes for smoking cessation and relapse prevention during pregnancy: the very important pregnant smokers (VIPS) program.</s><s>This study hypothesized that midwives with fuller training in smoking cessation and intervention techniques would be more successful Than those without such training at enabling pregnant women to give up smoking. Twenty-six midwives were divided equally between a control and treatment group. The treatment group reported reducing smoking by 13.1 cigarettes a day compared with 16 in the control group.</s><s>Studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions targeted at women who are smoking during pregnancy. In contrast, there is limited information about the experience of smokers who have stopped before entering prenatal care--\"spontaneous quitters.\" The intervention consisted predominantly of printed materials received through the mail. Biochemical confirmation of continuous abstinence through delivery revealed that 16% of the women in the experimental self-help program relapsed compared with 20% of usual care controls (NS).</s><s>In a randomised controlled trial intensive individual anti-smoking advice given in parallel with hospital antenatal care did not influence the outcome of pregnancy. Other possible interpretations of the results, that maternal smoking is merely an index of some other factor that retards growth or that those counselled did not reduce their smoking sufficiently to influence outcome, cannot be excluded.</s><s>We examined the efficacy of individualized smoking cessation counseling added to obstetricians' and nurse-midwives' advice. In a mixed private and publicly supported prenatal clinic 600 pregnant women who smoked were randomly assigned to receive the usual advice from their obstetrician or nurse-midwife or the usual advice plus individualized smoking cessation counseling. Smoking status was measured by self-report and urinary cotinine/creatinine ratios at 36 weeks and by self-report during long-term postpartum follow-up. Quitting rates during pregnancy were not increased by adding individualized smoking cessation counseling to usual care.</s><s>The aim of randomized trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of anti-smoking counseling in the population of pregnant women from the maternity centers in Lódź, central Poland. One hundred and forty nine current smokers and 56 spontaneous quitters were randomized into the smoking cessation intervention and 144 current smokers and 37 spontaneous quitters were included in the control group. The intervention program covered four midwife visits during pregnancy and one after delivery. The difference in the mean infant birthweight between the quitters and non-quitters was 203.8 g (p = 0.01) in the intervention group and 198.2 g in the control group (p = 0.08).</s><s>Randomised controlled trial using social support and financial incentives for high risk pregnant smokers: significant other supporter (SOS) program.</s><s>To evaluate the effectiveness in helping pregnant women stop smoking of two interventions (Pro-Change for a healthy pregnancy) based on the transtheoretical model of behaviour change (TTM) compared to current standard care. 918 pregnant smokers\n                100 general practices were randomised into the three trial arms. Combining the two arms, the odds ratios at 30 weeks were 2.09 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 4.85) for 10 week sustained abstinence and 2.92 (95% CI 1.42 to 6.03) for point prevalence abstinence relative to controls. While there is a small borderline significant increase in quitting in the combined intervention arms compared with the controls, the effect of the intervention is small. Given also that the intervention was resource intensive, it is of doubtful benefit.</s><s>To evaluate whether ultrasound screening during pregnancy decreases the frequency of smoking in women who present with a history of smoking. Women in the screened group were routinely scheduled for ultrasound screening at 16 to 22 weeks' gestation and at 31 to 35 weeks' gestation. For those who continued smoking, the mean number of cigarettes smoked per day, as reported at the time of delivery, was slightly higher in the screened group. Ultrasound screening does not reduce the frequency of smoking during pregnancy.</s><s>Quit for keeps: tailored smoking cessation guides for pregnancy and beyond.</s><s>This study was a randomized controlled trial of a smoking cessation intervention for pregnant smokers. Women who reported smoking at their first antenatal visit and satisfied the inclusion criteria were asked to participate in the trial. There was no significant difference in quit rate between women receiving the intervention and women in the control group (11.9% versus 9.8% p=0.41). Babies born to women receiving the intervention were on average 84 g heavier than babies born to controls (p=0.04). The factors that contribute to the lack of a significant increase in smoking cessation in the intervention group and the possible explanation for the changes in birth-weight are discussed.</s><s>Three hundred and forty-six women who reported smoking one or more cigarettes per day prior to the 20th week of gestation were recruited into a trial of health educational counselling to stop or reduce cigarette smoking. Among the 319 women included in analysis, at first follow-up visit those who received counselling smoked 1.7 fewer cigarettes a day than control women (P less than 0.05) and 10.4% had stopped smoking, compared to 5.4% in the control group (NS). Study effects were limited to the 284 women smoking five or more cigarettes a day at booking. While there was no effect of counselling on either serum thiocyanate or end expiratory carbon monoxide, the counselled group gained slightly more weight than controls during the study (0.47 vs. 0.44 kg per week among controls; NS), and their infants had modestly higher birthweight (44 g; NS).</s><s>These clinical trial results are the first, to our knowledge, from a prospective, randomized, and controlled experiment demonstrating that a reduction of smoking during pregnancy improves the birth weight of the infant. Nine hundred thirty-five pregnant smokers were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups; the former received smoking intervention. The findings suggest that some fetal growth retardation can be overcome by the provision of antismoking assistance to pregnant women.</s><s>The purpose of this prospective, randomized controlled study was to determine the efficacy of an intensified, late pregnancy, smoking cessation intervention for resistant pregnant smokers (n = 269). At 6 weeks postpartum, 27.1% of the E2 group reported being abstinent or light smokers vs. 14.6% of the controls. Results lend preliminary but very modest support for this intervention with resistant pregnant smokers.</s><s>In 1986, the state health departments of Colorado, Maryland, and Missouri conducted a federally-funded demonstration project to increase smoking cessation among pregnant women receiving prenatal care and services from the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program in public clinics. Low-intensity interventions were designed to be integrated into routine prenatal care. Urine cotinine concentrations were determined at CDC by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and were used to verify self-reported smoking status.</s><s>We tested the effectiveness of a health counseling method by midwives using a RCT. Midwives in the experimental group provided brief health counseling, self-help materials on smoking cessation during pregnancy and early postpartum, and a partner booklet. Multi-level analysis revealed significant differences between both conditions at T1 and T2 using intention-to-treat analysis. Nineteen percent of the experimental group reported 7-day abstinence compared to 7% of the control group at T1, and 21 and 12%, respectively, at T2. The intervention resulted in significant effects on smoking behavior for pregnant women, but not for partner smoking.</s><s>This study examines whether adding nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for pregnant smokers increases rates of smoking cessation. Data were collected from 2003 through 2005; analyses were conducted in 2006 and 2007. Women in the CBT+NRT arm were almost three times more likely than women in the CBT-only arm to have biochemically validated cessation at both pregnancy time points (after 7 weeks: 24% vs 8%, p=0.02; at 38 weeks gestation: 18% vs 7%, p=0.04), but not at 3 months postpartum (20% vs 14%, p=0.55). Recruitment was suspended early by an Independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board when an interim analysis found a higher rate of negative birth outcomes in the CBT+NRT arm than in the CBT-only arm. More data are needed to determine safety parameters and to confirm the efficacy of NRT use during pregnancy.</s><s>To evaluate the efficacy of a brief smoking cessation intervention with pregnant women practicable routinely by midwives. Booking interviews with pregnant women in nine hospital and community trusts. A total of 1120 pregnant women in the third month of pregnancy (249 recent ex-smokers and 871 current smokers). Only a small proportion of the women who would have been eligible to take part in the trial were actually recruited by 178 recruiting midwives, with lack of time being cited as the main barrier. The intervention and usual care groups differed in post-delivery point prevalence abstinence rates for recent ex-smokers (65% vs. 53%, p < 0.05, one-tailed), but not in other outcome measures. Overall, 54% of \"recent ex-smokers\" at booking and 7% of \"current smokers\" at booking had been abstinent for at least 3 months at the time of delivery, and 23% and 3%, respectively, were still abstinent by the time the child was 6 months old (i.e. Other options such as tailored self-help materials and telephone counselling and other specialist treatments should be examined.</s><s>A multicomponent motivational smoking cessation intervention was evaluated in 33 prenatal, family planning, and pediatric services in 12 public health clinics. Clinic-based intervention components were implemented by clinic personnel as part of routine medical visits. Subjects were 683 (baseline) and 1,064 (experimental) smokers with measurements of smoking outcomes at both times. Compared to controls, smokers exposed to the intervention were more likely to have quit (14.5 versus 7.7%) or take actions toward quitting and had higher mean action, stage of readiness, and motivation to quit scores. These positive effects persisted when clustering within clinics and services was controlled. This intervention, implemented by clinic personnel as part of routine medical visits, was effective under these natural conditions across different types of clinic service.</s><s>Smoking is the most important modifiable risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcome in the UK. All intervention patients were interviewed at their initial visit and tested for smoking. Self-reported cigarette consumption fell significantly (P < 0.001) in the intervention group, with 16.2% giving up and 33.3% significantly reducing their cigarette consumption. Point-of-care testing and feedback coupled with counselling can significantly reduce smoking during pregnancy and increase birthweight.</s><s>The aim was to study the effect of a multimodal smoking cessation intervention regimen on a number of pregnant smokers. A prospective intervention study was designed where participants were allocated to intervention or control based on their birth date. The intervention group (n = 327) received initial individual smoking cessation counseling supplemented by an invitation to join, individually or in a group, a smoking cessation program with nicotine replacement therapy as a voluntary option. Intervention was designed as an integral part of the midwives' prenatal care. Self-reported cessation rates during pregnancy were significantly higher in the intervention group (14%) than in the group receiving usual care (5.0%) (p < 0.0001) (Fisher's exact test). Cotinine-validated cessation rates during pregnancy were significantly higher among the former (7%) than the latter (2%) (p = 0.003).</s><s>Smoking during pregnancy has been linked to health problems, including the risk of low birthweight, preterm labour, spontaneous abortion and perinatal death. Two trials to investigate the efficacy of self-help materials were undertaken. Smoking cessation rates were lower than expected, and process measures indicated that materials were not being used. A second trial was commenced after a comprehensive review of the materials with focus groups of pregnant women and one-to-one interviews of nurses and doctors. Trial 2 was based new materials, and used a magazine-style (smoking cessation) booklet designed by the focus groups. A total of 119 women were randomly allocated into the new-materials group or a usual-care group.</s><s>This study examined the effects of a smoking cessation intervention on stages of change in 349 low-income, pregnant women. Kruskal-Wallis tests revealed significant differences at the second visit in the stage distributions by condition for subjects who were initially in precontemplation or in preparation. In each case, a greater proportion of experimental than usual care subjects advanced through the stages.</s><s>Proactive telephone peer support to help pregnant women stop smoking.</s><s>This study examined whether voucher-based reinforcement therapy (VBRT) contingent upon smoking abstinence during pregnancy is an effective method for decreasing maternal smoking during pregnancy and improving fetal growth. A two-condition, parallel-groups, randomized controlled trial was conducted in a university-based research clinic. Participants were assigned randomly to either contingent or non-contingent voucher conditions. Smoking outcomes were evaluated using urine-toxicology testing and self-report. Fetal growth outcomes were evaluated using serial ultrasound examinations performed during the third trimester.</s><s>A smoking cessation and relapse prevention intervention was tested in an urban, prenatal clinic serving predominantly low-income, African-American women. At their first prenatal visit, 391 smokers were randomly assigned to an experimental (E) group to receive usual clinic information plus a prenatal and postpartum intervention or to a control (C) group to receive only usual clinic information. The intervention consisted of individual skills instruction and counseling by a peer health counselor on the use of a self-help cessation guide and routine clinic reinforcement.</s><s>A randomised controlled trial of individual counselling of smokers in pregnancy.</s><s>Little insight is available in the literature on how best to assist the pregnant smoker in public health maternity clinics to quit during pregnancy. A randomized pretest/posttest experiment was used to evaluate the effectiveness of two different self-help cessation methods. Of the women assigned to the ALA method, 6 per cent quit and 14 per cent reduced their SCN levels substantially. Results of this trial indicate that health education methods tailored to the pregnant smoker are more effective in changing smoking behavior than the standard clinic information and advice to quit and/or the use of smoking cessation methods not tailored to the needs of the pregnant smoker.</s><s>We report the results of a population-based randomized clinical trial that tested the effectiveness of a prenatal self-help smoking cessation program. The population (n = 242) consisted of a socioeconomically and ethnically diverse group of pregnant women enrolled in a large health maintenance organization (HMO) who reported they were smoking at the time of their first prenatal visit.</s><s>One hundred forty-two pregnant, predominantly Hispanic women were assigned to a peer-led smoking cessation program or to usual care. Birth weight for infants born to women who quit smoking averaged 7.2 lb versus 6.8 and 6.3 lb for mothers smoking one to six and more than six cigarettes per day at delivery (P <.01). Infant birth weight increases with both smoking cessation and smoking reduction, suggesting that peer counseling intervention programs may improve newborn health despite their failure to affect smoking cessation.</s><s>The effects of anti-smoking health education during pregnancy on smoking behaviour and the subsequent infant's size at birth were investigated in a controlled trial. It was found that the planned educational intervention was incompletely carried out and was given more effectively to primigravidae in whom subsequent reduction of smoking was more evident.</s><s>A randomized trial (the Birmingham Trial II) was conducted to evaluate the behavioral impact of health education methods among 814 female smokers at four public health maternity clinics. Black E and C Group patients had higher quit rates than White E and C Group patients. Health education methods are efficacious and cost beneficial for pregnant smokers in public health maternity clinics.</s><s>We report results from a pilot study examining the use of vouchers redeemable for retail items as incentives for smoking cessation during pregnancy and postpartum. Of 100 study-eligible women who were still smoking upon entering prenatal care, 58 were recruited from university-based and community obstetric practices to participate in a smoking cessation study. Participants were assigned to either contingent or noncontingent voucher conditions. In the contingent condition, vouchers were earned for biochemically verified smoking abstinence. In the noncontingent condition, vouchers were earned independent of smoking status. That effect was sustained through the 24-week postpartum assessment (27% vs. 0%), which was 12 weeks after discontinuation of the voucher program.</s><s>To evaluate the effectiveness of a self help approach to smoking cessation in pregnancy. Pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial with community midwife as the unit of randomisation. Other outcomes were self reported smoking status and cigarette consumption among daily smokers. In the intervention group, 156 (25.6%) women reported not smoking for at least seven days, compared with 207 (29.1%) in the normal care group. Pregnant women and midwives approved of the intervention, but the way in which it was delivered varied considerably. The self help intervention was acceptable but ineffective when implemented during routine antenatal care. More intensive and complex interventions, appropriately targeted and tailored, need to be developed and evaluated. Validated smoking cessation rates among pregnant women are substantially lower than the self reported rates on which current smoking policy is based.</s><s>Three groups (n = 50 each) of pregnant smokers wanting to quit the habit were assigned to three different intervention programs around their 18th week in pregnancy. Twelve months later, 16%, 6% and 8% respectively, remained abstinent in the three groups. We conclude that smoking in pregnancy, being one of the few amenable to risk factors affecting the perinatal death statistics, demands an active smoking cessation program during pregnancy led by specially trained health professionals.</s><s>At Buskerud Central Hospital in Norway, a county hospital with 2000 deliveries per year, an intervention study, using hypnosis, aimed at smoking cessation and reduction among pregnant women still smoking around 18th week of pregnancy was carried out during the period 1992-1993. No significant effect on smoking cessation or smoking reduction was obtained (p > 0.05). We recorded a 10% quit rate in both intervention group and control group, and 42% and 31% reduced their smoking in the intervention group and control group, respectively.</s><s>To investigate the effects of a low cost multicomponent intervention program among pregnant heavy smokers. Around the 18th week of gestation the women received information about the dangers of smoking in pregnancy together with a self-help manual. Smoking cessation, reduction, increase and no change in smoking consumption was registered. 20% stopped smoking and 65% reduced their smoking in the intervention group compared to 4% and 38% respectively in the control group. This low cost multiple intervention model seems more effective than other intervention models investigated in Norway.</s><s>The purposes of this study were (1) to determine the extent to which tobacco exposure assessment and new patient education methods, derived from a meta-analysis and the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research guideline recommendations, could be provided routinely by trained Medicaid maternity care staff members and (2) to document the behavioral impact of these interventions among pregnant smokers. Self-report and saliva cotinine assessments of tobacco exposure were performed at baseline and at the end of pregnancy. A significantly higher percentage of patients quit smoking in the experimental group (17.3%) than in the control group (8.8%).</s>"

Pre-eclampsia was defined as systolic/diastolic blood pressure over 140/90 plus proteinuria. A sevenfold reduction in the occurrence of pre-eclamsia were seen among the calcium group compared with the placebo group (7 out of 15 developed pre-eclampsia in control group vs. 1 out of 15 in calcium group, P=0.014). A longer duration of pregnancy was seen in calcium than placebo (mean+/-S.D.=37+/-2 for calcium and 34+/-2 for placebo, P<0.05).</s><s>A multicentre, randomized controlled double-blind trial in 5 maternity hospitals in Australia assessed the effect of a daily supplement of calcium (1.8g oral calcium or an oral placebo) taken daily until delivery, from less than 24 weeks' gestation, on the frequency of pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia and preterm birth (< 37 weeks' gestation) in 456 nulliparas with a singleton pregnancy. Treatment with calcium reduced the risk of preeclampsia (relative risk 0.44 [95% CI, 0.21-0.90], p = 0.02) and the risk of preterm birth (relative risk 0.44 [95% CI, 0.21-0.90], p = 0.02). An updated systematic review of the 9 randomized trials of calcium supplementation in pregnancy shows a significant reduction in the risk of hypertension and preeclampsia although no effect on preterm birth. Calcium supplementation during pregnancy reduced the risk of preeclampsia and preterm birth in this nulliparous population.</s><s>Previous studies have suggested that increased dietary calcium is associated with a decreased occurrence of pregnancy-induced hypertension. From 24 weeks gestation until delivery they received either 2 g of elemental calcium per day or a placebo. Treatment was associated with a decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure over the course of pregnancy.</s><s>Calcium supplementation has been reported to reduce blood pressure in pregnant and nonpregnant women. The women were randomly assigned to receive 2 g per day of elemental calcium in the form of calcium carbonate (593 women) or placebo (601 women). The women were followed to the end of their pregnancies, and the incidence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy was determined. The rates of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy were lower in the calcium group than in the placebo group (9.8 percent vs. 14.8 percent; odds ratio, 0.63; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.44 to 0.90). Among the women who had low ratios of urinary calcium to urinary creatinine (less than or equal to 0.62 mmol per millimole) during the 20th week of gestation, those in the calcium group had a lower risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (odds ratio, 0.56; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.29 to 1.09) and less of an increase in diastolic and systolic blood pressure than the placebo group.</s><s>Fifty-two healthy pregnant women were enrolled in a double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial. Subjects in the calcium group, after adjustment for race and initial blood pressure (BP), had a term mean systolic and diastolic BP value of 4-5 mmHg lower than those in the placebo group (P less than .05). Combining these values with previous data, we found a dose-effect relationship between calcium intake and BP reduction during the third trimester of pregnancy.</s><s>In a randomized controlled trial 201 healthy nulliparous women were randomly allocated by means of a computer generated randomization list. The study groups were very similar at the time of randomization; with respect to several clinical and demographic variables. The rate of pregnancy induced hypertension was lower in the calcium group than in the placebo group 8.24%; vs 29.03%; (RR = 0.28; 95% CI 0.14-0.59).</s><s>Results are presented of a randomized, double-blinded controlled clinical trial of calcium supplementation (2.0 gm of elemental calcium as calcium carbonate) and a placebo. Treatment consisted of 2.8 (+/- 1.5) tablets per day in the placebo group (N = 95) and 3.0 (+/- 1.4) tablets per day in the calcium group (N = 94). The calcium group had a lower incidence of preterm delivery (less than 37 weeks; 7.4% vs 21.1%; p = 0.007); spontaneous labor and preterm delivery (6.4% vs 17.9%; p = 0.01); and low birth weight (9.6% vs 21.1%; p = 0.03). This effect was also present after stratified analysis by level of treatment compliance, urinary tract infection, and chlamydial infection.</s><s>Previous trials have suggested that calcium supplementation during pregnancy may reduce the risk of preeclampsia. However, differences in study design and a low dietary calcium intake in the populations studied limit acceptance of the data. Surveillance for preeclampsia was conducted by personnel unaware of treatment-group assignments, using standardized measurements of blood pressure and urinary protein excretion at uniformly scheduled prenatal visits, protocols for monitoring these measurements during the hospitalization for delivery, and reviews of medical records of unscheduled outpatient visits and all hospitalizations. Calcium supplementation did not significantly reduce the incidence or severity of preeclampsia or delay its onset. Calcium supplementation during pregnancy did not prevent preeclampsia, pregnancy-associated hypertension, or adverse perinatal outcomes in healthy nulliparous women.</s><s>The purpose of this trial was to determine whether calcium supplementation of pregnant women with low calcium intake reduces preeclampsia and preterm delivery. Women who were recruited before gestational week 20 received supplements (1.5 g calcium/d or placebo) throughout pregnancy. Primary outcomes were preeclampsia and preterm delivery; secondary outcomes focused on severe morbidity and maternal and neonatal mortality rates. Both groups had similar gestational ages, demographic characteristics, and blood pressure levels at entry. Calcium supplementation was associated with a non-statistically significant small reduction in preeclampsia (4.1% vs 4.5%) that was evident by 35 weeks of gestation (1.2% vs 2.8%; P = .04). Preterm delivery (the neonatal primary outcome) and early preterm delivery tended to be reduced among women who were < or = 20 years of age (risk ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.67-1.01; risk ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.42-0.98, respectively). A 1.5-g calcium/day supplement did not prevent preeclampsia but did reduce its severity, maternal morbidity, and neonatal mortality, albeit these were secondary outcomes.</s><s>To determine whether increased calcium intake (2 g/day) in pregnancy is effective in reducing the risk of preeclampsia in pregnant teenagers. The present study was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial. Blood pressure (BP) was measured twice every 4 weeks until delivery and at 48 hours after delivery. Calcium supplementation was associated with a significantly decreased risk of preeclampsia (risk reduction 12.35%; P < .001), with 3.2% (n = 4) developing preeclampsia in the treatment group versus 15.5% (n = 21) in the placebo group. Moreover, calcium supplementation led to a reduction in systolic BP of 9.1 mmHg and in diastolic BP of 6.0 mmHg.</s>"

One hundred nineteen full-term male, normal birth weight neonates, 12 hours old or older. No treatment (our standard care), DPNB, or oral sucrose prior to circumcision. Differences between groups in loss of data due to episodes of excessive motion. Overall, the average difference in the elevation of heart rates during the circumcision operative procedure among the 3 groups and the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were as follows: control vs DPNB, 27.1 beats/min (17.6, 36.6) and control vs sucrose, 9.7 beats/min (0.1, 19.3). However, the analysis did not include missing data due to excessive motion, which occurred predominantly in the no-treatment control group.</s><s>The aim of the present study was to test analgesic effects of double- versus single-dose breast milk and compare this effect with efficacy of double- versus single-dose sucrose in a group of healthy term newborns during heel prick blood sampling. Crying times were 117 s, 126 s, 82 s, 128 s, 117 s, and 95 s in groups 1-6, respectively (P= 0.053). The mean pain scores were 4.60, 5.82, 3.91, 4.94, 5, and 4.05 in groups 1-6, respectively (P= 0.068). There was a significant difference between the single-dose sucrose group and single-dose sterile water group at 1 min (P= 0.002). The babies in the sucrose group were active awake, whereas the ones in the breast milk group were asleep before heel prick. Two milliliters breast milk does not reduce response to pain during minor painful procedures in term neonates even when two doses have been given.</s><s>The aim of this study was to investigate whether repeated doses of hindmilk were effective for pain relief during routine heel stick in term neonates. Infants enrolled in this double-blind placebo-controlled study were randomly assigned to hindmilk, 12.5% sucrose and distilled water groups. Infants were given 1 ml of the test solution 1 minute prior to, immediately before and 1 minute after the heel stick. Pain responses were assessed by physiologic and behavioral parameters and also according to the Neonatal Facial Coding System (NFCS). When the hindmilk group was compared to the sucrose group, only the NFCS scores at 1 and 2 minutes reached statistical significance in favor of the sucrose group.</s><s>It remains unclear whether \"sucrose analgesia\" is related to a pre- or postabsorptive mechanism.</s><s>The potential of sucrose to reduce the pain response in a group of healthy premature infants was investigated. Fifteen infants of 32-34 weeks postmenstrual age were tested in a blind crossover manner on two separate occasions no more than two days apart. It is concluded that sucrose has analgesic effects in healthy premature infants.</s><s>A substance commercially described as 'sugar free,' used as a sweetener for paracetamol suspension, was evaluated on measures of neonatal pain. Sixty infants were randomly allocated to receive one of four solutions before heel stab blood sampling: sterile water (placebo); 25 or 50% sucrose (weight/volume); and the commercial sweet-tasting solution. It is concluded that this sweet-tasting solution has analgesic effects as potent as those of concentrated sucrose solutions.</s><s>We assessed the effect of sucrose as a pain reliever in a population of newborns when cuddled and comforted during heel prick for diagnosis of phenylketonuria. In addition, the influences of gender, gestational age, postnatal age, ponderal index and behavioural state of the infant before the heel prick were studied, as judged by the neonatal infant pain scale (NIPS) score, on crying time (CT) and subsequent NIPS score. 100 healthy full-term infants were enrolled in this double-blind, randomized controlled trial. The sessions were videotaped and analyzed for determination of CT and NIPS scores. No influence of gender, gestational age, postnatal age or ponderal index on CT was found. Intra-orally administered sucrose given before heel prick can be recommended as a useful pain reliever.</s><s>It has been suggested that sucrose acts as an analgesic in the neonatal period. To evaluate this further, 52 infants received either 2 ml of 7.5% sucrose or 2 ml of sterile water before heel stab blood sampling.</s><s>To determine whether lingual sucrose modifies the pain response to nasogastric tube insertion in preterm infants. 20 stable preterm infants who required nasogastric tube insertion for feeding, randomised on 51 occasions. Infants who received sucrose demonstrated a significantly lower Neonatal Facial Coding Score during nasogastric tube passage compared with the placebo group (median 1 (range 0-4) vs 3 (0-4), p = 0.004). Pain response measurements quickly returned to baseline after nasogastric tube insertion. Adverse effects, such as apnoea or oxygen desaturation, were few and occurred equally in each group. Single-dose lingual 24% sucrose is effective in reducing the behavioural and physiological pain response to nasogastric tube insertion in preterm infants and it appears to be safe.</s><s>Previous randomized trials of the analgesic effects of sucrose, glucose, and a pacifier in term neonates have shown that the pacifier resulted in lower pain scores than glucose or sucrose, but the pacifier with and without sucrose did not differ. Pain scores were measured with the Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP), a validated behavioral acute pain scale. Of all the regimens, the lowest pain scores occurred with the use of 24% sucrose solution combined with pacifier. The synergistic effect of the combination of sucrose and non-nutritive sucking was clinically effective and safe in relieving the pain of simple procedures such as venipuncture or heel stick in preterm and term infants, but further research is needed on these interventions alone and in combination with other behavioral interventions in neonates.</s><s>A randomized study was done to compare non pharmacological methods to reduce the pain of heel pricks in 104 stable term neonates. Duration of cry and Douleur Aiguë du Nouveau né (DAN) score were used to assess pain. At 30 seconds after the stimulus, the pain scores were lowest in the sucrose group but this was not sustained at 1, 2 and 4 minutes. In conclusion, our study suggests that rocking or giving a baby a pacifier are more effective non-pharmacological analgesics than EBM, DW, sucrose or massage for the pain of heel pricks in neonates. A calm or sleeping state before a painful procedure also appears to decrease crying and pain scores.</s><s>In term infants sucrose given by mouth has been reported to reduce duration of crying after a heel prick. This study was designed primarily to investigate the effect of sucrose administered orally immediately before heel lancing on the nociceptive reaction in preterm infants as assessed by change in heart rate and duration of crying. A secondary objective was to document changes in cerebral blood volume during acute pain. The patients studied were 16 preterm infants; birth weight, 900-1900 g; gestational wk, 27-34; corrected postmenstrual age at time of investigation, 33-36 wk. Heart rate, thoracic movements, and transcutaneous blood gases were monitored continuously. Cerebral blood volume decreased in 5 of 14 infants after sucrose and in 6 of 14 infants after placebo (difference not significant).</s><s>Preterm and acutely ill term neonates who are hospitalized in a neonatal intensive care unit are subjected to multiple frequent invasive and painful procedures aimed at improving their outcome. Significant differences in pain response existed among treatment groups (F = 22.49, p <.001), with the lowest mean Premature Infant Pain Profile scores in the sucrose and nonnutritive sucking group. Efficacy of sucrose following a heel lance was not affected by severity of illness, postnatal age, or number of painful procedures. Intervention group and sex explained 12% of the variance in Premature Infant Pain Profile scores. Few adverse events occurred (n = 6), and none of them required medical or nursing interventions.</s><s>Despite local anaesthetic drops, infants find eye examinations distressing, displaying behavioural and physiological changes indicating acute pain. To evaluate the use of oral sucrose and/or pacifier for reducing pain responses during eye examinations. Mean PIPP scores were 15.3, 14.3, 12.3, and 12.1 for groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. There was no difference between groups receiving sucrose and those receiving water (p = 0.321). The difference in response was large enough to be detected by a validated assessment tool.</s><s>To assess the efficacy of oral sucrose combined with swaddling and non-nutritive suck (NNS) as a method for reducing pain associated with retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) screening. The intervention group were swaddled, and received 0.2 ml of sucrose 24% given by mouth using a syringe and a soother. Fewer infants experienced episodes of desaturations or bradycardia in the intervention group (1 vs 4, p=0.18). Sucrose combined with NNS and swaddling reduced the behavioural and physiological pain responses. However, pain scores remained consistently high and appropriate pain relief for ROP screening remains a challenge.</s><s>The purpose of this study was to identify the least painful circumcision method. The infants were circumcised with either the Mogen or the Gomco procedure and were given a sweetened pacifier or a pacifier dipped in water. All infants had a eutectic mixture of local anesthetic cream applied before circumcision. Infants who were circumcised with the Mogen procedure cried and grimaced far less than infants who were circumcised with the Gomco procedure (P =.0001).</s><s>The aim of the study was to determine if pain and distress during the retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) screening examination could be ameliorated by providing comfort care. Fourteen study infants were swaddled, held, and given 24% sucrose solution during the examination. Vital signs (i.e., pulse rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation), crying time, and time for the vital signs to return to baseline values were recorded at different times during the examination. The participants in the control group had a trend of longer crying time, but this trend did not reach a level of statistical significance.</s><s>To determine whether an oral sucrose solution improves pain response for infants undergoing bladder catheterization in an emergency department (ED) population. A randomized, double-blinded study comparing the analgesic effects of a sucrose solution to placebo for infants < or = 90 days of age and requiring bladder catheterization. Infants with prior bladder catheterization, previous painful procedures that day, or neurological or genital abnormalities were excluded. Infants older than 30 days of age who received sucrose did not show statistically significant differences in pain scores, crying, or time to return to baseline behavior. There was no overall treatment effect when using an oral sucrose solution before bladder catheterization in infants younger than 90 days of age. However, infants younger than or equal to 30 days of age who received sucrose had smaller increases in pain scores, less crying, and returned to baseline more rapidly than infants receiving placebo.</s><s>This study aimed to compare the effects of mother's milk, sucrose and pacifier use to overcome pain during painful interventions to the newborns on the crying time and pain. Various non-pharmacological methods are used to overcome the pain associated with painful interventions with newborns. A prospective, randomised, controlled study involved 120 newborns in Turkey. Data collection was performed using an information form on the newborn characteristics, which was developed by the researchers in the light of literature, clinical IR ear thermometer ET1 for temperature measurement, OXIMAX N-65 Pulse oxymeter for oxygen saturation and heart rate and neonatal infant pain scale for the measurement of the behavioural responses of newborns. The results indicate that all three practices reduce the behavioural responses to pain at a higher rate than in the control group.</s><s>To determine the relative effectiveness of liposomal lidocaine, sucrose, and their combination for reducing pain in term newborns. Ours was a double-blind, randomized, controlled, double-dummy trial of 330 healthy term newborns. Local skin reactions were not observed, and the incidence of spitting up did not differ between sucrose-exposed and non-sucrose-exposed infants (1.4% vs 2.7%, respectively; P = .22). Sucrose was more effective than liposomal lidocaine for reducing pain during venipuncture in newborns. The addition of liposomal lidocaine to sucrose did not confer any additional benefit to sucrose alone.</s><s>To assess and compare the analgesic effects of orally administered glucose and sucrose and pacifiers. Randomised prospective study with validated behavioural acute pain rating scale. Mann-Whitney U test P values for comparisons of 30% glucose, 30% sucrose, pacifier, and 30% sucrose plus pacifier versus placebo (sterile water) were 0.005, 0.01, <0.0001, and <0.0001, respectively. The association of sucrose and pacifier showed a trend towards lower scores compared with pacifiers alone. These simple and safe interventions should be widely used for minor procedures in neonates.</s><s>The analgesic effect of oral sucrose in newborn infants undergoing painful procedures is generally accepted. Without sucrose, the NFCS score was higher in the HL group than the VP group during blood sampling (median 58 v 23, p<0.001). Crying and the total procedure time showed the same trends as the NFCS score. VP is less painful and more effective than HL for blood sampling in newborn infants. Although oral sucrose may have an additive analgesic effect, it is not necessarily required if VP is used for blood sampling.</s><s>To determine whether milk and its components reduce crying in newborns during and after blood collection for phenylketonuria evaluation. Seventy-two normal newborns ingested 2 mL of milk (Similac), Ross Special Formula, fat, protein, lactose, sucrose, or water for the 2 minutes preceding blood collection via heel lance. Sucrose and Similac each reduced crying during the blood collection procedure.</s><s>To identify the basis of sucking-induced analgesia in healthy, term, newborn humans undergoing the painful, routine, procedure of heel lance and blood collection. To evaluate how taste-induced and sucking-induced analgesias combine to combat pain. To determine whether facial grimacing was an accurate index of diminished pain, or whether it was linked to tissue trauma. The combination of sucrose and nonnutritive sucking was remarkably analgesic; we saw no behavioral indication in nine of the ten infants that the heel lance had even occurred.</s><s>We assessed whether sucrose administration reduces pain-specific brain and spinal cord activity after an acute noxious procedure in newborn infants. In this double-blind, randomised controlled trial, 59 newborn infants at University College Hospital (London, UK) were randomly assigned to receive 0·5 mL 24% sucrose solution or 0·5 mL sterile water 2 min before undergoing a clinically required heel lance. Randomisation was by a computer-generated randomisation code, and researchers, clinicians, participants, and parents were masked to the identity of the solutions. The primary outcome was pain-specific brain activity evoked by one time-locked heel lance, recorded with electroencephalography and identified by principal component analysis. Nociceptive brain activity after the noxious heel lance did not differ significantly between infants who received sucrose and those who received sterile water (sucrose: mean 0·10, 95% CI 0·04-0·16; sterile water: mean 0·08, 0·04-0·12; p=0·46). No significant difference was recorded between the sucrose and sterile water groups in the magnitude or latency of the spinal nociceptive reflex withdrawal recorded from the biceps femoris of the stimulated leg.</s><s>The aim of the present study was to examine the efficacy and potential side effects of repeated doses of oral sucrose for pain relief during procedures in NICU. Thirty-three preterm neonates were randomly allocated in blind fashion into two groups, the sucrose group (SG=17) and the control group (CG=16). During the next three days, the SG received oral sucrose (25%; 0.5 ml/kg) and the CG received sterile water, 2 min before each minor acute painful procedure. The neonates' facial activity (NFCS), behavioral state, and heart rate were evaluated. There were significantly fewer SG neonates with facial actions signaling pain than CG neonates in P (ass.2) and in A (ass.3). There was no statistical difference between-groups for physiological response. The efficacy of sucrose was maintained for pain relief in preterm neonates with no side effects.</s><s>To investigate the soothing effect of feeding on infants in distress, the effects of 2 mL 15% and 1 mL 25% sucrose given orally 2 min before heel prick in fasting preterms to reduce the pain response were assessed. The effects of milk intake by nasogastric tube were also assessed once during the last hour before heel prick, and the effects of milk intake by nasogastric tube once during the last hour before heel prick together with 1 mL 25% sucrose given orally 2 min before heel prick. The pain response was measured as changes in crying time, behavioural state, skin conductance and heart rate. Differences in the measured variables before and during heel prick showed that only the crying time was reduced when the infants received milk or 25% sucrose prior to heel prick (p < 0.05).</s><s>To determine the efficacy of 25% oral sucrose in the reduction of pain during a heel lance procedure in sick hospitalized infants. Facial scores immediately upon heel lance, and at 1 and 2 min in the recovery period were reduced in the treatment (sucrose) group compared to the placebo (water) group (P < 0.05). At other observation points, the differences in facial scores between the two groups of infants did not reach statistical significance. In the 3-min recovery period following completion of the blood collection, incidence and duration of crying were significantly less in the treatment group of infants (P < 0.05).</s><s>Procedural pain management for very low birth weight (VLBW) neonates has been minimal or nonexistent in most neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). The pacifier with sucrose (F = 24.09, p < .0001) and pacifier with sterile water (F = 9.00, p = .003) significantly reduced pain. Frequency of painful procedures approached significance in influencing pain response (F = 3.59, p = .01). Research on the efficacy and safety of implementing these interventions, alone and in combination, for repeated painful procedures is needed.</s><s>To compare the analgesic effects of non nutritive pacifier sucking, oral administration of a 30% saccharose solution, local application of Emla and their association for subcutaneous injection of erythropoietin (EPO) in preterm infants. For each consecutive EPO injection, patients were randomised between four groups of intervention: non nutritive pacifier sucking (T), oral administration of 0.2-0.5 ml of a 30% saccharose solution with non nutritive pacifier sucking (S), local application of Emla with non nutritive pacifier sucking (E), and oral administration of 0.2-0.5 ml of a 30% saccharose solution with local application of Emla and with non nutritive pacifier sucking (S + E).

To examine whether the addition of sucrose 24% to topical anesthetic improves procedural pain control during the ROP eye examination. In a subsequent eye examination, each patient received the alternate treatment. Twenty-three infants were studied, with 12 receiving sucrose and 11 receiving placebo as the first treatment. For 3 of the 5 definitions of pain response, patients experienced significantly less pain at speculum insertion with sucrose than with placebo.</s><s>Reports that sweet taste calms crying in newborns and is analgesic against the pain caused by a heel lance served as the basis for this study. Electroencephalographic (EEG) activity, heart rate activity, and infants' facial behaviors were recorded before and after a noninvasive, but noxious, heelstroke (procedure from the Brazelton Neonatal Behavior Assessment Scale). However, after the heelstroke, the heart rate of infants who received sucrose returned to baseline, whereas the heart rate of infants who tasted water remained elevated. These findings add to the growing literature showing that sucrose attenuates newborns' negative response to aversive or noxious stimuli.</s><s>The purpose of this work was to compare the efficacy of breastfeeding versus orally administered sucrose solution in reducing pain response during blood sampling through heel lance. METHODS; We conducted an open-label, randomized, controlled trial at a neonatal unit of a public hospital in northern Italy on 101 term neonates undergoing heel lance with an automated piercing device for routine neonatal screening for congenital disorders. The median heart rate increase, oxygen saturation decrease, and duration of first cry for the breastfeeding group were, respectively, 13.0, -1, and 3 and for sucrose group were 22, -3, and 21. There were no significant differences in the sampling duration and numbers of heel lances.</s><s>Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of local anesthetic eye drops and a pacifier, plus repeated doses of 24% sucrose, to relieve pain associated with eye examinations for retinopathy of prematurity. Treatment effectiveness was determined using a validated infant pain measure, the Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP), which includes measures of facial expressions, heart rate, and oxygen saturation and takes behavioral state and gestational age into consideration. Data were collected before, during, and following an examination of the left eye. No significant differences were found in PIPP scores immediately following the procedure.</s><s>To explore techniques that can be utilized in addition to the dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) to further reduce the neonate's stress and pain from routine circumcision, and thus make the procedure more humane. Eighty healthy, term, newborn male infants scheduled for routine neonatal circumcision. Prospective and randomized; double blind and placebo controlled for the study solutions. Each study group differed from the controls in one variable including: 1) using a specially designed, physiologic circumcision restraint chair; 2) pH buffering of lidocaine hydrochloride used for DPNB; and 3) offering a pacifier dipped in a 24% sucrose solution during the DPNB and circumcision. Behavioral observations were recorded and compared for each group starting before the injection of lidocaine hydrochloride and continuing through the completion of the circumcision. The infants who were injected with the buffered lidocaine showed no differences in distress from the controls. When neonatal circumcisions are performed routinely, they should be done as humanely as possible.</s><s>To assess the effectiveness of sucrose as an analgesic agent during routine immunization injections for infants (age range, 2 weeks to 18 months). A consecutive sample of 285 infants were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups. Results were analyzed by using two-way repeated measure analyses of variance. Two-week-old infants who received either the sterile water or sucrose solution cried significantly less than infants who received no intervention (F=5.92,P<.005). In addition, the results suggest that in the absence of nonnutritive sucking, the actual analgesic effects of sucrose may be nonspecific.</s><s>Oral sucrose analgesia for preterm infant venepuncture.</s><s>The purpose of this randomized clinical trial was to test the efficacy of repeated versus single dose sucrose to decrease pain from routine heel stick procedures in preterm neonates.

The infants were randomized to receive up to three doses of 0.1 ml of either 24% sucrose or sterile water (placebo) for every painful procedure during the 1st week of life. The hypotheses were that infants who received 24% sucrose for all painful procedures would be less stressed as measured by salivary cortisol, and more physiologically stable as measured by pulse rate variability than those who received placebo. There was, however, a significant correlation between standard deviation of pulse rate and number of doses of sucrose only in the group who received high doses of sucrose.</s><s>Sucrose is widely used to manage procedural pain in term newborns despite a lack of evidence of its effectiveness for different procedures and infant populations. Our objectives were to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of sucrose in newborns undergoing various medical procedures within 2 days of birth. We included newborns (>or= 36 weeks gestation) of diabetic mothers and nondiabetic mothers. We included 240 newborns (120 from diabetic mothers, 120 from nondiabetic mothers). During venipuncture, newborns who received sucrose had lower pain scores compared with those who received a placebo (newborns of nondiabetic mothers: mean difference -3.2, 95% CI -4.6 to -1.8; newborns of diabetic mothers: mean difference -2.4, 95% CI -3.8 to -1.0). However, when each procedure was analyzed separately, we found that the effectiveness of sucrose was limited to venipuncture for the newborn screening test.</s><s>Gavage feeding is required in preterm infants who cannot feed by themselves. Insertion of the feeding tube is painful, and reducing the discomfort in these patients is desirable. We included 24 preterm infants with postmenstrual age 28 to 32 weeks' who were in stable condition. Each infant acted as his or her own control over a 3-week period during which the tube was changed 6 times. Pain and discomfort were assessed by at least 2 independent and experienced observers using a pain assessment tool, the Premature Infant Pain Profile; score range: 0 to 21. Insertion of a feeding tube in preterm infants leads to a measurable degree of pain and discomfort, according to the Premature Infant Pain Profile assessment tool.</s><s>To evaluate the effectiveness of oral sucrose in the prevention of pain-induced crying in preterm infants, a sample of 28 healthy neonates (15M, 13F; gestational age at procedure less than 37 weeks) who were having routine blood drawn by arm venipuncture was studied. Infants were randomly allocated to receive by mouth, using a syringe, 2 ml of one of three solutions: spring water (group W) and sucrose 12 and 24% w/v (groups S12 and S24, respectively), all in water vehicle. After 2 min, while awake, arm venipuncture was performed and duration of crying was measured. The time spent crying was reduced in the group treated with the sweetest solution (S24, n = 8, mean = 19.1 s).</s><s>To understand how the 'caregiving context' could affect responses to procedural pain, the authors sought to determine whether (1) the combined effects of sweet taste and holding (caregiving contact) were greater than the effects of either alone, (2) any combined effects were additive or interactive, and (3) the interventions had similar effects on behavioral (crying and facial activity) and physiological (heart rate, vagal tone) responses to the heel-stick procedure in newborn infants in a randomized two-factorial intervention trial. Infants were randomized in blocks of eight to receive (1) no holding and water taste (control participants), (2) no holding and sucrose taste (sucrose group), (3) holding and water taste (holding group), or (4) holding and sucrose taste (holding and sucrose group). Consequently, sweet taste and holding interventions combined in complex ways when acting on different behavioral and physiological response systems to modify stressful pain experiences.</s><s>Feeding and carrying have been interventions used by caregivers throughout history in relieving distress in infants. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of sucrose and simulated rocking alone and in combination on diminishing pain response in preterm neonates undergoing routine heelstick procedure in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Preterm infants (n = 85) between 25-34 weeks post-conceptual age (PCA) and 2-10 days postnatal age (PNA) were randomly assigned to one of four conditions for routine heelstick procedure. Physiological (heart rate) and behavioural (facial actions) responses from baseline across 90 s following heelstick were scored second-to-second. The groups that received sucrose alone or in combination with simulated rocking showed less facial actions indicative of pain than the rocking alone or control group. The addition of rocking to the sucrose condition tended to further blunt the facial expression of pain, but this enhancement did not reach a significant level. Heart rate was not decreased by any intervention compared to the control condition.</s><s>To evaluate the pain in healthy newborns requiring blood test by a heel-prick procedure and compare different pain management methods. The first group of 50 newborns, received no specific analgesic intervention during blood tests, except our usual nursing intervention (\"facilitated tucking\"). The second and third group (50 newborns), received non-nutritive sucking-placebo and non-nutritive sucking-24% sucrose respectively. In the control group, the average score on the scale of discomfort was 3.92, moderate pain, causing a crying time of 51.72 seconds; the group receiving a non-nutritive sucking-placeboscored 2.1, slight pain, 10.68 seconds crying, while the group receiving non-nutritive sucking-24 % sucrose, expressed a level of discomfort of 1.5 points, slight, with an average crying time of 10.70 seconds.</s><s>To evaluate the effects of different sucrose concentrations on measures of neonatal pain. Randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial of sterile water (control) or one of three solutions of sucrose--namely, 12.5%, 25%, and 50% wt/vol. There was a significant trend for a reduction in crying time with increasing concentrations of sucrose over the first three minutes. Sucrose may be a useful and safe analgesic for minor procedures in neonates.</s><s>The aim of this study was to compare the analgesic effect of 2 ml 25% sucrose and human milk in a group of healthy term newborns. The median values of crying time, recovery time and percentage change in heart rate at 1, 2 and 3 min were recorded in response to the heel prick. Median crying times were 36, 52, and 62 s in the sucrose, placebo and human milk groups, respectively (P = 0.0009). In the sucrose group, there was a significant reduction in crying time compared to human milk and placebo groups.</s><s>In this study, we aimed to compare the analgesic effect of 30% sucrose and 10% and 30% glucose in a group of healthy term newborns. A total of 113 infants whose heels were pricked for the guthrie test were included in the study. Response to pain was assessed by mean crying time, recovery time, maximum heart rate, and percent change in heart rate at 1, 2, and 3 minutes. Although mean recovery time was shorter in the sucrose group (102 seconds), there was neither a significant difference between the groups (10% glucose, 121 seconds; 30% glucose, 109 seconds; control group, 132 seconds [P =.09]), Nor was there a difference in maximum heart rate and percent change in heart rate at 1, 2, and 3 minutes after heel prick (P =.14, P =.05, P =.53 For the first, second, and third minutes, respectively ).

Sucrose (0.1 mL of 24%) or sterile water was administered orally up to 3 times, 2 minutes apart, for every invasive procedure during a 7-day period. Motor development and vigor, and alertness and orientation components of the Neurobehavioral Assessment of the Preterm Infant were measured at 32, 36, and 40 weeks' PCA; Score for Neonatal Acute Physiology was measured on the last day of intervention; and Neuro-Biological Risk Score (NBRS) was measured at 2 weeks of age and at discharge. Primary analyses of covariance were applied for each outcome to compare group differences followed by secondary analyses using standard linear regression within each group to determine predictors of outcomes. Although there were no differences between the groups on any outcomes, there were significant dose-related effects within each group.</s><s>Infants undergoing eye exams to screen for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) demonstrate physiologic and behavioral manifestations of pain and distress. Outcome measures included HR, RR, O(2) saturation, BP, pain (premature infant pain profile) and percent of time spent crying during the eye exam.

An experimental design examined pain responses of 84 newborns undergoing heelstick. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that the sugar-coated pacifier group demonstrated significantly lower vagal tone during heelstick than the oral sucrose solution and control groups.</s><s>Preterm neonates undergo numerous painful procedures in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Sucrose, with and without pacifiers, is effective and safe for relieving pain from single painful events. However, repeated use of sucrose for multiple painful procedures has not been adequately evaluated.

In the group of 20 patients that received the drug, 4 patients (20%) showed a complete remission, and 12 patients (60%) had a good or partial response to topical treatment.</s><s>There is one case report in which aloe vera (AV) was used successfully in the treatment of lichen planus. Fifty-four consecutive patients (34 women and 20 men) participated in the study. Twenty-two of 27 patients treated with AV (81%) had a good response after 8 weeks of treatment, while one of 27 placebo-treated patients (4%) had a similar response (P<0.001). Burning pain completely disappeared in nine patients treated with AV (33%) and in one treated with placebo (4%) (P=0.005). Therefore, AV gel can be considered a safe alternative treatment for patients with OLP.</s><s>Objective: We compared tacrolimus 0.1% ointment and clobetasol 0.05% ointment for the treatment of OLP. Pain severity, burning sensation, and mucosal lesion extension were assessed using a four-point scale. The results of this study suggest that tacrolimus 0.1% ointment is more effective than clobetasol propionate 0.05% ointment in the treatment of OLP. However, other studies are needed to confirm the effectiveness of this treatment before it can be recommended for use in clinical practice.</s><s>Several drugs have been used with varying results, but most treatments are empirical, and do not have adequate control groups or correct study designs. To compare the effectiveness of clobetasol and ciclosporin in the topical management of OLP and to evaluate which is more cost-effective and which gives the longest remission from signs and symptoms. Forty consecutive patients were divided into two groups to receive clobetasol propionate or ciclosporin for 2 months. Two months after the end of therapy, 33% of clobetasol-treated patients and 77% of ciclosporin-treated patients were stable (P = 0.04). Conversely, clobetasol gives less stable results than ciclosporin when therapy ends and has shown a higher incidence of side-effects.</s><s>Symptomatic oral lichen planus (OLP) has been palliated with a wide spectrum of topical and systemic therapies. The dosage was 50 microg two dose unit sprays and BSP 500 microg, each 4 times daily. Symptomatic improvement was evaluated by means of a visual analogue scale (VAS), the McGill pain score, the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP), and Oral Health Quality of Life (OHQoL) questionnaires. The efficacy, ease of application, and adverse effects associated with each medication were recorded. There was no significant difference between the two corticosteroids in their efficacy in reducing painful symptoms (measured by the VAS) or in their effect on patient quality of life. However, FP was statistically significantly better than BSP in reducing lesion surface area. FP and BSP are both effective in the short-term clinical management of symptomatic OLP. FP is more acceptable to patients than BSP because of the convenience of the spray form.</s><s>Numerous drugs have been used with dissimilar results, but most treatments are empirical and do not have adequate control groups or correct study designs. In all, 14 of the 15 clobetasol 0.025% patients (93%) and 13 of the 15 clobetasol 0.05% patients (87%), had symptoms improvement after 2 months of therapy (P = 0.001 in both groups). No statistical differences were found in comparing the two different formulations. A larger concentration of the active molecules cannot further improve the therapeutic findings or optimize the obtained results in a significant manner.</s><s>Topical steroids are the first choice for the treatment of oral lichen planus (OLP). To compare the effect of clobetasol propionate with and without a topical antifungal drug (miconazole) on the symptoms and extension of OLP. A randomized, parallel, double-blind trial was conducted at the Unit of Oral Medicine and Pathology of the University of Milan. Primary outcomes included symptoms and extension of lesions; adverse effects were also recorded. All the patients who concluded the study (30 of 35) showed clinical and subjective improvement within 3 weeks. Although effective in preventing iatrogenic candidosis, the addition of miconazole to topical steroid treatment does not improve the efficacy of the therapy.</s><s>We studied the efficacy of curcuminoids in the treatment of oral lichen planus (OLP), a chronic, mucocutaneous, immunological disease. Curcuminoids are components of turmeric (Curcuma longa) that have anti-inflammatory activity. The first interim analysis was conducted in October 2004 using data from the first 33 subjects. Secondary outcomes were changes in clinical signs and occurrence of side effects. The first interim analysis did not show a significant difference between the placebo and curcuminoids groups. Conditional power calculations suggested a less than 2% chance that the curcuminoids group would have a significantly better outcome as compared with the placebo group if the trial were continued to completion. Curcuminoids at this dose were well tolerated and the results suggest that for future studies a larger sample size, a higher dose and/or longer duration of curcuminoids administration should be considered; however, for the next step, an RCT of a shorter duration, using a higher dose of curcuminoids, and without an initial course of prednisone, should be considered.</s><s>It is frequently palliated with topical or systemic corticosteroids and retinoids. These treatments require prolonged use, however, and are not always effective. Cyclosporine levels present in specimens of oral mucosa at the end of therapy four hours after the patients swished were similar to the levels previously reported in psoriatic lesions after treatment with systemic cyclosporine (14 mg per kilogram of body weight per day). As a topical preparation, cyclosporine may be useful in the treatment of oral lichen planus and possibly other cutaneous disorders.</s><s>To evaluate the efficacy of 1% pimecrolimus cream in treating oral erosive lichen planus and to assess its tolerance. Outpatients of the Department of Dermatology, University Hospital of Nice, from December 21, 2004, to April 19, 2005. Of the 14 patients, 2 did not meet the inclusion criteria and 12 were enrolled in the trial. The intervention was 1% pimecrolimus cream or its vehicle, which was applied on ulcerated lesions twice a day for 4 weeks. The efficacy of the treatment was quantified using a 12-point clinical score. In the pimecrolimus group, the mean score was 6.83 on day 0 vs 3.33 on day 28 (P = .04). Pimecrolimus cream was well tolerated, and only transient burning sensations were reported by some subjects. The 1% pimecrolimus cream seems to be an effective and well-tolerated treatment for oral erosive lichen planus.</s><s>Topical application of clobetasol-17-propionate has been diffusely reported as an efficacious therapy in atrophic/erosive oral lichen planus (OLP), without exposing the patient to systemic side-effects. However, prolonged contact and respective topical effects on the oral mucosa should be avoided. The aim of the present study was to evaluate efficacy and compliance of new lipid microspheres loaded with 0.025% of clobetasol propionate (formulation A) compared with a commonly used formulation (a sort of dispersion of a lipophilic ointment in a hydrophilic phase) with the same amount of drug (formulation B) in the topical treatment of OLP. Fifty patients with symptomatic OLP were enrolled in a controlled single-blind phase IV clinical trial. After a dropout of five patients, a total of 45 patients [12 males and 33 females; mean age 61.1 years (+/- 12.3 SD; range 25-82)] were treated (17 with formulation A and 28 with formulation B, matched for gender and age; P > 0.2) with the same dosage regimen.</s><s>Lichen planus is a common chronic inflammatory mucocutaneous disease, affecting 0.1% to 4% of the general population. In this investigator-blinded parallel-group randomized clinical trial, 40 patients were randomly assigned in two equal groups to receive either pimecrolimus 1% cream or triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% paste 4 times daily for a total of 2 months and followed up for another 2 months. The patients were assessed for painful symptoms measured by visual analog scale, the Oral Health Impact Profile score, and objective clinical score. Eighteen patients in pimecrolimus group and 17 patients in triamcinolone group finished the 4-month trial course. There was no significant difference between changes from baseline median values of pimecrolimus and triamcinolone groups after treatment termination in terms of visual analog scale score (-9.8 +/- 11.3 vs -8.4 +/- 18.3, P = .70), Oral Health Impact Profile score (-1.5 +/- 2.6 vs -1.6 +/- 2.1, P = .38), and clinical score (-0.7 +/- 0.6 vs -0.8 +/- 0.7, P = .86), respectively. This study showed that patients with OLP may benefit from both topical pimecrolimus and triamcinolone acetonide therapy with minimal side effects.</s>"

We estimated efficacy by comparing the attack rate of typhoid in the vaccine group with that in the placebo group. S. typhi was isolated from 4 of the 5525 children who were fully vaccinated with Vi-rEPA and from 47 of the 5566 children who received both injections of placebo (efficacy, 91.5 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 77.1 to 96.6; P<0.001). Among the 771 children who received only one injection, there was 1 case of typhoid in the vaccine group and 8 cases in the placebo group.

A double-blinded, randomized field trial was performed in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in south-western China, using 30 micrograms doses of locally produced Vi. Clinically suspected cases of typhoid fever were confirmed by blood culture, or by serological reaction with O-antigen (Widal tests). Most of the isolates were from school-aged children: 22 cases in the placebo group versus 6 in the Vi group (PE = 72%; 95% CI = 32%, 82%).

In the pilot study, involving 274 Nepalese, there were no significant side effects of the Vi vaccine; about 75 percent responded with a rise in serum antibodies of fourfold or more. In the clinical trial, residents of five villages were given intramuscular injections of either Vi or, as a control, pneumococcus vaccine dispensed in coded, randomly arranged, single-dose syringes. There were 6907 participants, of whom 6438 were members of the target population (5 to 44 years of age); each was visited every two days.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of nebulized terbutaline in bronchiolitis as measured by improvement in clinical score, oxygen saturation or reduction in duration of hospitalization. Outcome measurements included: Respiratory Distress Assessment Instrument (RDAI) score, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, heart rate and the duration of hospitalization. Nebulized terbutaline therapy does not appear effective in treating moderately ill infants with the first acute bronchiolitis.</s><s>Thirty-two infants, aged 1 to 12 months, hospitalized with acute wheezing, were studied. They were randomly divided into four treatment groups of eight patients each. Average daily improvements, as reflected by changes in the clinical score and length of hospital stay, was essentially the same for infants treated with placebo, salbutamol alone, and dexamethasone alone. A potentiating effect of corticosteroids on the beta-adrenergic responsiveness is a possible explanation for the advantage of this combined treatment in the management of acute wheezing in infancy.</s><s>The benefit of beta-adrenergic agonists in the treatment of acutely wheezing infants and young children has not been well documented in the outpatient setting. To determine the efficacy of nebulized metaproterenol sulfate, 74 children aged 36 months or younger with acute wheezing participated in a double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Children received nebulized metaproterenol, either as an initial treatment or after a control treatment with normal saline solution. After metaproterenol therapy, children demonstrated an increase in heart rate ([mean +/- SD] 147 +/- 14 beats per minute vs 153 +/- 16 beats per minute), a decrease in respirations (50/min +/- 5/min vs 45/min +/- 7/min), improvement (lower scores) on the RDI (24 +/- 4 vs 15 +/- 2), and an increase in oxygen saturation (94.1% +/- 2.7% vs 95.3% +/- 3.0%). Patients aged 12 months or younger (n = 37) benefited from metaproterenol treatment (improvement in respiratory rate and RDI) but not to the same degree as children aged 24 months or older (n = 23) (improvement in respiratory rate, RDI, and oxygen saturation).</s><s>A wide range of drugs are commonly used to treat bronchiolitis, but evidence of their effectiveness is limited. Sixty-nine infants with moderate-severe bronchiolitis hospitalized at their first episode of wheezing or crepitations in the chest were enrolled in a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients were randomly assigned to receive nebulized salbutamol, ipratropium bromide or placebo. In the bronchodilator groups, clinical scores were better compared to the placebo group at 30 min (8.4 +/- 1.3 vs. 7.5 +/- 0.8, p < 0.05). Clinical scores and oxygen saturation levels improved more rapidly in the bronchodilator groups than in the placebo group up to 24 h, but these drugs did not have a sufficient effect to change the natural course of the disease.</s><s>The main purpose of this study was to evaluate four different forms of treatment in young infants admitted for acute wheezing (AW). Seventy-nine infants less than one year of age were randomly assigned to one of five groups. However, the nebulized bronchodilator treatments were more effective than aminophylline IV in decreasing scores on the first day, and they resulted in shorter hospitalization.</s><s>To determine the efficacy of oral salbutamol for providing symptomatic relief in mild bronchiolitis. There was no significant difference in mean duration of fever, cough, coryza, noisy breathing, time to achieve normal feeding and normal sleep; and frequency of hospitalization or adverse effects, between the two groups.However, tremors were observed in 5 infants in the salbutamol group.</s><s>In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 40 infants between 6 weeks and 24 months of age who had a first episode of wheezing and other signs and symptoms of bronchiolitis were randomly assigned to receive either nebulized albuterol (0.15 mg/kg/dose) or placebo (saline solution) for two administrations 1 hour apart. The albuterol therapy resulted in a significantly greater improvement in the accessory muscle score (decreases 0.70 vs decreases 0.30; p = 0.03), oxygen saturation (increases 0.71% vs decreases 0.47%; p = 0.01) after one dose, and in the accessory muscle score (decreases 0.86 vs decreases 0.37; p = 0.02), respiratory rate (decreases 19.6% vs decreases 8.0%; p = 0.016), and oxygen saturation (increases 0.76% vs decreases 0.79%; p = 0.015) after two doses of the drug. The response to therapy was similar in infants younger and those older than 6 months of age. We conclude that nebulized albuterol constitutes a safe and effective treatment of infants with bronchiolitis.</s><s>To determine whether oral albuterol is effective in reducing symptomatology of acute viral bronchiolitis in infants with mild-to-moderate illness. In a randomized, double-blind trial, previously well infants were randomized upon discharge from the emergency department to receive either albuterol (0.1 mg/kg/dose) three times per day or placebo three times per day for 7 days. The overall mean age was 5.3 months, 60% were male, and 49 of 61 tested infants were positive for respiratory syncytial virus. The widespread use of oral albuterol in this patient group is not recommended.</s><s>In previously well infants hospitalized with acute viral bronchiolitis, the effectiveness of repeated nebulized therapy with epinephrine (EPI) was compared with treatment with albuterol (ALB) or saline placebo (PLAC). There were no group differences in the primary outcome measure, mean LOS (hours)(+/- SD): EPI = 59.8 (62), ALB = 61.4 (54), and PLAC = 63.3 (47); P =.95 by intent-to-treat analysis. Group differences were not statistically significant in any of the secondary outcomes.

One hundred and fifty-six infants aged between 7 weeks and 24 months who had had an episode of wheezing and other signs and symptoms of bronchiolitis were randomized to three groups as follows: (i) nebulized salbutamol was administered to 52 patients in group I at a dose of 0.15 mg/kg in 2 mL saline; (ii) saline was nebulized to 52 patients in group II and (iii) in group III 52 patients received mist in a tent. Treatment was repeated with the same agent after 30 min if the respiratory score was 5 or more. Oxygen saturation decreased in group I without reaching statistical significance.

We enrolled 186 children (mean age 9.5 +/- 5.3 months, range 1.5-24 months, 65.1% male) with a first episode of wheezing diagnosed as mild bronchiolitis in emergency department. After discharge, patients were reassessed by telephone contact at 48 hr and 6 months.

Assessment after each treatment included a wheeze and retraction score, respiratory and heart rates, and pulse oximetry. After two treatments, there was a significant improvement in the wheeze scores (P less than 0.05) and total scores (P less than 0.05) of the albuterol group compared with the placebo group. There were no significant differences between the two groups in heart rate or respiratory rate.</s><s>Our objective was to determine if nebulized racemic epinephrine is more efficacious than nebulized albuterol or saline placebo in the treatment of bronchiolitis in the outpatient setting when dosing is equivalent in terms of beta-2 agonist potency. Secondary outcome measures were changes in clinical scores and oxygen saturations. There were no significant statistical differences between groups in terms of need for hospital admission or outpatient management with home oxygen therapy.</s><s>To evaluate the effect of nebulized albuterol on tidal breathing flow-volume loops in infants with bronchiolitis due to respiratory syncytial virus. Tidal breathing flow-volume loops were obtained before and after each aerosol treatment with a Neonatal/Pediatric Pulmonary Testing System (Model 2600; Sensor Medics, Anaheim, CA, USA). The PTEF, the tidal expiratory flows at 10%, 25%, and 50% of the remaining tidal volume (TEF10, TEF25, and TEF50), and the wheeze score were also determined. There were no significant changes in VPTEF/VE and tPTEF/tE after albuterol or saline treatment. All other investigated variables were not significantly affected by aerosol administration. Nebulized albuterol in infants with mild bronchiolitis due to respiratory syncytial virus did not improve VPTEF/VE and tPTEF/tE but did decrease TEF10 and 25/PT.</s><s>To determine whether the use of albuterol by nebulization enhances physiologic or clinical recovery in hospitalized infants with moderate bronchiolitis. This prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial was performed from December 1995 to March 1996. Primary outcome measures included improvement in oxygen saturation (SaO2) during hospitalization and survival analysis to assess the time required to reach preestablished discharge criteria on three measures: SaO2, accessory muscle use, and wheezing. There was no significant difference in mean SaO2 between albuterol and placebo at baseline, 24 hours, or maximum SaO2 achieved during hospitalization. Both groups showed significant improvement in oxygen saturation over time, but there was no significant difference in improvement between the two groups.</s><s>Much controversy revolves around the efficacy of bronchodilators in the treatment of bronchiolitis. All children less than 2 years old with bronchiolitis were randomly assigned to receive nebulisations of Salbutamol, Ipratropium bromide or normal saline. A fourth group given only humidified oxygen without nebulisation were used as a control. The use of bronchodilators did not alter the course of the disease and is therefore not effective in the treatment of bronchiolitis.</s><s>A randomised double blind trial was conducted to determine the efficacy of inhaled bronchodilators, salbutamol and ipratropium bromide, compared with placebo in the treatment of bronchiolitis. The four groups were similar in demographic characteristics, initial oxygenation, and clinical score. The change in oxygen saturation of recipients of both agents was significantly better than that of recipients of salbutamol alone or ipratropium bromide alone.</s><s>Inhaled sympathomimetic agents are often used in bronchiolitis with little objective evidence of benefit. The fall in SaO2 with salbutamol was seen whether infants received it as the first or second nebulisation. The decrease in SaO2 was greater and more prolonged with salbutamol than with saline. Routine nebulised aerosol sympathomimetic treatment during acute bronchiolitis cannot be recommended.</s><s>To test whether nebulized salbutamol (albuterol) is safe and efficacious for the treatment of young children with acute bronchiolitis, we enrolled 83 children (median age 6 months, range 1 to 21 months) in a randomized, double-blind clinical trial. Participants received two treatments at 30-minute intervals of either nebulized salbutamol (0.10 mg/kg in 2 ml 0.9% saline solution) or a similar volume of 0.9% saline solution placebo. There was no difference between the groups in oxygen saturation (p = 0.74); patients treated with salbutamol had a small increase in heart rate after two treatments (159 +/- 16 vs 151 +/- 16; p = 0.03). We conclude that salbutamol is safe and effective for the initial treatment of young children with acute bronchiolitis.</s><s>To study patients with respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis in respiratory failure to make specific measurements reflecting airway resistance before and after treatment with commonly used agents. Tertiary Pediatric Intensive Care Unit in a University affiliated hospital in the northeastern United States. Twenty-two patients with respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis and in respiratory failure were enrolled. There were small but statistically significant decreases in peak inspiratory pressure after racemic epinephrine treatment, levalbuterol, and racemic albuterol. Heart rate rose significantly after inhaled bronchodilator treatments (p < 0.05 for all treatments). However, side effects of bronchodilators, such as tachycardia, also occurred, and these may be clinically significant.</s><s>A randomized clinical trial was conducted on young children with bronchiolitis admitted to hospital with moderate illness to determine the efficacy of the bronchodilators Salbutamol and ipratropium bromide, either as a single drug or in combination, given as a nebulized solution, compared with a normal saline placebo. They were scored using the clinical parameters of wheezing, retractions and respiratory rate at enrollment, at 30 and 60 minutes after the first nebulization, and after 60 minutes following completion of subsequent nebulization at 6, 12, 24 and 36 hours. We did not find any significant difference in the rate of improvement and the final score (p = 0.49) in the four groups. The lengths of hospitalization in the four groups were also similar (p = 0.79).</s><s>To examine the efficacy of albuterol (0.15 mg/kg per dose) in the management of bronchiolitis. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled outpatient clinical trial utilizing four study groups: neubulized albuterol, nebulized saline, oral albuterol, and oral placebo. Pediatric emergency department and outpatient clinic at University of Maryland in Baltimore. Respiratory and heart rates, clinical score, oxygen saturation (Spo2), and the infant's state, ie, asleep, awake, or feeding, were recorded at baseline and at 30 and 60 minutes after treatment. No differences in the need for additional treatment or hospitalization were observed. Albuterol is as effective as oral placebo in the management of bronchiolitis.</s><s>The efficacy of albuterol in the management of infants with first-time wheezing is controversial. The nebulized therapy groups received two treatments 30 minutes apart; the oral therapy groups received one treatment. Chest radiographs, leukocyte counts, blood culture specimens, and nasal aspirate for viral antigen detection were obtained to confirm the clinical diagnosis of viral bronchiolitis. Nebulized albuterol significantly improved the clinical score and reduced the respiratory rate of those with recurrent wheezing relative to those in the randomized groups.</s>"

Ten public schools, which comprised 959 1st- and 2nd-grade students (54% male students, 18% minority, 28% low socioeconomic status), were matched and assigned randomly to either intervention or control conditions.</s><s>This study evaluated the effects of self-control skills intervention to prevent smoking with middle school subjects. Self-control skills subjects had better 15-month follow-up scores than subjects in the other two conditions on measures of communication, self-instruction, self-praise, cigarette refusals, and noncompliance to smoke. Self-control condition subjects reported less weekly cigarette smoking compared with placebo and control condition subjects at final follow-up.</s><s>This paper presents the student outcomes of a large-scale, social-influences-based, school and media-based tobacco use prevention and cessation project in Southern California. Control groups included \"treatment as usual\" and an \"attention control\" with the same outcome expectancies as the treatment conditions. We observed significant effects on mediating variables such as knowledge and prevalence estimates, and coping effort. The lack of behavioral effects may have been the result of imperfect program implementation or low base rates of intentions and behavior.</s><s>A six-year, school-based prevention program, which modified classroom teacher practices, offered parent training, and provided child social skills training, was evaluated for its effects on school failure, drug abuse, and delinquency among low-income urban children. The girls in the group also evidenced lower rates of substance use initiation, while the boys exhibited increased social and school work skills.</s><s>Reported are results of an independent effectiveness study of the Project ALERT drug prevention program implemented in eight Pennsylvania middle schools by outside program leaders employed by Cooperative Extension. Project ALERT's effectiveness was tested through a 3-level hierarchical linear model. Potential explanations for outcomes relative to Project ALERT's original effectiveness trial are discussed, as well as implications for future research, including the need to conduct independent effectiveness studies of previously validated programs in a variety of contexts.</s><s>A one year randomized controlled trial was used to evaluate the effectiveness of a smoking prevention programme designed by health educationalists for 10-12 year old primary schoolchildren. The study was carried out in the Hunter Region of New South Wales, Australia, using a sample of over 6000 children which would be large enough to detect, with high probability, differences of about 5% in smoking prevalence between the treatment and control groups. We report the results from the children surveyed in 1979 and 1980, before and after the programme was implemented. It was found that there were no significant differences in smoking behaviour between treatment and control groups. The programme's effectiveness varied with both the age and sex of the children. It was most successful among older girls, aged 11-12 years, for whom smoking prevalence rates increased from 10.7% in 1979 to 22.6% in 1980 in the treatment group compared with 6.2% to 26.8% in the control group.</s><s>How effective are peer-led programmes in preventing the uptake of smoking by children? In 1981, we conducted a randomized controlled trial of a school-based educational programme for the prevention of smoking in children who were in their seventh year at school. The children's perceived responses to cigarette advertising showed the strongest and most consistent evidence of an effect on the uptake of smoking by children who initially were non-smokers. After adjustment for the effects of other variables there was an excess of 15.0% (95% CL, 2.1%, 27.9%) in the prevalence rate of smoking after two years for girls who thought that they were influenced by advertising compared with those who did not. As smoking-prevention programmes only may delay the onset of smoking in children, it is important that legislative measures be introduced to reduce the effects of cigarette advertising.</s><s>To evaluate a multicultural smoking prevention curriculum, 16 schools were randomized to receive the multicultural curriculum or a standard curriculum and program effects on 1-year smoking initiation among 1430 never smokers were assessed. The prevention effect among Hispanic boys is encouraging, but additional research is needed to improve prevention effects among other groups.</s><s>The prevention of initiation of tobacco, alcohol and drug use is a major societal challenge, for which the existing research literature is generally disappointing. to prevent initiation of new substance use among non-users, and to reduce risks among existing users. Individualised MI was compared with standard practice classroom-delivered Drug Awareness intervention, both delivered over the course of one lesson. Unexpected lower levels of cannabis initiation and prevalence were found in the Drug Awareness control condition. This particular adaptation of MI is ineffective as a universal drug prevention intervention and does not merit further study.</s><s>Most drug abuse prevention research has been conducted with predominantly White middle-class adolescent populations. The prevention program taught drug refusal skills, antidrug norms, personal self-management skills, and general social skills in an effort to provide students with skills and information for resisting drug offers, to decrease motivations to use drugs, and decrease vulnerability to drug use social influences. The findings from this study show that a drug abuse prevention program originally designed for White middle-class adolescent populations is effective in a sample of minority, economically disadvantaged, inner-city adolescents.</s><s>To test the efficacy of implementation intentions in reducing smoking uptake in a sample of adolescents. Classes of adolescents (aged 11-12 years) were randomly allocated to one of four conditions: implementation intention, self-efficacy, two control conditions. There were no differences between the two control conditions and the self-efficacy condition. Controlling for baseline smoking, sex, attitudes to smoking, friends and family smoking, and the multilevel nature of the data, intention-to-treat analyses indicated the implementation intention manipulation significantly reduced self-reported smoking compared to the other three conditions combined.</s><s>In this article, we examine the impact of two universal, grade 1 preventive interventions on the onset of tobacco smoking as assessed in early adolescence. The family-school partnership (FSP) intervention targeted these early risk behaviors via improvements in parent-teacher communication and parents' child behavior management strategies. Six years later, 81% of the students completed audio computer-assisted self-interviews. Results lend support to targeting the early antecedent risk behaviors for tobacco smoking.</s><s>To assess the effectiveness of two school based smoking education projects in delaying onset of smoking behaviour and in improving health knowledge, beliefs, and values. Cluster randomised controlled trial of two projects taught under normal classroom conditions. Schools were allocated to one of four groups to receive the family smoking education project (FSE); the smoking and me project (SAM); both projects in sequence (FSE/SAM); or no intervention at all. Self reported smoking behaviour (backed by saliva sample) and change in relevant health knowledge, beliefs, and values. No consistent significant differences in smoking behaviour, health knowledge, beliefs, or values were found between the four groups. More comprehensive interventions than school health education alone will be needed to reduce teenage smoking.</s><s>To evaluate the effect of the middle and junior high school Drug Abuse Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.) The interventions were implemented during 2 school years, when the cohort was in the seventh and eighth grades. Growth curve analytic methods were used to assess changes over time by condition. only in tobacco use and violence; and no significant behavioral differences among girls. curriculum among boys and was more effective than the delayed program controls, underscoring the potential for multiyear, multicomponent prevention programs and demonstrating sex differences in response to intervention programs.</s><s>This paper describes the one-year outcomes of the fourth experimental trial of Project Towards No Drug Abuse. Two theoretical content components of the program were examined to increase our understanding of the relative contribution of each to the effectiveness of the program. Program effectiveness was assessed with both dichotomous and continuous measures of 30-day substance use at baseline and one-year follow-up. Across all program schools, the two different curricula failed to significantly reduce dichotomous measures of substance use (cigarette, alcohol, marijuana, and hard drugs) at one-year follow-up.</s><s>We describe the results of a randomized controlled study on the efficacy of a smoking prevention program based on behavioral methods (Waterloo Smoking Prevention Program 1, adapted). The program was delivered directly by voluntary teachers during school classes. At 36 months the proportion of non-smokers was higher in the intervention group (55% vs 44%; OR (adjusted for clustering) = 1.7; p = .03) and that of regular (at least one cigarette a week) smokers lower (22% vs 39%) than in the control group.</s><s>To evaluate the effectiveness of a school-based smoking prevention and control intervention program among elementary school students. The assessment was carried out through three questionnaires: pre- and post-intervention, 6-month after intervention. After one year intervention, pupils in the intervention group significantly improved their knowledge and attitudes related to tobacco use. The rate of attempting smoking decreased form 7.8% to 2.6% and the rate of passive smoking from 53.6% to 41.8%. The result demonstrated the effectiveness and feasibility of tobacco control in elementary school and the positive effect must be developed.</s><s>Recent evaluations of smoking prevention programs have suggested considerable promise for curricula emphasizing resistance of social influences. The present study extends these evaluations by addressing key methodological limitations in previous work. Twenty-two matched schools were randomized to experimental and control conditions. Grade 6 students received a 6-week core curriculum, plus additional sessions through Grades 7 and 8. Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses examined program impact for five levels of initial smoking experience, ranging from \"never smoker\" through regular, weekly smoker.</s><s>This article reports the results of a 5-year, longitudinal evaluation of the effectiveness of Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE), a school-based primary drug prevention curriculum designed for introduction during the last year of elementary education. DARE is the most widely disseminated school-based prevention curriculum in the United States. Twenty-three elementary schools were randomly assigned to receive DARE and 8 were designated comparison schools. No significant differences were observed between intervention and comparison schools with respect to cigarette, alcohol, or marijuana use during the 7th grade, approximately 1 year after completion of the program, or over the full 5-year measurement interval. The findings of this 5-year prospective study are largely consonant with the results obtained from prior short-term evaluations of the DARE curriculum, which have reported limited effects of the program upon drug use, greater efficacy with respect to attitudes, social skills, and knowledge, but a general tendency for curriculum effects to decay over time.</s><s>This study investigated the effects of a smoking prevention program that emphasized refusal skills training on 1730 adolescents in three high schools and six middle schools. Classes within these schools were randomly assigned to treatment or no-treatment conditions to avoid confounding schools with treatment condition. Across both conditions, subjects who were smoking at pretest and who were at risk to smoke were more likely to be missing at follow-up. The program did have an effect on the refusal skills of participants and the validity of this effect was not jeopardized by differential attrition.</s><s>To assess the effect of an antismoking intervention focusing on adolescents in lower education. Students with lower education smoke more often and perceive more positive norms, and social pressure to smoke, than higher educated students. An intervention based on peer group pressure and social influence may therefore be useful to prevent smoking among these students. 1444 students in the intervention and 1118 students in the control group, all in the first grade, average age 13 years. This leads to an odds ratio of 0.61 (95% CI= 0.41 to 0.90) to uptake smoking in the intervention group compared with the control group. In the short-term, an intervention based on peer pressure decreases the proportion of adolescents with lower education who start smoking.</s><s>This randomized controlled trial evaluated the effectiveness of a multicomponent Health Promoting Schools (HPS) intervention program in improving self-reported smoking outcomes among a cohort of adolescents in 22 public secondary schools in the Hunter Region of New South Wales, Australia. Pre-test surveys were completed by students in the first 2 years of secondary school, with a 2-year post-test survey. Multivariate analyses examined intervention effect for the main outcome, post-test smoking behavior, controlling for pre-test smoking status, school and other confounders. The sample comprised the cohort of 1852 students who completed both surveys. We discuss methodological issues in multicomponent community-based interventions, and highlight the strengths and limitations of this study.</s><s>Few studies have examined the long-term efficacy of computer-based smoking prevention and cessation programs. We analyzed the long-term impact of A Smoking Prevention Interactive Experience (ASPIRE), a theoretically sound computer-based smoking prevention and cessation curriculum for high school students. A total of 1160 students, 1098 of whom were nonsmokers and 62 smokers at baseline, were included. Differences between groups in self-efficacy and resistance skills were not significant. ASPIRE demonstrated the potential for an interactive multimedia program to promote smoking prevention.</s><s>This study evaluated the effects of a school-based intervention on growth trajectories of smoking, drinking, and antisocial behavior among early adolescents. The Going Places Program, included classroom curricula, parent education, and school environment components. The Going Places Program was effective in preventing increases in smoking progression, but its efficacy as a more cross-cutting problem behavior preventive intervention was not confirmed.</s><s>Social-cognitive skill development with sixth graders and its initial impact on substance use.</s><s>No long-term impact has yet been observed with the use of the social-influences approach to school-based smoking prevention for youth. However, whether this lack of impact is due to methodologic problems with the studies or to the failure of the interventions is unclear. Forty Washington school districts were randomly assigned to the intervention or to the control condition. Study participants were children enrolled in two consecutive 3rd grades in the 40 districts (n = 8388); they were followed to 2 years after high school. No significant difference in prevalence of daily smoking was found between students in the control and experimental districts, either at grade 12 (difference [Delta] = 0.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -4.6% to 4.4%, and P =.91 for girls; Delta = 0.3%, 95% CI = -5.0% to 5.5%, and P =.89 for boys) or at 2 years after high school (Delta = -1.4%, 95% CI = -5.0% to 1.6%, and P =.38 for girls; Delta = 2.6%, 95% CI = -2.5% to 7.7%, and P =.30 for boys). Consistent with previous trials, there is no evidence from this trial that a school-based social-influences approach is effective in the long-term deterrence of smoking among youth.</s><s>Experimental evaluation of comprehensive community wide programme to prevent adolescent tobacco use. Eight pairs of small Oregon communities (population 1700 to 13 500) were randomly assigned to receive a school based prevention programme or the school based programme plus a community programme. The prevalence of self reported smoking and smokeless tobacco use in the week before assessment. An effect on the slope of prevalence across time points was evident only when time 2 data points were eliminated from the analysis. There were also significant effects on the slope of alcohol use among ninth graders and the quadratic slope of marijuana for all students.</s><s>The purpose of the study was to determine whether a universal school-based substance abuse prevention program, Take Charge of Your Life (TCYL), prevents or reduces the use of tobacco, alcohol, or marijuana. Eighty-three school clusters (representing school districts) from six metropolitan areas were randomized to treatment (41) or control (42) conditions. Using active consenting procedures, 19,529 seventh graders were enrolled in the 5-year study. Analyses were conducted with data from 17,320 students who completed a baseline survey. Subgroup analyses indicated that the negative effect occurred among nonusers at baseline, and mostly among white students of both genders. Two complementary papers explore the relationship of the targeted program mediators to the use of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana and specifically for students who were substance-free or who used substances at baseline. The finding of a beneficial effect for baseline marijuana users further supports this conclusion.</s><s>A grade five through eight substance abuse prevention program, later incorporated into the Michigan Model for Comprehensive School Health Education, was developed, implemented, and evaluated. Results focus on students who received seven lessons on alcohol in grade six, and eight lessons on tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine in grade seven taught by their regular classroom teachers (after a 6-hour training in the social pressures resistance skills curriculum).</s><s>This paper evaluates a smoking prevention intervention aimed at vocational school students, consisting of an existing Dutch in-school program (three lessons each lasting 50 min) and a computer-based tailored out-of-school program (three tailored letters with smoking prevention messages mailed to students' homes). The remaining 17 schools were randomly assigned to the out-of-school condition or to the control group. Twelve months after the pre-test (post-test 2), the in-school intervention was successful in preventing vocational school students from continuing to smoke, compared with students in the control condition [odds ratio (OR) = 0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.29-0.84]. The effect of the combined approach was not larger than the sum of the effects of the in-school and the out-of-school effects.</s><s>This paper describes the curricula contents, and presents data to evaluate the implementation, process and immediate post-test knowledge of Project Towards No Tobacco Use (Project TNT). Three curricula were designed to counteract the effects of single acquisition variables, whereas a fourth curriculum was designed to counteract the effects of combined social and physical consequences-related influences. These curricula were delivered to seventh grade students by trained project health educators to maximize implementation. This paper documents high levels of implementation in all program conditions. Also, favorable process ratings were obtained across the four program conditions, using multiple measures and sources of ratings (students, health educators and classroom teachers who observed curricula delivery).</s><s>To test the effectiveness of a psychosocial strategy of smoking deterence on seventh grade students, the School Health Education Development project implemented peer-led, teacher-led, and expert-led interventions in six Vermont schools. The peer-led approach reduced the behavioral intention to smoke for both sexes but did not affect current smoking behavior. Both the peer-led and teacher-led interventions had positive, though not significant, effects on student perception of locus of control. In the control schools, females experienced higher levels of smoking onset than males.</s><s>A smoking prevention program was developed to prepare children in elementary school for secondary school. In 2002, 121 schools in The Netherlands were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. The intervention group received 3 lessons in 5th grade of elementary school and a second 3 lessons in 6th grade. Girls showed the largest differences in smoking between intervention and control condition.</s><s>Smoking rates are projected to increase substantially in developing countries such as South Africa. The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of two contrasting approaches to school-based smoking prevention in South African youth compared to the standard health education program. Thirty-six public schools from two South African provinces, KwaZulu-Natal and the Western Cape, were stratified by socioeconomic status and randomized to one of three groups. Group 3 schools (n = 12) received a life skills training curriculum in grades 8 and 9. The primary outcome was past month use of cigarettes based on a self-reported questionnaire. More intensive intervention, in the classroom and beyond, may be needed to further impact smoking behavior.</s><s>A six-year intervention study of the feasibility and effectiveness of a program aimed at the primary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) has been initiated among children in six school districts in Westchester County, New York. Schools randomly were assigned either to the intervention program or to a control group. This paper presents the findings at baseline and at one-year follow-up for the following target risk factors: systolic and diastolic blood pressure, plasma total and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, serum thiocyanate, ponderosity index, triceps skinfold thickness, and postexercise pulse recovery rate. After one year of intervention, the program was found to be acceptable to school administrators, teachers, parents, and children.</s><s>To examine the effectiveness of a drug abuse prevention program in reducing the initiation and escalation of smoking in a sample of predominantly minority junior high school girls. The 15-session prevention program teaches social resistance skills within the context of a broader intervention designed to promote general personal and social competence skills, and is implemented in the seventh grade. Those who participated in the program were less likely to initiate smoking relative to controls, due in part to significant program effects on smoking intentions, smoking knowledge, perceived peer and adult smoking norms, drug refusal skills, and risk taking. A school-based drug abuse prevention approach previously found to be effective among white youth significantly reduced smoking initiation and escalation among urban minority girls.</s><s>The Internet may be an effective medium for delivering smoking prevention to children. Consider This, an Internet-based program, was hypothesized to reduce expectations concerning smoking and smoking prevalence. Group-randomized pretest-posttest controlled trials were conducted in Australia (n = 2,077) and the United States (n = 1,234) in schools containing Grades 6 through 9. Implementation remains the major challenge to delivering interventions via the Internet, both for health educators and researchers.</s><s>The 1985 Minnesota Legislature established guidelines for school-based tobacco-use prevention programming and provided financial incentives to school districts to encourage them to adopt a broad range of preventive measures. The Four Group Comparison Study was a prospective study of 48 school \"units\" which were randomly assigned to one of four conditions in 1987. The Four Group Comparison Study was designed to evaluate the three middle-school interventions that were most widely adopted by Minnesota school districts as a result of the 1985 legislation. The Two State Comparison Study was a serial cross-sectional study of representative districts in Minnesota and Wisconsin. The Two State Comparison Study was designed to determine whether tobacco-use patterns changed in Minnesota relative to Wisconsin following the Minnesota legislation. Together with results from other recent studies, they suggest that even more intensive efforts may be required to effect widespread reductions in adolescent tobacco use.</s><s>found the Project ALERT drug prevention curriculum curbed alcohol misuse and tobacco and marijuana use among eighth-grade adolescents. Comparisons between at-risk girls in ALERT Plus schools (basic curriculum extended to ninth grade with five booster lessons) and at-risk girls in control schools showed the program curbed weekly alcohol and marijuana use, at-risk drinking, alcohol use resulting in negative consequences, and attitudinal and perceptual factors conducive to drug use. Possible reasons for gender differences and implications for prevention programming are discussed.</s><s>Evaluation of a respiratory health education program.</s><s>Effects of a health education program on junior high school students' knowledge, attitudes, and behavior concerning tobacco use.</s><s>A smoking prevention project in six European countries (European Smoking prevention Framework Approach) was developed, featuring activities for adolescents, schools and parents, including out-of-school activities. National diversities required country-specific methods to realize the goals and objectives. Smoking prevalence rates were higher among girls than boys in all countries as far as weekly smoking was concerned. Process evaluations revealed that the project's ambitions were high, but were limited by various constraints including time and delays in receiving funds.</s><s>This paper presents the short-term and long-term results of a randomized smoking prevention trial. Fifty-two schools were randomly assigned to the SI program, the SI(DM) program or a control group. Both programs consisted of five lessons, each lasting 45 min, and were given in weekly sessions in grades 8 and 9 of high schools in the Netherlands. The results suggest that boosters can be an effective tool for maintaining or increasing the effectiveness of smoking prevention programs. It is recommended that the SI program with the booster be implemented at the national level, since this intervention showed the greatest behavioral effects.</s><s>This study examined whether interventions aimed at aggressive/disruptive classroom behavior and poor academic achievement would reduce the incidence of initiation of smoking. Each intervention was directed at 1 of the aforementioned 2 antecedents over first and second grades in 19 urban schools. Targeting early risk antecedents such as aggressive behavior appears to be an important smoking prevention strategy.</s><s>Theory-based smoking prevention programmes in schools may be an effective approach in preventing smoking among Chinese adolescents. The theory-based, multi-level intervention was compared with the standard health curriculum. At the 2-year follow-up (only 7th grade students), similar proportions of baseline non-smokers initiated smoking in the intervention group and the control group (13.5 vs 13.1%), while a possibly lower proportion of baseline experimental smokers escalated to regular smoking in the intervention group than the control group (22.6 vs 40.0%; adjusted OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.12-1.57, P = 0.199). The programme improved adolescents' smoking-related knowledge, but did not change their attitudes towards smoking.</s><s>To evaluate the effects of Project ALERT on adolescents' lifetime and 30-day use of cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana, and inhalants. All public schools in the United States that included grades 6 through 8 and enrolled at least 100 students in sixth grade were recruited. Intervention Project ALERT, a manualized classroom-based substance use prevention curriculum for the middle grades, was taught to sixth and seventh graders. At baseline, students in the intervention condition were slightly to moderately more likely to report use for each of the 8 measures examined than were students in the control condition. For all measures except lifetime use of cigarettes, these differences were less pronounced at follow-up and therefore were in the direction of favorable program effects. Project ALERT was not effective when delivered to the sixth grade population we targeted.</s><s>The aims of this trial, conducted 2004-2008, were to examine (1) the effectiveness of Project Towards No Drug Abuse (TND) at the one-year follow-up when implemented on a large scale; and (2) the relative effectiveness of two training approaches for program implementers. A total of 65 high schools from 14 school districts across the United States were randomized to one of three conditions: regular workshop training, comprehensive implementation support, or standard care control. Physical education and health teachers delivered the program to students (n=2538). Program effectiveness was assessed with dichotomous measures of 30-day substance use at baseline and one-year follow-up.</s><s>A quasi-experimental, longitudinal study was conducted to test the effectiveness over a 1-year period of a cardiovascular risk reduction program for school-age children. The effectiveness of the program was measured with the children's knowledge of physiology of the heart and cardiovascular risk factors, their health habits, and their physical measurements.</s><s>The efficacy of a multicomponent approach to the prevention of cigarette smoking.</s><s>Between 1992 and 1994, an interventional program was held in the secondary schools (\"Hauptschulen\") in Düsseldorf contra cigarette smoking. Half of the schools (intervention schools) were involved in this program which consisted of 15 sessions. During the first year of this program school-teachers and a physician taught students about the function and the abilities of the healthy heart and lung. In addition, the students learned by role-plays how to say no to a cigarette without embarrassment. Also, every student got the opportunity to meet and talk with a famous athlete. Furthermore, smoking-cessation programs were hold in four intervention schools. On the other hand, of the children who started smoking during the program, more girls in the intervention schools quit smoking than in the control schools.</s><s>This study tested the hypothesis that cigarette smoking adoption among adolescents could be suppressed by providing school-based videotape instruction for resisting social influences to smoke. The utilization of same-age peer leaders was also varied to test whether their participation in the classroom would enhance program effects. Seventh grade students (N = 540) from one junior high school in Southern California were randomly assigned by classrooms (N = 15) to: (a) videotape instruction, (b) videotape instruction plus peer leader involvement, or (c) survey-only. Results revealed a marked suppression in the onset of both experimental and regular smoking among those students exposed to the pressure resistance training with peer leader involvement. Data collected on students' use of alcohol and marijuana revealed a generalized suppression effect, albeit weaker than for tobacco, among those students exposed to the social resistance training with peer leader involvement.</s><s>Two strategies for preventing the onset of alcohol abuse, and marijuana and cigarette use were tested in junior high schools in Los Angeles and Orange Counties, California. The second strategy corrected erroneous normative perceptions about prevalence and acceptability of use among peers and established conservative groups norms regarding use. Four experimental conditions were created by randomly assigning schools to receive (a) neither of the experimental curricula (placebo comparison), (b) resistance skill training alone, (c) normative education alone, or (d) both resistance skill training and normative education.</s><s>This paper reports on the evaluation of a culturally grounded prevention intervention targeting substance use among urban middle-school students. The curriculum consists of 10 lessons promoting antidrug norms and teaching resistance and other social skills, reinforced by booster activities and a media campaign. Analyses utilizing a generalized estimating equations approach assessed the overall effectiveness of cultural grounding and the cultural matching hypothesis. Support was found for the intervention's overall effectiveness, with statistically significant effects on gateway drug use as well as norms, attitudes, and resistance strategies but with little support for the cultural matching hypothesis. Specific contrasts found the Mexican American and Multicultural versions impacted the most outcomes.</s><s>The goal of this study was to assess the effects of a school-based smoking prevention programme that used both a video and peer-led discussion groups among Romanian junior high school students aged 13-14 years. The programme embraced the social influence approach and concentrated on enhancing self-efficacy and the acquisition of cigarette refusal skills. Furthermore, the programme had significant effects on smoking-related beliefs. In the experimental group, this resulted in a more negative attitude towards smoking, increased social self-efficacy levels and a more negative intention towards smoking.</s><s>This study assessed the immediate and short-term outcomes of adapting a culturally-grounded middle school program, keepin' it REAL, for elementary school students. The 5th grade kiR curriculum generally appeared no more effective than the control schools' programming in changing students' resistance or decision-making skills; substance use intentions, expectancies, or normative beliefs; or lifetime and recent substance use. Such findings have implications for the age appropriateness of school-based programs.</s><s>Thirty-four schools (n=7426 consented sixth graders, 71% of the eligible population) were randomized to conditions to test the hypothesis that Skills for Adolescence (SFA), a widely used comprehensive life skills training curriculum with a dedicated drug education unit, is more effective than standard care in deterring and delaying substance use through middle school. Two-year posttest (1-year post-intervention) data were collected from 5691 eighth graders (77% of those who completed the sixth-grade survey and 87% of those who completed the seventh-grade survey). There were two significant treatment main effects at the end of the eighth grade: lifetime (P=.05) and recent (P<.03) marijuana use were lower in SFA than control schools with pretest usage and salient demographic and psychosocial variables controlled. There was also one significant Treatment x Pretest Usage interaction around binge drinking.</s><s>The effectiveness of a fifteen session psychosocial smoking prevention strategy was tested on 902 seventh graders from seven junior high schools in suburban New York over 2 years. The prevention program was implemented by regular classroom teachers and consisted of a cognitive component dealing with the immediate consequences of cigarette smoking, a decision-making component, a relaxation-training component, a social skills training component, and a self-improvement component. In addition to testing the overall effectiveness of this approach, the relative efficacy of two different scheduling formats was compared and the extent to which \"booster\" sessions conducted during the year after completion of the program helped to maintain reductions in new smoking was also examined. New regular cigarette smoking was reduced by 87% in the second year for the students in the booster condition.</s><s>This study examined the plausibility of the gateway hypothesis to account for drug involvement in a sample of middle school students participating in a drug abuse, prevention trial. Improvements to social competence reduced multiple drug use at 1- and 2-year follow-ups. Specific program effects disrupted drug progression by decreasing alcohol and cigarette use over 1 year and reducing cigarette use over a 2-year period. Controlling for previous drug use, alcohol was integrally involved in the progression to multiple drug use.</s><s>Students (N = 4,466) attending 56 schools in New York State were involved in a 3-year study testing the effectiveness of a cognitive-behavioral approach to substance abuse prevention. Significant prevention effects were found for cigarette smoking, marijuana use, and immoderate alcohol use.</s><s>We reviewed these problems and the explanations for them and described a bicultural competence skills approach for preventing substance abuse with American-Indian adolescents. Data from a study of that approach suggest its efficacy with American-Indian youth.</s><s>Schools in many countries undertake programmes for smoking prevention, but systematic reviews have shown mixed evidence of their effectiveness. We undertook a cluster randomised controlled trial of 10 730 students aged 12-13 years in 59 schools in England and Wales. The intervention (ASSIST [A Stop Smoking In Schools Trial] programme) consisted of training influential students to act as peer supporters during informal interactions outside the classroom to encourage their peers not to smoke. The odds ratio of being a smoker in intervention compared with control schools was 0.75 (95% CI 0.55-1.01) immediately after the intervention (n=9349 students), 0.77 (0.59-0.99) at 1-year follow-up (n=9147), and 0.85 (0.72-1.01) at 2-year follow-up (n=8756). The results suggest that, if implemented on a population basis, the ASSIST intervention could lead to a reduction in adolescent smoking prevalence of public-health importance.</s><s>To evaluate the effectiveness of the school-based drug abuse prevention program developed in the EU-Dap study (EUropean Drug Abuse Prevention trial) in preventing the use of tobacco, alcohol and drugs at the post-test. Seven European countries participated in the study; 170 schools (7079 pupils 12-14 years of age) were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions or to a control condition during the school year 2004/2005. The program consisted in 12-hour class-based curriculum based on a comprehensive social-influence approach. A post-test survey was carried out in all participating schools, 3 months after the end of the program.</s><s>This study evaluates the effects of a school-based smoking prevention program after 1 year, using school (22 middle/elementary schools, 15 high schools) as both the unit of randomization and the unit of analysis. Teacher survey data indicated that treatment schools had a median of 10 classroom sessions devoted to tobacco/drug use education, 5 of which were the sessions designed for this evaluation, and control schools had also dedicated a median of 10 classroom sessions to tobacco/drug education. Thus, the study evaluated the incremental effects of the social influence intervention compared to \"standard-care\" curricula. Among those who reported smoking one or more cigarettes in the month prior to the intervention, there was a significant treatment effect on rate of smoking at one year, but no grade level, gender, or interaction effects. The analyses for nonsmokers, however, showed no significant effects, and the program did not affect self-reported alcohol or marijuana use.</s><s>Culturally specific smoking prevention programs are needed for Chinese adolescents. As a randomized trial, the intervention was implemented in 1998 with 7th grade students in seven schools with seven matched control schools. The odds of baseline nonsmokers initiating smoking did not differ between the program and control groups (OR=1.08 with 95% CI=0.71, 1.64). Among boys who were recent smokers at baseline, the prevention program significantly reduced risk of remaining recent smokers at follow-up (OR=0.45 with 95% CI=0.23, 0.88). This social normative smoking prevention curriculum did not demonstrate a significant primary prevention effect but showed potential for secondary prevention.</s><s>A school-based environmental program to reduce adolescent smoking was conducted in 20 schools (10 intervention; 10 control) in south central Louisiana. The 9th grade cohort (n = 4,763; mean age = 15.4 yrs; 51% female; 61% Caucasian; 30-day smoking prevalence at baseline = 25%) was followed over four years for 30-day smoking prevalence with the school as the unit of analysis. The higher the percentage of white students in a school the higher the prevalence rates regardless of intervention/control status.</s><s>In most countries the school has been the common setting for antismoking education. In general, such programmes have been shown to be less effective than one might expect, and much remains to be learned about the types of educational experiences that are effective in preventing adolescents from becoming habitual smokers.</s><s>The Child and Adolescent Trial for Cardiovascular Health (CATCH) is a multistate field trial examining the effects of school environment, classroom curricula, and family intervention components in promoting the cardiovascular health of elementary school students. In this study, changes in school tobacco use policies and smoking experimentation among students were assessed. A total of 6,527 subjects in 96 schools in California, Louisiana, Minnesota, and Texas answered questions about behaviors and potential correlates of smoking as part of the CATCH health behavior questionnaire in Spring 1994. The degree to which such policy was implemented was measured using surveys of school officials. School intervention condition was not a factor in the prediction of experimentation. Minnesota and Texas, with stronger state laws supporting local policy, had nearly completely smoke-free schools. Louisiana, which allows local decision making regarding smoking policy, had the most difficulty establishing a policy for all districts. Future studies should examine the impact of parallel policy interventions that are ongoing at both school and state levels. Tobacco-free policies appear to be a crucial part of school-based interventions and must be tailored to political and regional factors affecting a given school district.</s><s>Project DARE (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) is the most prevalent school-based drug-use prevention program in the United States, but there is little evidence of its effectiveness. Results from a longitudinal evaluation of the program in 36 schools in Illinois provide only limited support for DARE's impact on student's drug use immediately following the intervention, and no support for either continued or emerging impact on drug use 1 or 2 years after receiving DARE instruction. In addition, DARE had only limited positive effects on psychological variables (i.e., self-esteem) and no effect on social variables (e.g., peer resistance skills).</s><s>Since 1974 an anti-smoking campaign consisting of a one-day educational intervention has been carried out in primary schools in Milan by the Italian League against Cancer (Milan Division). Four years later a self-administered questionnaire was distributed in order to investigate the children's smoking habits. The proportion of smokers was 8.05% and 8.72% (p = 0.23) respectively for the intervention and control groups.</s><s>Psychosocial tobacco use prevention programs are based on the assumption that refusal skills training will have a suppressive effect on the onset of use by enabling non-using adolescents to refuse offers of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. Results showed that the comprehensive prevention program produced a favorable trend in delaying or preventing the onset of tobacco use. Moreover, refusal skill quality was not related to overall tobacco use or cigarette use at any grade.</s><s>To examine whether a year long programme based on the transtheoretical model of behaviour change, incorporating three sessions using an expert system computer program and three class lessons, could reduce the prevalence of teenage smoking.

All students were given a pretest, posttest and three-month follow-up which assessed smoking behavior as well as knowledge and personality variables.</s><s>To test whether a social network tailored substance abuse prevention program can reduce substance use among high-risk adolescents without creating deviancy training (iatrogenic effects). Students with classroom friends who use substances were more likely to increase their use. A peer-led interactive substance abuse prevention program can accelerate peer influences. For students with a peer environment that supports non-use, the program was effective and reduced substance use.</s><s>A pilot project for the prevention of substance abuse in schools (PASE) has been developed in 1988-90 in sixth and seventh grades (12-14 years-old) in 11 primary schools in the city of Barcelona (Spain). These results are presented, comparing the evolution of attitudes, beliefs and behavior of these school children with a control group composed of students from reference schools.</s><s>A five-year intervention study of the effectiveness of the \"Know Your Body\" program in reducing coronary heart disease risk factors among black students in the District of Columbia, who were in grades 4-6 at baseline, was begun in 1983. Nine schools were stratified on socioeconomic status and randomly assigned to control and intervention groups. The \"Know Your Body\" curriculum focuses on nutrition, fitness, and the prevention of cigarette smoking. After two years of intervention, results indicated that the program may have had a favorable impact on the following risk factors: systolic and diastolic pressures, HDL cholesterol, ratio of total to HDL cholesterol, fitness (postexercise pulse recovery rate), and smoking. Significant net changes in the favorable direction also were found for health knowledge and attitude toward smoking.</s><s>Preventing tobacco use in youths may be an easier task than helping adults break the habit of smoking and overcome its ill effects.</s><s>Project Northland is an efficacy trial with the goal of preventing or reducing alcohol use among young adolescents by using a multilevel, communitywide approach. Conducted in 24 school districts and adjacent communities in northeastern Minnesota since 1991, the intervention targets the class of 1998 (sixth-grade students in 1991) and has been implemented for 3 school years (1991 to 1994). The differences were particularly notable among those who were nonusers at baseline. The results of Project Northland suggest that multilevel, targeted prevention programs for young adolescents are effective in reducing alcohol use.</s><s>This study determined the effect of provider (nurse or teacher) and training method (workshop or self-preparation) on outcomes of a social influences smoking prevention program. There were no significant differences in outcome as a function of training method and no significant differences in outcome between teacher-provided and nurse-provided interventions in high- and medium-risk schools. Although nurses achieved better outcomes than did teachers in low-risk schools, neither provider type achieved outcomes superior to the control condition in those schools.</s><s>The main objective of this study was to determine if a program emphasizing training for coping with the social pressures to smoke cigarettes is effective in preventing initial experimentation in the same population. After a baseline survey students were randomly assigned to an intervention and a control group. Although designed as a prevention tool, the program also had a therapeutic effect. The proportion of subjects in the intervention group that quit smoking was significantly higher than that of the control group (72% vs 34.78%; p < 0.01).</s><s>This article describes a set of studies which compare the effectiveness of innovative interventions led by older peers and which included a parent component with teacher-led interventions for nutrition, blood pressure, and smoking prevention. Results of the parent-child survey showed reasonable agreement between parents and children for reports of the child's exercise, dieting, and fast food consumption, but poorer agreement for smoking and perceptions of family interaction.</s><s>Achieving significant reductions in tobacco use by youth is an important challenge. There is a pressing need to develop and evaluate innovative strategies that stimulate youth involvement and are effective in multi-ethnic populations. The aim of Project SPLASH is to evaluate the impact of a school-based smoking prevention intervention that emphasizes active involvement of middle school students, on rates of smoking initiation and regular smoking in a multi-ethnic cohort of youth in Hawaii. Approximately 1 in 4 students had tried smoking and 30-day smoking prevalence at baseline was 8%. The intervention was well implemented by teachers across both the intervention and control school classes. The intervention study has the potential to elucidate how youth respond to an intervention with student involvement that incorporates cognitive and social action components.</s><s>This study evaluated the efficacy of a version of Project EX that was adapted for implementation in the classroom context (Project EX-4). This paper reports the program outcomes based on pretest, six-month, and one-year follow-up surveys. The net change varied between -5.1% and -7.6%, comparing the program condition to the control condition. The implementation of Project EX in a classroom setting produced decreases in smoking among students in the program, relative to those in the standard care control condition.</s><s>Project SUCCESS is a selective and indicated substance use prevention program that targets high risk students in secondary school settings. Two successive cohorts of alternative high schools were randomly assigned to an intervention or control group, yielding seven schools per condition. Main outcomes included 30-day use of alcohol, marijuana, and illegal drugs excluding marijuana, and drinking to intoxication. It is possible that Project SUCCESS would perform better in schools with higher and more regular rates of attendance.</s><s>We evaluated the revised Project ALERT drug prevention program across a wide variety of Midwestern schools and communities. Fifty-five South Dakota middle schools were randomly assigned to program or control conditions. Treatment group students received 11 lessons in 7th grade and 3 more in 8th grade.</s><s>This study examines the effectiveness of the school-based campaign \"Smoke-Free Class Competition\" as a means of preventing young non-smokers from taking up smoking. In order to evaluate the effects of the intervention, we compared the smoking behavior in the intervention and the control group at two points in time, shortly before, and 18 months after the intervention, on an individual case basis. (1) Stabilization of never-smoking rates: the proportion of pupils remaining a never-smoker at the follow-up is 62.1% in the intervention group and 61.5% in the control group (OR 1.02, 95% CI: 0.83-1.24); (2) Lowering of relapse rates among ex-smokers: the proportion of former smokers who had not started smoking again in the follow-up is 45.1% in the intervention group and 41.4% in the control group (OR 1.07, 95% CI: 0.77-1.49).</s><s>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a school health intervention program using life skills training (LST) to reduce tobacco and drug use among Thai high school students. The students in the control group received the tobacco and drug education curriculum normally provided; the intervention group received a LST program that provided information and skills specifically related to drug and tobacco use. The results showed that a LST program was effective for preventing tobacco and drug use in Thai high school students.</s><s>Data from a 2-year study describe tobacco use trends, perceptions, and prevention effects for 1,281 5th and 6th graders enrolled in 12 randomly selected Washington State elementary schools. Youths were pretested, then randomly divided by school into skills, discussion, and control groups. Youths in the skills group also learned communication and problem-solving methods for handling difficult situations around tobacco use. Following intervention, youths were posttested, then retested semiannually for 2 years. During the 2-year study, three-quarters of all smokers and nonusers and half of all smokeless tobacco users maintained their statuses. These findings demonstrate the potential of skills intervention methods for lowering tobacco use rates among adolescents.</s><s>This study examined the long-term substance use outcomes of 2 brief interventions designed for general population families of young adolescents. Pretest data were collected in the 6th grade and the reported follow-up data were collected in the 10th grade. Significant intervention-control differences in initiation and current use were found for both interventions. It is concluded that brief family skills-training interventions designed for general populations have the potential to reduce adolescent substance use and thus have important public health implications.</s><s>Skills intervention to prevent cigarette smoking was evaluated with 689 adolescents.</s><s>This study evaluated cigarette smoking prevention methods with a sample of adolescent females and males. Smoking rates at posttest and at both follow-ups were lower in the skills-building group than in the other three groups. The study's strengths and limits are discussed along with directions for future smoking prevention research.</s><s>Thirty schools in New Delhi, India, were randomly assigned to 3 conditions: school-based and family-based intervention, school-based intervention only, or control group. Intervention students were significantly less likely than controls to have been offered, received, experimented with, or have intentions to use tobacco.</s><s>Two drug abuse prevention curricula were tested to determine their efficacy in preventing the onset of tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana use among adolescents. The first program focused on prevention through social pressure resistance training. Post-test analyses indicated that the social program delivered to seventh grade subjects was effective in delaying the onset of tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana use.</s><s>This study developed and tested skills- and community-based approaches to prevent substance abuse among Native American youth. Following intervention delivery, youths in all arms completed posttest measurements and three annual follow-up measurements. Youths in schools assigned to the intervention arms learned cognitive and behavioral skills for substance abuse prevention. One intervention arm additionally engaged local community residents in efforts to prevent substance use among Native American youth. Over the course of the 3.5-year study, increased rates of tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana use were reported by youths across the three arms of the study. Community intervention components appeared to exert no added beneficial influence on youths' substance use, beyond the impact of skills intervention components alone.</s><s>Much research has been done in developing and implementing smoking prevention programs; however, few studies have focused on urban Black populations. In November of 1989, a comprehensive prevention program was implemented to decrease the incidence of new smokers within the adolescent population in a Black community. The program combined a school-based curriculum with a comprehensive media intervention. All components of the program were financed by business leaders from the targeted community.</s><s>The primary purpose of this study was to test the efficacy of a brief, multi-health behavior intervention integrating physical activity and alcohol use prevention messages for high school-aged adolescents. A total of 604 participants, 335 9th and 269 11th grade students from a suburban high school in northeast Florida participated in this study. Differences between intervention groups were evaluated with a series of MANCOVA tests. A post hoc analysis examining interactions between past 30-day use of marijuana and/or cigarettes by treatment group indicates significant positive effects for drug using adolescents who received Project SPORT on alcohol consumption, drug use behaviors, and drug use initiation at 3-months, and for drug use behaviors and exercise habits at 12-months (p's < 0.05).</s><s>A smoking prevention program for adolescents conducted in two public middle schools focused on resisting peer pressure to smoke and understanding the intent of commercial cigarette advertising. One class in each school participated in the program group and one served as a control group. The program consisted of eight sessions and was conducted by first-year medical students. Data on smoking behavior and related information were obtained from self-administered questionnaires at baseline, at the conclusion of the program, and one year later.</s><s>To evaluate the impact of a classroom-based, Web-assisted tobacco intervention addressing smoking prevention and cessation with adolescents. Participants were randomly assigned to a tailored Web-assisted tobacco intervention or an interactive control condition task conducted during a single classroom session with e-mail follow-up. The cornerstone of the intervention was a five-stage interactive Web site called the Smoking Zine (http://www.smokingzine.org) integrated into a program that included a paper-based journal, a small group form of motivational interviewing, and tailored e-mails. Multilevel logistic growth modeling was used to assess the effect of the intervention on change over time. The integrated Smoking Zine program helped smokers significantly reduce the likelihood of having high intentions to smoke and increased their likelihood of high resistance to continued cigarette use at 6 months. By providing an accessible and attractive method of engaging young people in smoking prevention and cessation, this interactive and integrated program provides a novel vehicle for school- and population-level health promotion.</s><s>This study investigated the efficacy of a social-influences tobacco prevention program conducted with adolescents living in a high tobacco production area. Students in 10 experimental schools completed the tobacco prevention program and a booster intervention.</s><s>In autumn 1995 The Norwegian Cancer Society in cooperation with The Research Center for Health Promotion, University of Bergen started a study of school-based interventions aiming at preventing smoking among pupils in Norwegian secondary schools. The study comprised a nationwide sample of 4441 students at 99 schools (195 classes). This panel of students is followed through annual data collections till they graduate in spring 1997. Baseline data were collected by questionnaires administered in class in November 1994 and the first follow-up survey was carried out in May 1995. Effects of the most extensive program among subgroups of students were examined by comparing Groups A and B. The effect of the program on recruitment of smokers seems to have been at least as strong or even stronger among 'high-risk' students than among other students.</s><s>This study used Complier Average Causal Effect analysis (CACE; see G. Imbens & D. Rubin, 1997) to examine the impact of an adaptive approach to family intervention in the public schools on rates of substance use and antisocial behavior among students ages 11-17. All services were voluntary, and approximately 25% of the families engaged in the selected and indicated levels.</s><s>This study evaluated the substance initiation effects of an intervention combining family and school-based competency-training intervention components. Relative reduction rates for alcohol initiation were 30.0% for the combined intervention and 4.1% for LST only.</s><s>The distal impact of a school based universal preventive intervention targeting disruptive behavior problems on tobacco and alcohol use from age 10 to 13 years was explored. Second grade classrooms (children aged 7 years) were randomly assigned to the intervention or a control condition. Tobacco and alcohol use from age 10 to 13 years was available for 477 children (72% of original sample). The impact of intervention on the initial level and growth in probability of substance use was explored. The results underscore the importance of the early prevention of disruptive behavior problems substance use initiation.</s><s>The issue of prevention of tobacco use has received a great deal of attention in recent years. We discuss the preliminary results of a prospective cohort evaluation of the PAL program. It is clear that prevention programming will have to consider targeting males and females in different ways.</s><s>1956 7th grade students of high schools and secondary modern schools in three cities with 110,000 to 180,000 inhabitants were asked about cigarette, alcohol and drug consumption using questionnaires. Subsequently 1080 of the students took part in a newly invented non-smoking curriculum which was held during 8 lessons within 4 weeks (intervention group (I)). The lessons were performed by non-smoking physicians who had passed a training programme before. The number of students who started smoking within the two years was significantly lower in the intervention group. First-time consumers of drugs like cannabis, marihuana and organic solvents were found less often in the intervention group among boys in high schools than in the control group (I: 14.9%; K: 23.6%; p < 0.05).</s><s>To determine the impact of a school-based harm minimization smoking intervention compared to traditional abstinence-based approaches. Over 4000 students were recruited to participate and schools were assigned randomly to either the harm minimization intervention or a standard abstinence-based programme. Comparison schools implemented standard abstinence-based programmes and policies. The school-based adolescent harm minimization intervention appears to have been more effective than the abstinence-based social influences programme at reducing regular smoking.</s><s>A five-year intervention study of the feasibility and effectiveness of a program aimed at the primary prevention of chronic disease was initiated in 1980 among children in 22 elementary schools in the Bronx, New York. Schools randomly were assigned either to the intervention program or to a control group. Subjects were eligible at baseline and at one-year follow-up for participation in a medical examination in which the following target risk factors were measured: systolic and diastolic blood pressures, plasma total and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, serum thiocyanate, ponderosity index, triceps skinfold thickness, and postexercise pulse recovery rate. After one year of intervention, systolic pressure increased less in the intervention group than among controls. Total cholesterol decreased in the intervention group while increasing among controls.</s><s>A major challenge in the dissemination of evidence-based family interventions (EBFIs) designed to reduce youth substance use and other problem behaviors is effective and sustainable community-based recruitment. This understudied topic is addressed by a preliminary study of 14 community-university partnership teams randomly assigned to an intervention condition in which teams attempted sustained implementation of EBFIs with two cohorts of middle school families. Community team functioning (e.g., production of quality team promotional materials) and technical assistance (TA) variables (e.g., effective collaboration with TA, frequency of TA requests) were associated with higher recruitment rates, even after controlling for community and school district contextual influences. Results support the community-university partnership model for recruitment that was implemented in the study.</s><s>We assessed the effectiveness of a 2-year multicomponent, school-based intervention designed to reduce tobacco use rates among adolescents in an urban area of India. Students from 32 schools in Delhi and Chennai, India, were recruited and randomly assigned to an intervention or control group. The intervention consisted of behavioral classroom curricula, school posters, a parental involvement component, and peer-led activism. Findings showed that students in the intervention group were significantly less likely than were students in the control group to exhibit increases in cigarette smoking or bidi smoking over the 2-year study period.</s><s>In a randomized controlled trial, we evaluated the effect on tobacco use onset among middle school students of Family Communications (FC) activities designed to mobilize parental influences against tobacco use and Youth Anti-tobacco Activities (YAT) designed to market anti-tobacco norms to adolescents. State, county, and local prevention coordinators around Oregon served as liaisons to schools. To generate interest, staff made presentations to these groups and distributed marketing packets at several conferences. Additionally, we created an intervention manual so that other communities could replicate this study.</s><s>The objective of the present study was to study the ability to influence young at-risk patients' attitudes toward tobacco use through two intervention methods that were performed by dental health professionals. Two interventions, a brief individual motivational interview and an adapted school lecture, were studied, and both were compared with a control group. Patients born in 1989 and 1992 who were judged by the dental personnel as potentially at risk for dental diseases, a total of 301 individuals, were included. Important factors that kept the participants away from tobacco use were the harmful effects and the approaches of parents and friends. No change in tobacco use was registered after intervention, although the participants reported an increased use among friends.</s><s>This study presents one-year follow-up data from an evaluation study testing the effectiveness of a cognitive-behavioral substance abuse prevention approach which emphasizes the teaching of social resistance skills within the larger context of an intervention designed to enhance general social and personal competence. The follow-up study involved 998 eighth graders from 10 suburban New York junior high schools. Similar effects are evident for females when the prevention program is implemented with fidelity by classroom teachers.</s><s>Understanding the developmental pathways and sex differences in cigarette smoking behaviors in adolescents has the potential to positively impact substance abuse prevention and to reduce smoking-related health problems. Growth mixture modeling was used to examine different trajectories in cigarette smoking behaviors among male and female students (N=1874 6th graders; 50.4% male, mean age 11.8 years at baseline) participating in the Unplugged school-based randomized control trial for substance use prevention. A two-class model characterized cigarette use as a function of sex and Unplugged intervention status. More rapid cigarette use increases were observed in females (OR=1.17, p=0.01 in both rapid/moderate and slow smoking escalator classes) as compared to males. This study adds to a growing literature on developmental and sex differences in cigarette use among adolescents.</s>"

Bone turnover was assessed by measurement of serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, and fasting urinary calcium/creatinine ratios. No significant change in these parameters were evident in the etidronate group.</s><s>We observed the effects on bone metabolism of the addition of different doses of oral norethisterone during treatment with the GnRH agonist nafarelin (Synarel, Syntex). Thirty-one patients (33%) left the study prematurely and three patients were non-compliant with the study drug. By 6 months significant increases in urinary calcium/creatinine ratio were seen, compared to baseline, in the nafareline and placebo (P = 0.001, n = 14), 0.7 mg (P = 0.04, n = 13) and 1.4 mg norethisterone groups (P = 0.009, n = 17) but not in the nafarelin or 2.45 mg norethisterone groups (P = 0.72, n = 16). Six months after stopping nafarelin, with or without norethisterone, bone mass was not different from baseline.</s><s>To evaluate bone biochemical markers as predictors of the efficacy of a hormone replacement therapy (HRT), we studied the bone changes induced by the cessation and return of ovarian function in 28 patients treated for 6 months with a GnRH agonist. This model reproduced the effects observed in postmenopausal women with high bone turnover treated with HRT. At the end of the treatment, Z scores were 1.8 +/- 0.3 for Crosslaps (CTx) and deoxypyridinoline (D-Pyr), and 1.1 +/- 0.2 for bone alkaline phosphatase (B-ALP) and osteocalcin (OC). 34 +/- 2.24 and -1.73 +/- 3.25% at the lumbar spine and the femoral neck, respectively. We conclude that measuring individual biochemical bone markers can help to predict the bone effect of an increase in the circulating estradiol in women with ovarian deficiency.</s><s>Treatment of endometriosis with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) is limited to 6 months because of possible adverse effects on bone metabolism. We designed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, prospective study of 27 patients with endometriosis who were given GnRHa with or without hormone add-back therapy (+ 20 microg of ethinyl estradiol with 0.15 mg desogestrel) designed to suppress the adverse effects of hypoestrogenism while preserving the efficacy of GnRHa. Both regimens showed significant improvements in endometriosis, dysmenorrhea, and pelvic pain; effects were significantly better in the GnRHa + placebo group. Urinary levels of pyridinium crosslinks increased significantly in the GnRHa + placebo group, and declined to normal in the GnRHa + add-back group.</s><s>The effects of a GnRH agonist and danazol on bone mineral content (BMC) in Japanese women with endometriosis were investigated. Trabecular BMC of the 3rd lumbar vertebra was measured using quantitative computerized tomography before treatment, at the end of treatment and 6 months after treatment by the same radiologist who was not informed about the drug used. Serum estradiol and the biochemical parameters of bone metabolism were also measured. Because treatment with buserelin, but not with danazol, was always associated with a significant decrease in BMC at L3, repeated usage of buserelin may lead to cumulative bone loss in patients with endometriosis.</s><s>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of vitamin K2 and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] in preventing bone loss induced by estrogen deficiency during therapy with the GnRH agonist (GnRH-a) leuprolide. Bone formation and resorption markers were also measured before and after 6 months of treatment. There were no significant differences in the background parameters among the four groups. Bone mineral density was reduced in all four groups, but the percent changes varied slightly, at - 5.25% (group A), -3.72% (P < 0.05 vs. group A) (group B), -4.13% (group C), and -3.59% (P < 0.01 vs. group A) (group D), respectively.

Mean (SD) deep dyspareunia scores according to a 0-3 point verbal rating scale decreased from 1.8 (0.9) at baseline to 1.3 (0.7) at the end of treatment in the 3-monthly depot group and from 2.1 (1.2) to 1.3 (0.7) in the monthly depot group. The monthly depot caused a slightly more marked inhibition of serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels with respect to the 3-monthly preparation. Mean (SD) endometriosis scores at baseline and at 6-month follow-up laparoscopy were respectively 32.8 (25.1) and 12.2 (9.3) in the 3-monthly depot group and 29.0 (22.7) and 13.1 (15.3) in the monthly depot group (paired t-test, P < 0.05).</s><s>Nafarelin: a new medical therapy for endometriosis.</s><s>To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a GnRH agonist, leuprolide acetate depot, alone and in combination with three hormonal add-back regimens in the management of endometriosis-associated pelvic pain.

Fifty premenopausal women with laparoscopically diagnosed endometriosis (revised American Fertility Score for endometriosis implants equal to four or greater) and significant symptoms of dysmenorrhoea, dyspareunia, and other pelvic pain. There was a significant reduction in the extent of pelvic endometriosis in both groups, with no difference between the groups. Both groups experienced an improvement in symptoms and signs, again with no difference between groups.</s><s>Single and dual-energy quantitative computed tomography (QCT) were used to measure spinal trabecular bone mineral content in 24 women treated with either nafarelin (15 patients) or danazol (nine patients) for endometriosis. This loss was reversible with no significant difference in the bone mineral measurement made before treatment and that made at 6 months after treatment was stopped (difference -1.95 g/l, NS). A small but statistically significant (+2.2 g/l, P less than 0.05) increase in bone mineral was measured in the group of patients treated with danazol for 6 months. The dual-energy QCT gave similar results, indicating little change in trabecular fat content.</s><s>Before treatment, the trabecular bone mineral content of the lumbar spine and femoral neck was not significantly different between endometriosis patients and age-matched controls (N = 26). In 17 subjects treated with a monthly goserelin implant, serum estradiol (E2) levels were suppressed into the menopausal range. Normal menses returned within 2 months after cessation of either medication. Six months after goserelin treatment, the lumbar spine and femoral neck bone mineral content was still reduced but to values not significantly different from the pre-treatment and control values; urinary calcium-creatinine ratio was decreased, whereas serum alkaline phosphatase was still elevated.

Among patients with idiopathic venous thromboembolism, 11 of 90 patients assigned to extended anticoagulation and 11 of 91 patients assigned to discontinue treatment experienced a recurrence (relative risk, 0.99 [CI, 0.45 to 2.16]).</s><s>In patients with idiopathic deep venous thrombosis, continuing anticoagulant therapy beyond three months is associated with a reduced incidence of recurrent thrombosis during the period of therapy. Whether this benefit persists after anticoagulant therapy is discontinued is controversial. The primary study outcome was recurrence of symptomatic, objectively confirmed venous thromboembolism during at least two years of follow-up. The primary intention-to-treat analysis showed that of 134 patients assigned to continued oral anticoagulant therapy, 21 had a recurrence of venous thromboembolism (15.7 percent; average follow-up, 37.8 months), as compared with 21 of 133 patients assigned to the discontinuation of oral anticoagulant therapy (15.8 percent; average follow-up, 37.2 months), resulting in a relative risk of 0.99 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.57 to 1.73). In patients with idiopathic deep venous thrombosis, the clinical benefit associated with extending the duration of anticoagulant therapy to one year is not maintained after the therapy is discontinued.</s><s>The optimal duration of oral anticoagulant therapy after a first episode of venous thromboembolism remains controversial. The outcome events were recurrences and major, minor, or fatal bleeding complications. There were 23 recurrences of venous thromboembolism in the short treatment group (6.4%) and 26 in the long treatment group (7.4%); the 2 treatment regimens had an equivalent effect. For patients with temporary risk factors who have a low risk of recurrence, 3 months of treatment seems to be sufficient.</s><s>The risk of recurrence is lower after treatment of an episode of venous thromboembolism associated with a transient risk factor, such as recent surgery, than after an episode associated with a permanent, or no, risk factor. Our goal was to determine if the duration of treatment could be reduced without increasing the rate of recurrent venous thromboembolism during 11 months of follow-up. The incidence of recurrent venous thromboembolism after discontinuation of warfarin was 6.8% per patient-year in those who received warfarin for 1 month and 3.2% per patient-year in those who received warfarin for 3 months (rate difference of 3.6% per patient-year; 95% CI - 3.8, 11.0). Duration of anticoagulant therapy for venous thromboembolism provoked by a transient risk factor should not be reduced from 3 months to 1 month as this is likely to increase recurrent venous thromboembolism without achieving a clinically important decrease in bleeding.</s><s>The optimal duration of oral anticoagulant therapy after a first episode of venous thromboembolism is still a matter of debate. We performed a multicenter trial comparing six weeks of oral anticoagulant treatment with six months of such therapy in patients who had a first episode of venous thromboembolism. There was no difference in mortality or the rate of major hemorrhage between the six-week and six-month groups. Six months of prophylactic oral anticoagulation after a first episode of venous thromboembolism led to a lower recurrence rate than did treatment lasting for six weeks. The difference between the two groups occurred between 6 weeks and 6 months after the start of treatment, and the rates of recurrence remained nearly parallel for 1 1/2 years thereafter.</s><s>A consensus has not been reached about the optimal duration of oral anticoagulant therapy after a second episode of venous thromboembolism. The initial episodes of deep-vein thrombosis (n = 193) and pulmonary embolism (n = 34), as well as recurrent episodes, were all objectively confirmed. After four years of follow-up, there were 26 recurrences of venous thromboembolism that fulfilled the diagnostic criteria, 23 in the group assigned to six months of therapy (20.7 percent) and 3 in the group assigned to continuing therapy (2.6 percent). The relative risk of major hemorrhage in the six-month group, as compared with the infinite-treatment group was 0.3 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.1 to 1.1). Prophylactic oral anticoagulation that was continued for an indefinite period after a second episode of venous thromboembolism was associated with a much lower rate of recurrence during four years of follow-up than treatment for six months.</s><s>Patients who have a first episode of venous thromboembolism in the absence of known risk factors for thrombosis (idiopathic thrombosis) are often treated with anticoagulant therapy for three months. Such patients may benefit from longer treatment, however, because they appear to have an increased risk of recurrence after anticoagulant therapy is stopped. A prespecified interim analysis of efficacy led to the early termination of the trial after 162 patients had been enrolled and followed for an average of 10 months. Warfarin resulted in a 95 percent reduction in the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (95 percent confidence interval, 63 to 99 percent).</s>"

Of the 97 patients receiving melphalan plus hexamethylmelamine, 28% achieved complete response compared with 32% of 72 patients given Adriamycin plus cyclophosphamide. The partial response rates for the combinations were 24% and 17%, respectively. After statistically adjusting for distribution of cell type and grade, the clinical complete response rate for Adriamycin and cyclophosphamide (32%) in measurable cases was significantly higher (P = 0.04) than for melphalan alone. However, this combination did not improve median survival (12.3, 13.5, and 14.2 months, respectively, for M, M + H, and A + C).</s><s>Between March 1985 and January 1987, 103 women with histologically proven stage III-IV ovarian carcinoma were randomly allocated to groups receiving monthly intravenous regimens of 1 g of cyclophosphamide/m2 plus either 60 mg of cisplatin (CDDP)/m2 or 150 mg of carboplatin (CBDCA)/m2 for 1 year unless disease progressed earlier. Those 24 patients still receiving CBDCA were encouraged to cross over to the CDDP-based regimen and 21 of them did. Following treatment crossover, the relative risk of death associated with original allocation to CBDCA receded from 1.79 to 0.97, indicating success of the salvage treatment using the CDDP-based regimen. If CDDP is to be supplanted by CBDCA, larger, more myelosuppressive doses of CBDCA will be required.</s><s>A phase III study of carboplatin vs cisplatin in CAP regimen for ovarian cancer was conducted by a cooperative study group consisting of 22 institutions nationwide. No significant difference was observed between these two regimens in response rates, and no significant differences were noted between the two regimens in each of the clinical toxicities and abnormalities in laboratory findings. Since the carboplatin regimen group did not require hydration, or the use diuretics or antiemetics, these results suggested that carboplatin is more useful in the treatment of ovarian cancer than cisplatin.</s><s>Between 1974 and 1982, 273 patients with epithelial cancer of the ovary (International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics Stages III and IV) were randomized in four therapeutic trials. The superiority of Adriamycin plus cisplatin in producing the best response rate led to its use as the reference arm in subsequent trials. Eligibility for second look required complete clinical remission and completion of at least 10 cycles of chemotherapy. To date, 73 second-look operations have been performed on randomized patients.</s><s>To compare cisplatin-cyclophosphamide versus carboplatin-cyclophosphamide as primary chemotherapy for stage III (suboptimal) and stage IV ovarian cancer. The estimated median survivals were 17.4 and 20.0 months for the cisplatin and carboplatin study arms, respectively. There was less thrombocytopenia on the cisplatin arm (P less than .001); however, there was less nausea and emesis (P less than or equal to .001 for courses 1 to 5), renal toxicity (P less than .001), anemia (P = .01), hearing loss (P less than .001), tinnitus (P = .01), neuromuscular toxicities (P = .001), and alopecia (P less than .001) on the carboplatin arm.</s><s>Controlled prospective trial of combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, and 5-fluorouracil for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer: a preliminary report.</s><s>A prospective randomized trial has compared cyclophosphamide (CTX) with CTX plus cis-diamminodichloroplatinum (DDP) as the initial chemotherapy for advanced ovarian carcinoma. A secondary randomization compared the addition of BCG treatment to either chemotherapy. The addition of DDP had no measurable impact on survival, but a small survival trend favoring BCG-treated patients was noted (P less than 0.08).</s><s>Four hundred twenty-nine patients were entered into four prospective randomized clinical studies between January 1, 1973, and July 1, 1979. The records of 395 of these were analyzed to determine the proportion of patients surviving 48 months after therapy initiation. Combination-agent chemotherapy produced a larger proportion of 48-month survivors than single-agent therapy (P = 0.001); 70% of these survivors were clinically free of disease. Long-term survival was not totally dependent on a complete response to chemotherapy; in fact, persistent treatment with drug regimens induced bone marrow disorders and death due to toxicity in five patients. The continued fall in survival curves after 48 months suggests that current therapy regimens are not dramatically changing long-term survival rates.</s><s>Following surgical debulking, most patients with international Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) Stage III or IV carcinoma of the ovary receive treatment with combination chemotherapy. However, the optimal postsurgical therapy for ovarian carcinoma remains to be defined. Study endpoints included response to therapy, time to treatment failure, and overall survival. Between October, 1978, and November, 1980, EST 2878 accrued 253 patients with advanced epithelial carcinoma of the ovary. There were 118 eligible patients initially treated with melphalan and 126 with CHAD. Likewise, time to treatment failure was significantly longer in women receiving CHAD (P = 0.014), but the difference was again confined to women older than 50 years of age and to women suboptimally debulked at the time of surgery.</s><s>A randomized clinical trial was conducted in women with bulky (suboptimal) Stage III and Stage IV ovarian carcinoma, using doxorubicin (Adriamycin) and cyclophosphamide with or without cisplatin. One hundred twenty of these latter patients were treated with cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin (CA), while 107 received cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and cisplatin (CAP). The clinical complete response (CR) rate for CA was 26% (31/120) compared with 51% (55/107) for CAP (P = less than 0.0001). Thus, the addition of cisplatin improves the chemotherapy of advanced ovarian carcinoma.</s><s>From 1977 until 1980, 179 patients with newly diagnosed FIGO stages IIB, III or IV ovarian adenocarcinoma were randomized in a two-armed clinical trial: dihydroxybusulfan (B) 600 mg/m2 p.o. The treatment groups were comparable with respect to performance status, age and histology. No statistically significant difference was found in survival or response between the two single agents. No statistical difference in median survival was observed between single-drug treatment (12 months) and CAF (14 months), despite the fact that responders lived significantly longer than nonresponders (17 vs 10 months). In stage IIB patients receiving chemotherapy no benefit of pelvic irradiation was found. Two additional patients, who had microscopic disease removed at second-look laparotomy, seem to have been rescued by this procedure.</s><s>Sixty-one patients with FIGO stage III ovarian carcinoma and 30 patients with stage IV ovarian carcinoma were randomized to receive either high-dose cisplatin (100 mg/m2) or low-dose cisplatin (20 mg/m2) and chlorambucil. There was a strong trend for better survival in stage III (P less than .05) but not in stage IV patients treated with cisplatin alone.</s><s>The aim of this multicenter randomized trial was to compare carboplatin (400 mg/m2) and cisplatin (100 mg/m2) in patients with untreated advanced epithelial ovarian cancer. The median follow-up time was 15 months (maximum, 34); three patients in each treatment arm were not eligible (four, nonepithelial ovarian cancer type; one, no data, and one, stage II). In the carboplatin-treatment arm, the overall pathological response rate was 57.3% and the complete pathological response rate was 26.8%. There was no statistical difference in the two arms in survival or progression-free survival. Cisplatin was more nephrotoxic while carboplatin induced a higher degree of myelosuppression, especially thrombocytopenia; however, severe hematological toxicity was seldom observed. Further experience is needed to indicate whether or not carboplatin should completely displace cisplatin in the clinical treatment of ovarian cancer.</s><s>Melphalan (L-PAM) was compared to (C) cyclophosphamide, (M) methotrexate, and (F) 5-fluorouracil (CMF) in 413 patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma. Three hundred seventy-five patients have been analyzed (L-PAM, 190; CMF, 185). Response rates for patients with measurable and evaluable disease combined were similar: L-PAM, 32/130 (24%) (15% complete response); CMF, 47/132 (35%) (18% complete response). Patients with Stage IV measurable disease had a greater response rate to CMF, 22/52 (42%) versus L-PAM, 6/39 (15%). Survival and time to treatment failure were similar for both treatment regimens.</s><s>A phase III trial was performed between October 1981 and June 1984 to compare the efficacy of single-agent cisplatin and single-agent carboplatin in previously untreated patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage III or IV carcinoma of the ovary following surgery. This report describes the survival rates of patients in this study after a minimum follow-up duration of 8 years. Cisplatin was administered every 4 weeks for a total of 10 courses, courses 1 to 5 at a dosage of 100 mg/m2 and courses 6 to 10 at 30 mg/m2. Carboplatin was administered at a dosage of 400 mg/m2 every 4 weeks for 10 courses. Thirteen patients were excluded from response analyses because they were incorrectly randomized. Patients were crossed over to the other arm of the study because of progressive disease (PD), nonresponse, or toxicity. The median duration of response for the cisplatin and carboplatin arms was 21 months and 17 months, and the 5-year relapse-free survival rates were 22% and 25%, respectively.</s><s>We compared, in a multicentric randomised prospective study, the efficacy and toxicity of carboplatin 400 mg/m2 as a single agent (CB) to a combination of carboplatin 300 mg/m2, epirubicin 50 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (CB-EC) in advanced ovarian cancer patients. The treatment was scheduled to be administered every 3 weeks for six courses. Overall, clinical complete response was observed in 73 (56%) and partial response in 20 (15%) patients. The median time to progression was 16.89 months and median survival was 29.54 months. The prognostic role of residual disease after initial surgery, complete remission at second-look laparotomy, tumour stage and performance status was confirmed.</s><s>A total of 264 eligible patients with advanced ovarian cancer were randomised to single or triple agent cytotoxic therapy; 261 were available for analysis. Mortality attributed to cancer was slightly lower on arm T (p = 0.06), but this was offset by the greater toxicity of this regimen, and overall survival and activity index were similar on the two arms. Tumour mass removed at operation, extent of remaining tumour and age all showed significant correlation with prognosis. Survival was longer in patients whose disease responded to either therapeutic regimen.</s><s>The possible advantage of adding cisplatin (P) to cyclophosphamide (C) + adriamycin (A) in the management of stages III and IV ovarian cancer of epithelial origin was tested in a trial in which 149 patients were randomized to receive, after initial surgery, either CAP (C = 600 mg/sqm, A = 45 mg/sqm, P = 50 mg/sqm) or CA (C = 600 mg/sqm, A = 45 mg/sqm) every 4 weeks for 6 to 12 cycles, at which time follow-up laparotomoy was to be performed in responding or clinically disease-free patients. Fifteen patients were not included in the final analysis and the remaining 134 patients were considered fully or partially evaluable and are used in analysis of response and survival. However, more patients in the CA regimen had no macroscopic disease left after surgery than in CAP regimen (11 versus 6) and more patients in the CAP arm dose reductions and schedule delays than in the CA arm (61.1% versus 38.2%).</s><s>In a prospective, multicentre, randomized trial, the efficacy and tolerance of treosulfan alone was compared with that of treosulfan plus cisplatinum in 135 women with advanced ovarian carcinoma. Combined treatment was associated with significantly greater side-effects and haematological toxicity.</s><s>Given the potential for improved tolerance, a trial was initiated to compare the toxicity and efficacy of a standard regimen of cisplatin-cyclophosphamide (75 mg/m2 and 600 mg/m2, respectively) with an experimental regimen of carboplatin-cyclophosphamide (300 mg/m2 and 600 mg/m2, respectively) in women with postoperative macroscopic residual ovarian cancer. The treatments were equally deliverable, with 76% of patients completing their allocated regimen. The reported reasons for failure to complete treatment differed; toxicity/refusal predominated on the cisplatin arm, and progressive disease predominated on the carboplatin arm (P = .0092). Efficacy was similar, with no significant differences for the cisplatin and carboplatin arms in clinical response rate (57% v 59% in those with measurable disease), pathologic response rate (52% v 54% in those suitable for relaparotomy), time to progression (median, 56 v 58 weeks), or overall survival (median, 100 weeks v 110 weeks). It may be inappropriate to expect that any single regimen can be an effective therapy for all patients with advanced ovarian cancer.</s><s>The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of single and multiple drug chemotherapeutic regimens in the treatment of patients with advanced or recurrent, Stage III and IV, ovarian epithelial carcinoma. Four hundred and twenty-seven patients were in the study, 314 of whom are evaluable for progression-free interval (PFI), survival, and toxicity: 102 in regimen I, 80 in regimen II, 83 in regimen III, and 49 in regimen IV. Because of excessive toxicity, entry of patients to regimen IV was discontinued midway through the study. The overall toxicity was quite high but was most severe in regimen II and IV where 16 toxicity deaths were recorded.</s><s>A total of 76 patients with advanced epithelial ovarian carcinoma were randomised to receive 6 months of treatment with either a combination of hexamethylmelamine, 5-fluorouracil, cisplatin and prednimustine or prednimustine alone following initial surgery. Pathologically confirmed response rates were 35% for combination chemotherapy and 28% for prednimustine, and the overall survival was identical for the two groups. Seven patients achieved a pathologically defined complete response, one of whom relapsed at 8 months; the others remain disease-free 18-36 months (median, 23 months) after presentation.</s><s>In 1982 a randomized trial was started to compare a cisplatin-containing polychemotherapy (CAP: cyclophosphamide - CPA 750 mg/m2, adriamycin - ADM 50 mg/m2, cisplatin - P 50 mg/m2 on day 1 every 21 days) with full-dose cisplatin as single agent (P 60 mg/m2/day on days 1 and 2 every 28 days) in 44 patients undergoing exploratory laparotomy or debulking surgery for stage III-IV epithelial ovarian carcinoma with residual disease greater than 5 cm. On the basis of the final results the authors underline some data which, although merely indicative (because of the small number of patients) appear to be worth considering since they are in accordance with the latest reports: a) similar response rate (CR + PR = 47%) to first-line treatment in the two groups; b) the CAP treatment may achieve a longer median duration of CRs than the P treatment (20 versus 11 months); c) overall survival seems similar in the two groups of patients (19 versus 18 months), whereas the survival of CRs seems longer in the CAP treated patients (greater than 32 versus 25 months).</s><s>After intensive staging 74 ovarian cancer patients were randomized to two arms balanced for stage and post-surgery residual tumor.</s><s>A total of 161 previously untreated patients with FIGO stage III or IV epithelial ovarian cancer were randomised after surgery to receive six courses of either carboplatin 400 mg m-2 alone (Arm A) or carboplatin 300 mg m-2 with chlorambucil 10 mg day-1 for 7 days (Arm B). Failure to achieve a significant degree of leucopenia was associated with worse progression free survival (P less than 0.001). This may best be achieved by determining the initial dose based on renal function, and then adjusting subsequent doses according to nadir blood counts.</s>"

Eighty-eight patients were entered into this trial which has a median follow-up of 4.4 years.

Adriamycin was administered at 70 mg/m2 (slow push, every 3 weeks for seven courses for a maximum of 550 mg/m2). However, the disease-free interval was slightly different in favor of observation.

Patients were stratified for grade, size, extent of surgical margin, and soft tissue versus other sarcomas. While a nonsignificant difference in local control, metastasis-free survival, disease-free survival, and survival was observed for extremity lesions, the advantage may be outweighed by the risk of cardiotoxicity.

Seventeen patients received adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of doxorubicin (less than or equal to 550 mg/m2), cyclophosphamide (less than or equal to 5500 mg/m2), and methotrexate (less than or equal to 1000 mg/kg). Considering only patients with tumors of the trunk (22 patients), 3-year actuarial disease-free survival in the chemotherapy arm was 92%, compared to 47% in the no-chemotherapy arm (P = 0.006). Actuarial 3-year overall survival in the chemotherapy arm was 82%, compared to 61% in the no-chemotherapy arm (P = 0.18). An additional 26 patients were treated in an identical fashion, but were not part of the randomized trial because of contraindications to chemotherapy, refusal to enter the randomized trial, or because they were treated before 1977 in a trial in which all patients received chemotherapy. Considering the entire group of 57 patients, follow-up ranged from 10 to 86 months (median, 35 months). The most significant toxicity associated with chemotherapy was doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy, which resulted in clinically apparent congestive heart failure in five patients.

However, the optimal strategies for educating and counseling individuals have yet to be determined. Our goal was to evaluate the impact of alternate strategies for pretest education and counseling on decision-making regarding BRCA1 testing among women at low to moderate risk who have a family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer. Provision of a blood sample for future testing served as a proxy measure of intention to be tested (in the education and counseling arms of the study). The effects of intervention group on study outcomes were evaluated by use of hierarchical linear regression modeling and logistic regression modeling (for the blood sample outcome). The educational and counseling approaches both led to significant increases in knowledge, relative to the control condition (P < .001 for both). The counseling approach, but not the educational approach, was superior to the control condition in producing significant increases in perceived limitations and risks of BRCA1 testing (P < .01) and decreases in perceived benefits (P < .05). However, neither approach produced changes in intentions to have BRCA1 testing. Standard educational approaches may be equally effective as expanded counseling approaches in enhancing knowledge.

We sought to evaluate whether previsit educational decision aids facilitate shared decision making. The primary outcome was patient-reported level of control over the decision to be screened. Patients exposed to either aid were no more likely than control patients to report a collaborative decision: 36% of patients in each group reported equally sharing decision responsibility. Patients exposed to a decision aid answered a greater percentage of knowledge questions correctly (54% control vs 69% Web site, P <.001, and vs 69% brochure, P <.001) and were less likely to be screened (94% control vs 86% Web site, P = .06, and vs 85% brochure, P = .04). Patients in the decision aid groups were more informed and more engaged in the screening decision than their control counterparts.</s><s>(1)To compare an interactive multimedia decision aid (IMDA) with a leaflet and a video to give information about prenatal screening for Down syndrome and (2) to determine the women's acceptance of IMDA. There were no significant differences in the initial decision for and the final uptake of the prenatal screening test between the control and intervention groups. The proportion of women who were undecided was less than 10% in both groups. Significantly more women aged < 35 (88.1%) accepted IMDA than women aged > or = 35 (68.3%) (P = 0.030), but the logistic regression analysis did not confirm this finding after adjusting for other factors (computer knowledge and usage of computer). More women less than 35 years accepted IMDA probably because they used computer more frequently and had more computer knowledge.</s><s>A total of 363 (randomized trial) plus 206 (cohort study) patients with menorrhagia. An information booklet about menorrhagia and treatment options, mailed before the first visit to the outpatient clinic. Treatment decision within 3 months was made more often in the intervention group than in the control group (96% and 89% respectively, P = 0.02). Additional information did not increase the number of surgical procedures used, improve knowledge, or influence satisfaction or anxiety. Additional information led to an increase in specific treatment decisions and changed the distribution of used treatments without increasing the number of surgical procedures.</s><s>Little is known about the relative advantages of video versus internet-based decision aids to facilitate shared medical decision making. This study compared internet and video patient education modalities for men considering the prostate specific antigen (PSA) test. There were no between-groups differences in participants' ratings of convenience, effort, or satisfaction following exposure to the decision aid. Participants assigned to the video group were more likely to review the materials than individuals assigned to the internet group (98.2% vs 53.5%). Only 5% of all participants visited other websites to inform themselves about the PSA test.</s><s>Decision aids in North American breast cancer outpatients have been shown to assist with treatment decision making and reduce decisional conflict. Participants were followed up 1 week post-intervention with a retention rate of 92%. The intervention had no effect on uptake rates of treatment options, length of consultation with the surgeon, time point of treatment decision making, perceived involvement in decision making, neither decision related nor general patient satisfaction. Patients who received the decision aid intervention experienced a small benefit with regards to how informed they felt about advantages and disadvantages of relevant treatment options. Results are discussed in terms of contextual factors and individual differences as moderators of treatment decision aid effectiveness.</s><s>We conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of patient decision support Web sites on decision quality for men considering prostate cancer screening. Participants completed questionnaires at baseline and after their physical examination. Primary outcome measures were PSA test choice, prostate cancer treatment preferences, knowledge and concern about prostate cancer, and decisional conflict. Greater reductions in PSA screening from pretest to posttest were observed among participants assigned to the traditional decision aid (-9.1%) or chronic disease trajectory model (-8.7%), compared with participants assigned to the combination (-5.3%) or control (-3.3%) groups (P = .047). Public Web sites about prostate cancer provide less effective decision support than a specially designed Internet decision aid.</s><s>Despite the potential benefits of genetic testing for hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) risk, individuals can find the genetic testing decision-making process complicated and challenging. In all, 153 individuals were randomized to receive the decision aid or a control pamphlet at the end of their first genetic counseling consultation. Although the decision aid had no significant effect on postdecisional regret or actual genetic testing decision, the trial results demonstrated that participants who received the decision aid had significantly lower levels of decisional conflict (ie, uncertainty) regarding genetic testing (chi-square(1) = 8.97; P = .003) and were more likely to be classified as having made an informed choice concerning genetic testing (chi-square(1) = 4.37; P = .037) than participants who received a control pamphlet.</s><s>We developed an evidence-based decision aid for patients with advanced cystic fibrosis considering referral for lung transplantation. All participants received an education and counseling session from their cystic fibrosis team and were then randomized to receive the decision aid or usual care. The decision aid is available online at http://decisionaid.ohri.ca/decaids.html. The total decisional conflict score was significantly lower in the decision aid group 3 weeks postrandomization compared with the usual care group (11.6 vs. 20.4; P = 0.0007). Decisions were durable; 88% of patients in the decision aid group and 75% in the usual care group maintained the same choice 12 months after randomization (P = 0.06). Use of a decision aid for patients with cystic fibrosis considering referral for lung transplantation, in addition to usual education and counseling, improves patient knowledge, realistic expectations, decisional conflict, and patient satisfaction.</s><s>In early 1983, all 1,280 faculty and resident physicians at one hospital who were eligible to be vaccinated against hepatitis B were divided randomly into three groups: Group 1 physicians received general information about the risks and benefits of alternative vaccine decisions; Group 2 physicians were additionally invited to provide personal information for an individualized decision analysis (12.6 percent responded); and Group 3 physicians, who served as controls, were not contacted. In one year's follow-up, 20 percent of physicians were screened for hepatitis B antibody or vaccinated.</s><s>To examine the impact of a brief patient decision aid (pDA) on men's knowledge, attitudes and intention to have a prostate specific antigen (PSA) test. A brief pDA designed to facilitate informed decision-making for men considering PSA testing was developed for the NHS Prostate Cancer Risk Management Programme. Nine hundred and ninety of the men who were eligible for the study returned completed questionnaires (response rate=54%). There was no significant difference between the two groups in intention to be tested within the next 12 months. 87% of men found the brief pDA was easy to read, 94% considered it contained about the right amount of detail and 94% felt the information was presented in a balanced way. Men who received the brief pDA were significantly less positive about the PSA test, although there was no difference between the two groups regarding their intention to be tested within the next year. This brief pDA could serve as an acceptable and low cost adjunct to counselling by the General Practitioner (GP), and should promote informed decision making regarding the PSA test.</s><s>Studies have shown that patients with knee pain are not well informed of their potential treatment options and that patient preferences are often discordant with physician practices. The objective of this pilot study was to test the efficacy of a computer tool to improve informed decision-making for patients with knee pain in an outpatient primary care clinic setting. After performing the task, participants were given a printed handout illustrating their preferences. Decisional self-efficacy, preparedness to participate in decision-making, and arthritis self-efficacy were greater in participants randomized to the intervention arm compared to those receiving the information pamphlet (p < 0.05 for all comparisons).</s><s>Compliance with antipsychotic medication is a major issue in schizophrenia treatment, and noncompliance with antipsychotic treatment is closely related to relapse and rehospitalization. An enhanced involvement of patients with schizophrenia in treatment decisions (\"shared decision making\") is expected to improve long-term compliance and reduce rehospitalizations. The aim of the present analysis was to study whether shared decision making (SDM) in antipsychotic drug choice would influence long-term outcome. There were no differences between intervention and control groups in the univariate analyses. Additionally, a higher desire of the patient for autonomy and better knowledge at discharge were associated with higher hospitalization rates. The intervention studied showed a positive trend but no clear beneficial effect on long-term outcomes. Strategies to match these patients' needs might improve compliance and long-term outcomes.</s><s>The optimal mode of delivering Statin Choice (or any other decision aid) in clinical practice is unknown. To investigate the effect of mode of delivery on decision aid efficacy, the authors further explored the results of a concealed 2 x 2 factorial clustered randomized trial enrolling 21 endocrinologists and 98 diabetes patients and randomizing them to 1) receive either the decision aid or pamphlet about cholesterol, and 2) have these delivered either during the office visit (by the clinician) or before the visit (by a researcher). The relative efficacy of the decision aid v. pamphlet interacted with the mode of delivery.</s><s>This investigation examined factors affecting patient involvement in consultations to decide local treatment for early breast cancer and the effectiveness of two methods of preconsultation education aimed at increasing patient participation in these discussions. College-educated patients younger than 65 years of age were more active participants in these consultations than were older, less educated patients. In addition, patients showed more involvement when they interacted with physicians who encouraged and facilitated patient participation. Although patients vary in their expressiveness, physicians may be able to increase patient participation in deciding treatment by using patient-centered behavior. Also, preconsultation education appears to be an effective clinical strategy for helping patients gain an accurate understanding of their treatment options before meeting with physicians.</s><s>Decision aids can increase patient involvement in treatment decision making. Between October 1996 and February 1998, 894 women with uncomplicated menorrhagia were recruited from 6 hospitals in southwest England. Self-reported health status was the main outcome; secondary outcomes included treatments received and costs. The interview group had lower mean costs ($1566) than the control group ($2751) (mean difference, $1184; 95% CI, $684-$2110) and the information group $2026 (mean difference, $461; 95% CI, $236-$696). Providing women with information alone did not affect treatment choices; however, the addition of an interview to clarify values and elicit preferences had a significant effect on women's management and resulted in reduced costs.</s><s>This surgery is usually elective, so patient preferences are important in the treatment decision. The objective of this study was to determine the impact on outcomes and surgical choices of an interactive, diagnosis-specific videodisk program for informing patients about treatment choices. Elective surgery candidates (n = 393) included 171 patients with herniated disks, 110 with spinal stenosis, and 112 with other diagnoses. Symptom and functional outcomes at 3 months and 1 year were similar between study groups. Among patients with herniated disks, those in the video group underwent significantly less surgery (32% versus 47%, P = 0.05 by Kaplan-Meier test). The program appears to facilitate decision making and may help to ensure informed consent.</s><s>To examine who reported using unsolicited prostate cancer screening decision aids distributed as part of a randomized controlled trial, whether reported use varied by type of aid (video or pamphlet), and what affect reported use had on study outcomes. Materials were mailed 2 weeks prior to clinic appointments in general internal medicine. Fifty-six percent of those randomized to receive the video and 50% of those randomized to receive the pamphlet reported using the materials. Adjusting for reported use modestly increased the estimated differences across treatment groups but did not substantially change conclusions about the relative effects of these aids on knowledge. Efforts to broadly implement decision aids may need to offer a variety of approaches, and incorporate creative strategies to enhance reaching all population subgroups.</s><s>Too few patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) receive appropriate antithrombotic therapy. We tested the short-term (primary outcome) and long-term (secondary outcome) effect of a patient decision aid on the appropriateness of antithrombotic therapy among patients with NVAF. The primary outcome measure was change in antithrombotic therapy at 3 months. Appropriateness of therapy was defined using the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) recommendations. The mean patient age was 72 years, and the median duration of NVAF was 5 years. In the control group, there was a 3% decrease over 3 months in the number of patients receiving therapy appropriate to their risk of stroke (40% [85/215] at baseline v. 37% [79/215] at 3 months). In the intervention group, the number of patients receiving therapy appropriate to their stroke risk increased by 9% (32% [69/219] at baseline v. 41% [89/219] at 3 months).</s><s>To evaluate the impact of a patient decision aid (PDA) regarding the use of natural health products (NHPs) at menopause on decisional conflict, knowledge of NHPs, congruence between values and choice, persistence with an option, intention to disclose the use of NHPs to a physician or a pharmacist and intention to use decision support interventions in the future. A randomized controlled trial in which 90 women, aged 45-64 years, facing a decision about using NHPs for menopausal symptoms, received a PDA (experimental group) or a general information brochure about menopause (control group). Measures Women were evaluated at baseline and after a two-week period using the decisional conflict scale (DCS). Both groups experienced a statistically significant reduction on the DCS (-0.55 +/- 0.59, P < 0.0001 versus -0.52 +/- 0.73, P < 0.0001). However, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups (P = 0.32).</s><s>As genetic testing for susceptibility to breast cancer becomes more widespread, alternative methods for educating individuals prior to testing will be needed. Our objective was to compare face-to-face education and counseling by a genetic counselor with education by an interactive computer program, assessing the effects of each on knowledge of breast cancer genetics and intent to undergo genetic testing. The control group participants correctly answered 74% of the knowledge questions; the counselor group, 92%; and the computer group, 96% (P <.0001). Unadjusted mean knowledge scores were significantly higher in the computer group than the counselor group (P =.048), but they were equivalent when adjusted for demographic differences (P = 0.34).</s><s>Low utilization of effective coronary heart disease (CHD) prevention strategies may be due to many factors, but chief among them is the lack of patient involvement in prevention decisions. 78% had at least one option to reduce their CHD risk, but only 45% accurately identified the strategies best supported by evidence. In unadjusted analysis, the decision aid increased the proportion of patients who discussed CHD risk reduction with their doctor from 24% to 40% (absolute difference 16%; 95% CI -4% to +37%) and increased the proportion who had a specific plan to reduce their risk from 24% to 37% (absolute difference 13%; 95% CI -7% to +34%). Our study confirms patients' limited knowledge about their CHD risk and effective risk reduction options and provides preliminary evidence that an individually-tailored decision aid about CHD prevention might be expected to increase patients' discussions about CHD prevention with their doctor and their plans for CHD risk reduction. These findings should be replicated in studies with a larger sample size and patients at overall higher risk of CHD.</s><s>To evaluate a patient-educational approach to shared decision making for prostate cancer screening. Randomized controlled trial with preoffice visit assessment and 2-week follow-up. Men aged 45 through 70 years with no history of prostate cancer or treatment for prostate disease (N = 160). Intervention subjects rated favorably the amount of information provided and the clarity, balance, and length of the videotape and would recommend the videotape to others. Patient education regarding the potential benefits and harms of early detection of prostate cancer can lead to more informed decision making.</s><s>There is a lack of evidence regarding the value of tools designed to aid decision making in patients with newly diagnosed hypertension. To evaluate two interventions for assisting newly diagnosed hypertensive patients in the decision whether to start drug therapy for reducing blood pressure. Decision analysis patients had lower decisional conflict than those who did not receive this intervention (27.6 versus 38.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] for adjusted difference = -13.0 to -5.8, P < 0.001), greater knowledge about hypertension (73% versus 67%, adjusted 95% CI = 2% to 9%, P = 0.003) and no evidence of increased state anxiety (34.8 versus 36.8, adjusted 95% CI = -5.6 to 0.1, P = 0.055). This trial demonstrates that, among patients facing a real treatment decision, interventions to inform patients about hypertension and to clarify patients' values concerning outcomes of treatment are effective in reducing decisional conflict and increasing patient knowledge, while not resulting in any increases in state anxiety.</s><s>To determine the effects of two computer based decision aids on decisional conflict and mode of delivery among pregnant women with a previous caesarean section. 742 pregnant women with one previous lower segment caesarean section and delivery expected at >or=37 weeks. Decision analysis: mode of delivery was recommended based on utility assessments performed by the woman combined with probabilities of clinical outcomes within a concealed decision tree. Both interventions were delivered via a laptop computer after brief instructions from a researcher. Decision aids can help women who have had a previous caesarean section to decide on mode of delivery in a subsequent pregnancy.</s><s>The objective of this randomized, controlled study was to determine the usefulness of a decision aid on pre-donation of autologous blood before elective open heart surgery. The decision aid (DA) group received a tape and booklet which described the options for peri-operative transfusion in detail. The DA group rated themselves better prepared for decision making and showed significant improvements in knowledge (p = 0.001) and realistic risk perceptions (p = 0.001). In both groups there was an increase in the proportion of patients choosing allogeneic blood between baseline and follow-up (p = 0.001).</s><s>To carry out a randomized controlled trial of a decision aid for women at increased risk of developing ovarian cancer to facilitate decision making regarding risk management options. This randomized trial, conducted through 6 familial cancer centers, compared the efficacy of tailored decision aid to that of a general educational pamphlet in preparing women for decision making. 131 women with a family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer or of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. Decisional conflict, knowledge about ovarian cancer risk management options, and psychological adjustment were reassessed at 3 time points. This form of educational material is successful in increasing knowledge about risk management options and in reducing decisional conflict in the shorter term.</s><s>A decision aid for the surgical treatment of early breast cancer was evaluated in a randomized controlled trial. The decision aid, a tape and workbook, includes explicit presentation of probabilities, photographs and graphics, and a values clarification exercise. Patients completed a questionnaire prior to using the decision aid, after reviewing it but prior to surgery, and 6 months after enrollment. There was no difference in anxiety, knowledge, or decisional regret across the 2 groups. A subgroup of women who were initially leaning toward mastectomy or were unsure had lower decisional conflict.</s><s>Despite increased interest among the public in breast cancer genetic risk and genetic testing, there are limited services to help women make informed decisions about genetic testing. This study, conducted with female callers (N = 279) to the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) Atlantic Region Cancer Information Service (CIS), developed and evaluated a theory-based, educational intervention designed to increase callers' understanding of the following: (a) the kinds of information required to determine inherited risk; (b) their own personal family history of cancer; and (c) the benefits and limitations of genetic testing. Callers requesting information about breast/ovarian cancer risk, risk assessment services, and genetic testing were randomized to either: (1) standard care or (2) an educational intervention. In addition, high monitors, who typically attend to and seek information, demonstrated greater increases in knowledge and perceived risk over the 6-month interval than low monitors, who typically are distracted from information.</s><s>Decision-making about mode of birth after a cesarean delivery presents challenges to women and their caregivers and requires a balance of risks and benefits according to individual circumstances. The study objective was to determine whether a decision-aid for women who have experienced previous cesarean birth facilitates informed decision-making about birth options during a subsequent pregnancy. Women with 1 previous cesarean section and medically eligible for trial of vaginal birth were recruited at 12 to 18 weeks' gestation; 115 were randomized to the intervention group and 112 to the control group. A decision-aid booklet describing risks and benefits of elective repeat cesarean section and trial of labor was given to intervention group women at 28 weeks' gestation. Main outcome measures included level of knowledge, decisional conflict score, women's preference for mode of birth, and recorded mode of birth. Preferences expressed at 36 weeks were not consistent with actual birth outcomes for many women. A decision-aid for women facing choices about birth after cesarean section is effective in improving knowledge and reducing decisional conflict. However, little evidence suggested that this process led to an informed choice.</s><s>The aim of this secondary analysis was to compare the effects of a tailored decision aid (DA) with those of a pamphlet on the agreement between women's and physicians' decisional conflict about hormone replacement therapy (HRT). The ICC was higher for dyads in the DA group (ICC=0.44; 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.25-0.59) compared to the pamphlet group (ICC=0.28; 95% CI=0.06-0.47).</s><s>Seventy-four patients, ranging in age from 15 to 50 and presenting with a moderate to severe dentofacial deformity requiring orthognathic surgery, were randomly assigned to a video imaging or a standard case presentation (CP) group. Motives for treatment did not differ significantly between the video image and standard CP groups. Two weeks after the case presentation, 60% of the standard CP group and 74% of the video image group ranked the anticipated change in facial appearance as an important factor in making a treatment decision. The presentation of video images appears to be a valuable information source for conveying treatment options to patients, but caution may be needed to prevent elevated or possibly unrealistic treatment expectations.</s><s>The concept of shared decision making (SDM) is an important emerging trend in clinical medicine but has received little or no attention in the dental literature. Decision aids can play a useful role in SDM by helping patients and clinicians choose among reasonable alternative treatment options. After treatment discussion, a brief questionnaire was completed by the patient to measure knowledge, satisfaction, and anxiety. Patients in the EndoDB group (n=32) demonstrated a small, but statistically significant, increase in knowledge (t-test; difference=+0.37; p=0.03) compared to the usual care group (n=35). Decision aids may emerge as a useful tool to facilitate SDM and evidence-based clinical practice.</s><s>To evaluate the effectiveness of a decision aid to help women choose between surgical and medical methods of pregnancy termination. All women less than 9 weeks of gestation referred for termination of pregnancy over 7 months in 2002. Participants were given an envelope containing either the decision-aid or the control leaflet prior to choosing between medical and surgical termination methods and completed two questionnaires, one immediately after this consultation and another after the termination procedure. Choice of termination method; measures of effective decision making including risk perception, attitudes and knowledge of both the medical and surgical methods; decisional conflict; anxiety and usefulness of the leaflet.</s><s>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the incremental effect of a graphic weigh-scale values clarification exercise to explicitly consider the personal importance of the benefits versus the risks in a woman's decision aid regarding postmenopausal hormone therapy. SAMPLE: Two-hundred and one women aged 50-69 years from Ottawa, Canada, who had never used hormone therapy. OUTCOME: Perceived clarity of values, a sub-scale of the decisional conflict scale; congruence between personal values of benefits and risks (measured on 0-10 importance rating scale) and choices (accept, decline, unsure regarding preventive hormone therapy [HRT]) using discriminant function analysis. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between interventions in perceived clarity of values and overall congruence between values and choices.</s><s>As the availability of and demand for genetic testing for hereditary cancers increases in primary care and other clinical settings, alternative or adjunct educational methods to traditional genetic counseling will be needed. Outpatient clinics offering cancer genetic counseling at 6 US medical centers enrolled 211 women with personal or family histories of breast cancer. Participants' knowledge, risk perception, intention to undergo genetic testing, decisional conflict, satisfaction with decision, anxiety, and satisfaction with the intervention. Counselor group measures were administered at baseline and after counseling. Outcomes were analyzed by high vs low risk of carrying a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. Knowledge scores increased in both groups (P<.001) regardless of risk status, and change in knowledge was greater in the computer group compared with the counselor group (P =.03) among women at low risk of carrying a mutation. Perception of absolute risk of breast cancer decreased significantly after either intervention among all participants. Intention to undergo testing decreased significantly after either intervention among low-risk but not high-risk women. Mean state anxiety scores were reduced by counseling but were within normal ranges for both groups at baseline and after either intervention, regardless of risk status.</s><s>Guidelines for fetal aneuploidy testing recommend that screening and diagnostic testing be made available to pregnant women of all ages and that providers explain the differences between these tests to help their patients make informed testing decisions. We sought to estimate the effect of a computerized, interactive prenatal testing decision tool on prenatal testing decision making. Primary outcomes were knowledge, risk awareness, intervention satisfaction, decisional conflict, and among women aged at least 35 years, use of invasive diagnostic testing. Women assigned to the interactive prenatal testing decision tool had higher knowledge scores (79.5% compared with 64.9%, P<.001), were more likely to correctly estimate their risk of procedure-related miscarriage (64.9% compared with 48.1%, P=.002) and carrying a Down syndrome-affected fetus (63.5% compared with 15.1%, P<.001), were more satisfied with the intervention (P<.001), and had less decision uncertainty (P<.001) than controls after viewing the intervention.</s><s>Previous studies have not assessed whether evidence-based information about the outcomes of colorectal cancer screening increases informed choice among people from a range of socioeconomic backgrounds nor have they assessed whether this can be administered away from a health-care provider. Significantly more DA recipients (20.9%) were 'informed' compared with G recipients (5.8%) (P = 0.0001, OR 4.32; 95% CI 2.49 to 7.52); the DA did not affect values clarity (61.9% clear after DA versus 59.1% after G) nor screening decisions overall (87.3% would screen after DA versus 90.5% after G). Decisions not to screen were equally uncommon in both groups but more likely to be uninformed in G (P = 0.03). Detailed absolute risk and benefit information about FOBT screening can be effectively used at home by people to increase informed choice.</s><s>Parental information and circumcision in highly motivated couples with higher education.</s><s>To evaluate an entertainment-based patient decision aid for prostate cancer screening among patients with low or high health literacy. Male primary care patients from two clinical sites, one characterized as serving patients with low health literacy (n=149) and the second as serving patients with high health literacy (n=301), were randomized to receive an entertainment-based decision aid for prostate cancer screening or an audiobooklet-control aid with the same learner content but without the entertainment features. Entertainment education may be an effective strategy for promoting informed decision making about prostate cancer screening among patients with lower health literacy.</s><s>To evaluate a shared decision-making intervention (SDMI) for BRCA1/2 mutation carriers who have to make a choice between screening and prophylactic surgery for breasts and/or ovaries. After the baseline assessment (2 weeks after a positive DNA test result), women were randomly assigned to the SDMI group (n = 44), receiving the SDMI 2 months after the test result, or to the control group (n = 44). The short- and long-term effects, 3 and 9 months after the test result, were assessed using questionnaires. Data were collected on well-being, treatment choice, and decision-related outcomes. In the long term, interaction effects between the SDMI and cancer history were found. Supporting decision making in a systematic way using trade-offs is beneficial for these women.</s><s>To evaluate the impact of a decision aid for women considering genetic testing for breast/ovarian cancer risk given during genetic counseling. When the patient received the decision aid, it was used to complement consultation discussions about genetic testing. One hundred and ten (74.3%) women completed the first questionnaire designed to elicit information about women's levels of decisional conflict and knowledge about genetic testing. Results showed that women who received the decision aid felt more informed about genetic testing (chi(2)(1)=8.69; P=0.003), had clearer values (chi(2)(1)=6.90; P=0.009) and had higher knowledge levels (chi(2)(2)=6.49; P=0.039) than women who received the control pamphlet.</s><s>To measure the effectiveness of a tailored decision aid (DA) designed to help women make informed decisions about genetic testing for breast/ovarian cancer risk. While the DA had no effect on informed choice, post-decisional regret or actual genetic testing decision, the trial showed that women who received the DA had higher knowledge levels and felt more informed about genetic testing than women who received the control pamphlet (chi(2)(2) = 6.82; P = 0.033; chi(2)(1) = 4.86; P = 0.028 respectively). Women who received the DA were less likely to share the information with other family members than women in the control condition (chi(2)(1) = 8.78; P = 0.003). Decision aids are an effective decision-support strategy for women considering genetic testing for breast/ovarian cancer risk, and are most effective before the patient has made a decision, which is generally at the point of having blood drawn.</s><s>In recent years, patients have indicated a desire for more information about their disease and to be involved in making decisions about their care. We developed an aid called the \"Decision Board\" to help clinicians inform patients with lymph node-negative breast cancer of the risks and benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy. We determined whether adding the Decision Board to the medical consultation improved patient knowledge and satisfaction compared with the medical consultation alone. Between October 1995 and March 2000, 176 women with lymph node-negative breast cancer who were candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy were randomly assigned to receive the Decision Board plus the medical consultation (83 patients) or the medical consultation alone (93 patients). Over the entire study period, satisfaction with decision making was higher for patients in the Decision Board arm than for patients in the control arm (P =.032).</s><s>To determine whether a decision aid on hormone replacement therapy influences decision making and health outcomes. Patients' and general practitioners' perceptions of who made the decision, decisional conflict, treatment choice, menopausal symptoms, costs, anxiety, and general health status. At three months a lower proportion of women in the intervention group than in the control group were undecided about treatment (14% v 26%; -12%, -23% to -0.4%), and a higher proportion had decided against hormone replacement therapy (46% v 32%; 14%, 1% to 28%); these differences were no longer apparent by nine months. No differences were found between the groups for anxiety, use of health service resources, general health status, or utility.</s><s>The long-term results of randomized trials have demonstrated equivalent survival rates for mastectomy and breast-conserving therapy for the treatment of early stage breast cancer. Consequently, the choice of treatment should be based on a patient's preferences. Of the 208 eligible women with newly diagnosed clinical stage I or II breast cancer seen by study surgeons, 201 agreed to be evaluated: 94 were assigned to the decision board and 107 to usual practice. Patient knowledge about the surgical treatment of breast cancer; decisional conflict; satisfaction with decision making; and the treatment decision following the consultation. The decision board was helpful in improving communication and enabling women to make a choice regarding treatment. Such instruments should be considered by surgeons when communicating the different surgical options to women with breast cancer.</s><s>To determine whether a decision aid on benign prostatic hypertrophy influences decision making, health outcomes, and resource use. Intervention: Patients' decision aid consisting of an interactive multimedia programme with booklet and printed summary. Patients in the intervention group had significantly lower decisional conflict scores than those in the control group at three months (2.3 v 2.6; -0.3, -0.5 to -0.1, P<0.01) and this was maintained at nine months. The decision aid reduced decisional conflict in men with benign prostatic hypertrophy, and the patients played a more active part in decision making.</s><s>To compare the efficacy of a decision-making aid with an information document from the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) with regard to decisions about hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Subjects were given a manual and an audiocassette describing a six-step approach to making a decision about HRT. Anxiety levels were significantly reduced in both groups, but the difference between the effectiveness of the two interventions was not significant (P = .77). The six-step approach to decision making was more helpful than the SOGC's information document in increasing subjects' knowledge of the risks and benefits of HRT, in creating more realistic expectations of HRT, and in increasing the congruence between subjects' personal values and their decisions on HRT.</s><s>This study sought to evaluate a shared decision-making aid for breast cancer prevention care designed to help women make appropriate prevention decisions by presenting information about risk in context. The decision aid was feasible to use during the consultations as measured by consultation duration, user satisfaction, patient knowledge, and decisional conflict. The mean consultation duration was not significantly different between groups (24 minutes for intervention group versus 21 minutes for control group, p = 0.42). The majority found the decision aid acceptable and useful and would recommend it to others. However, the knowledge scores returned to baseline at follow-up in both groups. Decision preference for patients who chose chemoprevention post consultations remained constant at follow-up for the intervention group, but not for the control group. The tendency for the decision choices and knowledge scores to return to baseline at follow-up suggests the need for initial and ongoing prevention decision support.</s><s>To study the effect of an educational videotape about poliovirus vaccines and choices of schedules for parents/guardians of children starting the polio vaccination series. Five pediatric offices (two university-based, two health maintenance organization staff models, and one private practice) and a local health department immunization clinic in the greater Lansing, MI, area. A total of 287 parents/guardians of 2- to 3-month-olds presenting for well-child care and due for the first set of immunizations including poliovirus vaccine. Parents/guardians were randomized to read the vaccine information statement (VIS) alone or to read the VIS and view a 15-minute videotape about polio vaccination and choices of schedules produced by Michigan State University. The intervention groups were similar by race/ethnicity, education, and relationship to the child. Reading the VIS did improve posttest scores for those assigned to VIS only, but these scores still were not as high as for videotape viewers who did not read the VIS. As immunization schedules increase in complexity and parents are asked to make more choices, videotaped information may be a better method to achieve the goal of truly informed consent.</s><s>To evaluate the effects of an evidence-based patient decision aid (DA) on multiple sclerosis (MS) immunotherapy. An intervention group (IG) received the DA and a control group (CG) received standard information. Primary outcome measure was the match between the patient's preferred and actual roles during consultation with the physician. Data were collected at baseline, after receiving the information, after consultation with the physician and 6 months after baseline. The percentage of preference matches did not differ between groups (IG 49%, CG 51%, P = 0.71). IG patients temporarily became more critical of immunotherapy and rated the information as significantly more helpful.</s><s>Despite the burden of colorectal cancer and improved health care outcomes with early detection and treatment, screening rates among eligible adults are low. From May 2002 to December 2003, we conducted a randomized controlled trial of Colorectal Web compared to a standard Web site on colorectal cancer screening in urban, suburban, and rural communities in Michigan with high colorectal cancer burden. Major outcome was screened for colorectal cancer by 24 weeks post-intervention. Eighty-nine participants had been screened for colorectal cancer by 24 weeks post-intervention. The probability of being screened for the Colorectal Web intervention study arm compared to the control is OR=3.23 (2.73-3.50 95% Confidence Interval).</s><s>Because of the many uncertainties surrounding screening for prostate cancer, authorities recommend that patients be involved in the screening decision. To determine the impact of informed consent on patient interest in undergoing prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening. Men 50 years or older with no prior PSA testing and no history of prostate cancer presenting to 1 of 4 university-affiliated primary care practices were eligible for enrollment. The main outcome measure was patient interest in undergoing PSA screening measured on a 5-point Likert scale. Patients who received the informational intervention were significantly less interested in undergoing PSA screening than controls (mean difference in interest, 0.8 on 5-point scale, P < .001). For physicians who offer the PSA as a screening test, this finding highlights the importance of apprising patients of the associated benefits, burdens, and uncertainties and allowing them to participate in the screening decision.</s><s>The purpose of this study was to develop and test a decision support intervention (DSI) to assist women to make and act on informed decisions that are consistent with their values in the area of menopause and hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Mode and intensity of intervention were tested in midlife women (N = 248), randomly assigned to one of three intervention formats: written information only, guided discussion, or personalized decision exercise. Women's adherence to their own plans over 12 months was 59% (exercise), 76% (calcium intake), and 89% (HRT). Carefully written information is effective in promoting knowledge, adherence, and satisfaction among well-educated, interested women.</s><s>Computerized decision aids have the potential to increase patient involvement in the decision-making process. One hundred forty-nine women presenting with menorrhagia were randomized to receive written information and access to a computerized decision aid or written information alone. These were scores on the Decisional Conflict Scale and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory anxiety scale at 2 weeks and the Menorrhagia Specific Utility quality-of-life scale, knowledge about menorrhagia, and anxiety and process measures at 6 months. A computerized decision aid, used outside of the primary care consultation, is effective in increasing patient involvement in decision making in primary care.</s><s>Efforts to educate men about the controversy surrounding prostate cancer screening are well intended but rarely evaluated rigorously. We evaluated an evidence-based (EB) booklet for men designed to promote informed decision-making. Men aged 40-70 years were recruited from the practices of 13 local general practitioners (GPs) in Sydney, Australia. Compared with those receiving conventional information, men receiving the EB booklet had significantly improved knowledge (50% of items correct, 95% CI 46-53%; vs 45% correct, 95% CI 42-48%) (p = 0.048) and lower levels of decisional conflict (mean 21.6, 95% CI 20.7-22.5; vs mean 24.3, 95% CI 23.4-25.2) (p < 0.001). Interest in PSA screening was significantly reduced in both groups at post-test (p < 0.001). Men preferring a \"passive\" approach to decision-making gained as much from our EB booklet as those with \"active\" or \"collaborative\" preferences. Our EB booklet facilitated informed choice, even among \"passive\" decision-makers.</s><s>Randomised evaluations of resources to facilitate informed decisions about prostate cancer screening are rarely conducted. Men in all three groups demonstrated significant increases in knowledge scores from pre to post-test. Scores were significantly modified by men's preferences for decisional control (P = 0.002). Men receiving the evidence-based booklet also were less likely to accept a recommendation by a GP to undergo prostate-specific-antigen (PSA) screening (P = 0.003). Men require detailed information about the pros and cons of PSA screening in order to make an informed decision.</s><s>To conduct a pilot test of a decision aid designed to help patients choose among currently recommended colorectal cancer screening programs. Randomized controlled trial comparing a patient decision aid based on multicriteria decision-making theory with a simple educational intervention. Decision outcome was defined as the proportion of colorectal cancer screening plans carried out. After controlling for the effects of the physicians in a factorial analysis of variance, patients who used the decision aid had lower decisional conflict regarding colorectal cancer screening decisions (F ratio 6.47, P = 0.01) due to increased knowledge, better clarity of values, and higher ratings of the quality of the decisions they made. There was no difference between the groups in decision outcomes: 52% of patients in the control group and 49% in the experimental group completed planned screening tests (P = 1.0).</s><s>Many women who have participated in mammography screening are now approaching 70 years of age. These women are advised to consider both the benefits and harms of continuing to be screened. Doing so may be difficult for individual women, and there are no evaluated decision support tools to assist them. Women aged 70 years who had regularly participated in mammography screening were eligible to participate in the trial. Women received a DA providing balanced, quantitative information or standard information available from the screening program. The DA is an effective way to assist women to make a decision about continuing mammography screening and seems to be a feasible intervention within a population screening program.</s><s>Decision aids are tools designed to help patients participate in the clinical decision-making process. To determine whether use of an audiobooklet (AB) decision aid explaining the results of a clinical trial affected the decision-making process of study participants. A total of 287 patients from the SPAF III aspirin cohort study, in which patients with atrial fibrillation and a relatively low risk of stroke received 325 mg/d of aspirin and were followed up for a mean of 2 years. Patients' ability to make choices regarding antithrombotic therapy, and 6-month adherence to these decisions. Their knowledge, expectations, decisional conflict (the amount of uncertainty about the course of action to take), and satisfaction with the decision-making process were also measured. More patients in the AB group made a choice about antithrombotic therapy than in the control group (99% vs 94%; P = .02).</s><s>The purpose of this study was to explore the hypothesis that assisting men with prostate cancer to obtain information would enable them to assume a more active role in treatment decision making and decrease their levels of anxiety and depression. Respondents were recruited from one community urology clinic in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Sixty newly diagnosed men were randomly assigned to receive either a self-efficacy information intervention that consisted of a written information package with discussion, a list of questions they could ask their physician, and an audiotape of the medical consultation (n = 30), or a written information package alone (n = 30). This group of older men do want to be informed and participate in medical decisions.</s><s>Prostate cancer screening with serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and digital rectal examination (DRE) continues to increase. Our goal was to test the effect of a prostate cancer screening decision-aid on patients' knowledge, beliefs, and use of prostate cancer screening tests. We included 257 men aged 50 to 80 years who were receiving primary care at a Department of Veterans Affairs Hospital in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The illustrated pamphlet decision-aid was effective in improving knowledge of prostate cancer screening tests: 95% of the experimental group were aware of the possibility of false-negative test results compared with 85% of the comparison group (P <.01). When used in a primary care setting, an illustrated pamphlet decision-aid was effective in increasing knowledge of prostate cancer screening tests but did not change the use of these tests.</s><s>Decision-making at menopause remains a challenge for women and their health care providers as the paradigm for hormone therapy continues to evolve. Participants found the computer-based decision-aid easy to use and retained risk information incorporated from emerging scientific data. A trend was reported towards decreased decisional conflict in the evidence in decision-making (p=0.07) and factors of uncertainty (p=0.06) domains among the subset of participants who were on HT at baseline and used the computer-based decision-aid.</s><s>The recent identification of several BRCA1/BRCA2 founder mutations among Ashkenazi Jewish individuals has led to increased salience of BRCA1/BRCA2 testing for Jewish individuals. The goal of the current study was to examine whether a brief educational booklet regarding BRCA1/BRCA2 testing would influence knowledge, attitudes, and interest in testing among Ashkenazi Jewish women from the general population. After a baseline telephone interview, participants were randomized to receive either genetic testing educational print materials (n = 195 women) or general breast cancer education control materials (n = 196 women). One month after receiving these materials, the authors reassessed knowledge, attitudes, and interest in BRCA1/BRCA2 gene testing. This approach may be used to educate low-risk individuals about the benefits and risks/limitations of BRCA1/BRCA2 testing, so that they can make informed decisions about whether to pursue genetic counseling.</s><s>To evaluate the effectiveness of a decision aid for prenatal testing of fetal abnormalities compared with a pamphlet in supporting women's decision making. GPs were randomised to provide women with either a decision aid or a pamphlet. The decision aid was a 24-page booklet designed using the Ottowa Decision Framework. Validated scales were used to measure the primary outcomes, informed choice and decisional conflict, and the secondary outcomes, anxiety, depression, attitudes to the pregnancy/fetus and acceptability of the resource. A greater proportion of women in the intervention group 88% (147/167) had a 'good' level of knowledge than those in the control group 72% (123/171) (adjusted OR 3.43; 95% CI 1.79-6.58). There was no strong evidence of differences between the trial arms in the measures of psychological or acceptability outcomes.</s><s>An interactive digital education aid for breast reconstruction patients was developed because of a perceived need to provide patients with more education regarding the treatment so that they can make better informed treatment decisions. Breast cancer patients who were candidates for breast reconstruction were recruited and randomized into a control group and a study group. A total of 133 women participated, 66 in the control group and 67 in the study group. They also tended to have a reduced mean level of anxiety and increased satisfaction with the treatment choice compared with the control group. An interactive digital education aid is a beneficial educational adjunct for patients contemplating breast reconstruction.</s><s>Genetic testing is increasingly part of routine clinical care for women with a family history of breast cancer. To help BRCA1/2 carriers make this decision, the authors developed a computer-based interactive decision aid that was tested against usual care in a randomized controlled trial. After the completion of genetic counseling, 214 female (aged 21-75) BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers were randomized to Usual Care (UC; N = 114) or Usual Care plus Decision Aid (DA; N = 100) arms. Longitudinal analyses revealed that the DA was effective among carriers who were initially undecided about how to manage their breast cancer risk.</s><s>To determine the effect of the Ischemic Heart Disease Shared Decision-Making Program (IHD SDP) an interactive videodisc designed to assist patients in the decision-making process involving treatment choices for ischemic heart disease, on patient decision-making. Two hundred forty ambulatory patients with\n                The primary outcome was patient satisfaction with the decision-making process. Outcomes were measured at the time of treatment decision and/or at 6 months follow-up. The intervention group had higher knowledge scores (75% vs 62%; 95% CI for 13% difference, 8% to 18%). At 6 months, 52% of the intervention group and 66% of the controls had undergone revascularization (95% CI for 14% difference, 0% to 28%). Exposure to the IHD SDP resulted in more patient-angiographer disagreement about treatment decisions.</s><s>Patient involvement in the choice of antihyperglycemic agents could improve adherence and optimize glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Twenty-one clinicians were randomized to use the decision aid during the clinical encounter and 19 to dispense usual care and an educational pamphlet. At 6-month follow-up, both groups had nearly perfect medication use (median, 100% of days covered), with better adherence (AMD, 9% more days covered; 95% CI, 4%-14%) and persistence (AMD, 12 more days covered; 95% CI, 3-21 days) in the usual care group, and no significant impact on HbA(1c) levels (AMD, 0.01; 95% CI, -0.49 to 0.50).</s><s>This study was a randomized trial to test the impact of an informed decision-making intervention on prostate cancer screening use. Participants completed a baseline survey questionnaire and were randomly assigned either to a Standard Intervention (SI) group (N=121) or an Enhanced Intervention (EI) group (N=121). An endpoint chart audit was performed six months after initial intervention contact. EI group men had a screening frequency two times greater than that of SI group men, but the difference was not statistically significant: 8% vs. 4 % (OR = 1.94) fo rcomplete screening, and 19% vs. 10% (OR = 2.08) for complete or partial screening.</s><s>OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of providing an educational videotape, 'Treatment Choices for Ischaemic Heart Disease: a Shared Decision-Making Program Videotape,' to patients referred for coronary angiography compared with standard patient-physician decision making (usual care). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Knowledge of coronary artery disease, satisfaction, self-reported physical and mental health functioning, and the proportion of patients who were referred for coronary revascularization. RESULTS: Compared with patients who received 'usual care,' those who received the videotape were more knowledgeable (mean score 83 vs. 58%; P < 0.0001) but less satisfied with their treatment (79 vs. 88%; P = 0.038). Before there is wide-spread dissemination of this technology, advocates should demonstrate its effectiveness in everyday practice.</s><s>Prenatal diagnosis (PND) is offered routinely as part of pregnancy care to a large number of women at increased risk of fetal anomalies. This study was a randomized trial that compared which counseling methods - individual, group, and use of a decision aid - are effective in PND counseling for women of advanced maternal age (>/=35 years) and their partners. Three hundred and fifty-two women and 225 partners completed pre- and post-intervention questionnaires assessing changes in knowledge, decisional conflict, state anxiety, satisfaction, use of PND, and pregnancy outcomes. All participants showed a significant increase in knowledge and a decrease in decisional conflict post intervention. Those in the group intervention showed a significantly greater increase in knowledge than those in the individual counseling intervention.</s><s>Much of the research on decision-making in health care has focused on consultation outcomes. Less is known about the process by which clinicians and patients come to a treatment decision. A ten-minute 'slice' of the consultation was sampled for detailed content analysis using existing interaction analysis protocols for verbal behaviour and ethological techniques for non-verbal behaviour. Median consultation times (quartiles) differed significantly depending on the technology used. Paper-based guidelines took 21 (19-26) minutes to work through compared to 31 (16-41) minutes for the implicit tool; and 44 (39-55) minutes for the explicit tool. In the ten minutes immediately preceding the decision point, GPs dominated the conversation, accounting for 64% (58-66%) of all utterances and this trend was similar across all three arms of the trial. These data suggest that decision aids may not lead to more 'sharing' in treatment decision-making and that, in their current form, they may take too long to negotiate for use in routine primary care.</s>"

        "Abstracts": "<s>A prospective, randomized, double-blind study on the effect of cephaloridine prophylaxis in the surgical management of appendicitis was performed. Both groups of patients were well matched with regard to age, sex, operative findings, and bacteria isolated at operation. Postoperative wound infections were detected in 11.6% of placebo-treated patients and in 1.4% of cephaloridine-treated patients (P less than .02).</s><s>A prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical study was performed to determined the efficacy of short-term (24 hr) perioperative antibiotics in preventing septic complications after emergency appendectomy for nonperforated appendicitis. The patients were stratified into three clinical arms: Group I (placebo, n = 45), Group II (cefamandole, n = 46) and Group III (cefamandole plus carbenicillin, n = 45). The three groups of patients were similar in regard to age, sex, duration of operation and pathologic classification of the appendix. No difference was observed between cefamandole alone and cefamandole plus carbenicillin. Systemic prophylactic antibiotics can successfully reduce septic complications after appendectomy for nonperforated appendicitis, and a single drug (cefamandole) directed at the facultative pathogens is as effective as double drug therapy, which includes specific anaerobic coverage.</s><s>544 children operated upon for uncomplicated appendicitis were randomised into three groups. The rate of infectious complications in Group I was 6.3% but only 2.1 and 2.3 in Groups II and III, respectively. However, in patients with gangrenous appendicitis the rate of postoperative infections was significantly lower in the two groups who received preoperative antibiotics (1.8% and 3.0% respectively) than in the group receiving no prophylactic antibiotics (infection rate 14%).</s><s>A series of 102 patients with presumptive acute appendicitis entered a prospective, randomized, clinical trial of intrarectal metronidazole given over a 48-h period commencing before surgery. A significant reduction in the incidence of anaerobic wound infection was observed in the treated group (P less than 0.02).</s><s>[Infection after appendectomy. Effect of preventive metronidazole therapy].</s><s>A series of 102 consecutive patients undergoing appendectomy through an incision in the right iliac fossa entered a prospective randomized trial to compare the effects of a 2 gram intravenous bolus dose of cefamandole with a control study. No differences occurred in the incidence of wound infection in the two groups.</s><s>Antibiotic prophylaxis against wound infection in emergency abdominal surgery.</s><s>The authors question the need to give prophylactic antibiotics perioperatively in all cases of acute appendicitis without perforation to reduce the rate of wound infection. A retrospective study of 82 patients showed a wound infection rate of 4.8%; 3 of 53 patients who did not receive antibiotics had a wound infection compared with 1 of 29 patients who received antibiotics. One of 21 patients who received the placebo had a wound infection; none of the 21 patients given cefamandole had infection.</s><s>Ninety-eight patients with suspected nonperforated acute appendicitis have to date been entered into a continuing, prospective, blinded randomized trial to determine the role of prophylactic metronidazole in postoperative wound infection. Thirty patients received 1 gm intravenous metronidazole preoperatively and five intravenous doses of 500 mg metronidazole postoperatively. Six of the 72 patients (8.2%) developed postoperative wound infections: four of 42 (9.5%) who received placebo and two of 30 (6.6%) who received metronidazole (P = 0.54 by Fisher exact test).</s><s>Post-appendicectomy sepsis still causes considerable morbidity and prolongs hospital stay. A large amount of recent work has gone into attempts to reduce such problems using various topical and systemic agents in differing regimes, with wide variation in their results. Antibiotics were given preoperatively with premedication and continued postoperatively for three days. The conclusion of this study is that a combination of an antibiotic aimed at aerobes (cefazolin or tobramycin) with another aiming at anaerobes (metronidazole) is the best prophylactic regime against post-appendicectomy sepsis.</s><s>A controlled trial of intraperitoneal noxytiolin (Noxiflex) solution in patients with peritonitis due to perforated appendicitis is reported.</s><s>In a randomized controlled trial of the use of a single intravenous dose of gentamicin sulfate and clindamycin phosphate used intraoperatively during emergency abdominal surgery, the overall incidence of postoperative wound infection was reduced from 32.3% to 10.4%. Significant reduction in wound infection occurred in the study group compared with control subjects irrespective of the underlying pathologic lesion.</s><s>One hundred patients undergoing appendicectomy through a right iliac fossa incision were randomized to receive normal saline or 500 mg metronidazole as an intravenous infusion during the operation. There were 13 wound infections (as defined by the discharge of pus), 12 (out of 51) in the saline group and 1 (out of 49) in the metronidazole group. were frequently cultured from the lumen of removed appendices and from pus obtained from infected wounds.</s><s>The frequency of non-clostridial anaerobic infection was studied in 95 patients who had undergone acute appendicectomy: 49 received prophylactic metronidazole and 46 received placebo. Anaerobic infection did not develop in any of the metronidazole-treated patients, but infections did develop in nine (19%) of the 46 controls.</s><s>A prospective placebo controlled randomized trial was carried out in 104 patients with a presumptive diagnosis of acute appendicitis. A single dose of 1 g of metronidazole was given intra-rectally 1 h preoperatively. There were 16 wound infections, 15 (out of 50) in the placebo group, 1 (out of 54) in the metronidazole group.</s><s>A total of 223 consecutive suspected appendicitis patients were treated preoperatively with parenteral tinidazole or physiological saline (control group). An infusion of 500 mg tinidazole was given to 110 patients over 30 minutes beginning about 30 minutes before the start of the operation, the control group comprised 111 patients.</s><s>The prophylactic use of a single dose of lincomycin in 100 patients undergoing appendicectomy reduced the incidence of postoperative wound infection from 17 to 6 per cent compared with a similar group of control patients. Bacteriological examination of the appendix area before surgery showed that Bacteroides fragilis and Escherichia coli were the organisms most frequently isolated. Systemic antibiotic therapy can successfully reduce the complications following appendicectomy but it is necessary to use a compound with activity against anaerobic organisms.</s><s>A total of 133 children, aged 16 months to 15 years (mean 6.7 years), with presumptive acute appendicitis, was included in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the short-term (72 hour) use of metronidazole suppositories as prophylaxis against post-operative infection.</s><s>A single intravenous dose of tobramycin and lincomycin, given at the start of gastrointestinal operations, significantly reduced the incidence of postoperative wound infection from 34% to 5%. Therapeutic concentrations of the antibiotics were maintained throughout the operative period in most cases.</s><s>In the course of two consecutive, double-blind and prospective studies, the authors evaluated the prophylactic effect of a single peroperative intravenous dose of gentamicin (this study included 166 patients) or the combination gentamicin and clindamycin (this study included 127 patients), on the wound infection rate following interventions involving the incision of an abdominal hollow viscus.</s><s>Prophylactic metronidazole was compared with no treatment in a randomly allocated study of patients undergoing appendicectomy. There were 4 hospital wound infections in the 87 patients receiving metronidazole and 11 out of 83 in the no-treatment group (P < 0.05). However, 60 per cent of wound infections occurred at home and the overall infection rates were not significantly different. Culture of the appendix showed aerobic organisms in 88 per cent of cases and anaerobes in 72 per cent. It is suggested that an antibiotic which is effective against both aerobic and anaerobic organisms might have an advantage over metronidazole in appendicitis.</s><s>Acute appendicitis continues as a medical challenge with newer approaches failing to improve diagnostic accuracy. The role of antibiotics in acute nonperforative appendicitis (NPA) remains unclear. In 175 patients studied at two hospitals, preoperative guidelines were used to exclude perforative appendicitis. Antibiotic prophylaxis in 122 patients with NPA was studied prospectively comparing ceftizoxime (CTZ), cefamandole (CFM), and placebo (PLA). Use of antibiotics (CTZ or CFM) resulted in decreased infections when compared with PLA (3 vs. 8; P less than .01) and fewer days of hospitalization (3.8 vs. 5.4 d, P less than .005).</s><s>[Metronidazole prophylaxis in appendectomy].</s><s>The 588 consecutive patients who were operated on on suspicion of appendicitis were randomized into three groups: the control group (no prophylaxis); the single-dose group (preoperatively 500 mg of tinidazole intravenously); and the 3-day group (in addition to the former, a 3-day tinidazole treatment). To discover any postoperative infectious complications, the patients' follow-up study was extended for at least 1 month. The 3-day tinidazole treatment, as compared with the single-dose prophylaxis, did not further improve the outcome.</s><s>In a prospective, block-randomized, multicenter study, the safety and efficacy of cefoxitin in preoperative prophylaxis were studied. 1735 patients undergoing appendectomy were evaluable, and half of these patients received 2 g of cefoxitin before undergoing operation. However, intra-abdominal abscess formation was not influenced by preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis.</s><s>Two hundred and fifty patients were admitted to a prospective randomized trial of single dosage prophylaxis against wound infection after appendicectomy. There were 12 exclusions, 72 patients received placebo, 81 received 600 mg i.m. In cases with a gangrenous or perforated appendix the infection rate in controls was 78 per cent; this was reduced to 44 per cent by a single dose of clindamycin. Cefazolin significantly reduced the number of aerobic organisms isolated from wound infections, but did not significantly reduce the incidence of wound infection.</s><s>A double-blind, randomized controlled trial was carried out in University Hospital, Kuala Lumpur to study the effect of metronidazole and cotrimoxazole on the incidence of wound infection following appendicectomy from November 1978 to January 1980. Patients were allocated at random into one of four groups: cotrimoxazole injection and placebo suppository, metronidazole suppository and cotrimoxazole injection, metronidazole suppository and placebo injection or placebo suppository and placebo injection.</s><s>In a prospective randomized double blind study, prophylactic cefamandol therapy was compared to placebos before appendectomy. The overall infection rate was reduced from 13,1% (1977/78) to 7,6% (1979/80). If there was a wound infection, the hospital stay of the treatment group was significantly reduced to the placebo group (p less than 0,0005).</s><s>Perforated appendicitis and antibiotics. A survey and a controlled clinical trial.</s><s>The efficacy of a single 500 mg intravenous intra-operative dose of metronidazole in the prevention of postoperative wound infection, following appendicectomy for acute mural appendicitis, was studied in a prospective randomized placebo controlled trial. Fourteen of the 96 patients (14.6%) in the metronidazole group and 13 of the 94 in the placebo group (13.8%) developed postoperative wound infection.</s><s>Prevention of postoperative wound infection after appendectomy by local application of tinidazole: a double-blind study.</s><s>The effects of intrarectal metronidazole and intraincisional povidone iodine on sepsis after emergency appendicectomy were compared in a double-blind randomised controlled trial in 496 patients. Wound sepsis occurred in 12.3% of metronidazole-treated patients compared with 24% in the povidone-iodine group and 23.5% in an untreated control group. The metronidazole-treated patients left hospital approximately 2 days earlier than patients in the other two groups. They returned to work sooner and receiver fewer visits from the district nursing service.</s><s>A prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical study was performed to determine the efficacy of perioperative systemic antibiotics in preventing infection after appendectomy for acute nonperforating appendicitis. The two groups were similar with regard to age distribution, sex ratio, duration of operation, pathologic condition of appendix, and hospital stay. Postoperative wound infections were detected in 9.6% of the placebo-treated patients, whereas none occurred in the cefoxitin group. Septic morbidity after appendectomy for nonperforating appendicitis is significantly reduced by systemic antibiotics, and brief administration of a single broad-spectrum agent (cefoxitin) is effective prophylaxis.</s><s>Single-dose intrarectal metronidazole prophylaxis against wound infection after appendectomy.</s><s>131 patients from 158 appendicectomies were randomly divided before the operation into two groups: a single intravenous dose of metronidazole, and a physiological saline placebo group. In the non-perforated cases the infection rates were 3.4% in the metronidazole and 7.9% in the placebo group. There was no statistically significant difference in the infection rates between the groups.</s><s>The effect of a preoperative single intravenous dose of metronidazole was studied in a prospective trial of 203 patients.</s><s>A prospective, randomized, clinical study was done to evaluate the place of prophylactic antibiotics in uncomplicated childhood appendicitis. One hundred patients with uncomplicated appendicitis were randomly assigned to one of four groups, each consisting of 25 cases. Group 2, group 3, and group 4 patients received ornidazole, penicillin plus tobramycin, and piperacillin, respectively. Although the need for antibiotic prophylaxis is well documented in adults, the rarity of infectious complications makes it highly questionable in the treatment of uncomplicated appendicitis in children.</s><s>A double blind, randomized, controlled trial was carried out at two hospitals to try the effect of metronidazole, which is effective against most anaerobes, and cefazolin, which is effective against many aerobic organisms, singly and in combination, on the incidence of wound sepsis following appendicectomy. Treatment was started before operation and continued eight-hourly for twenty-four hours. All patients in the trial were followed up at about two weeks after discharge from hospital and their wounds inspected. In those receiving both drugs the infection rate was 3%, a highly significant difference from that in the other three groups.</s>"

After 5 years, the primary, primary assisted and secondary patency rates were 36% (confidence interval (CI): 26-46%), 46% (CI: 36-56%) and 51% (CI: 41-61%) for ePTFE and 52% (CI: 42-62%) (p=0.04), 66% (CI: 56-76%) (p=0.01) and 70% (CI: 60-80%) (p=0.01) for Dacron, respectively. During prolonged follow-up (10 years), Dacron femoro-popliteal bypass grafts have superior patency compared to those of ePTFE grafts.</s><s>To compare long-term patency of Heparin-Bonded Dacron (HBD) and Human Umbilical Vein (HUV) vascular prostheses in above-knee femoro-popliteal bypass surgery. Patients were followed up every three months during the first postoperative year and yearly thereafter. Graft occlusions were detected by duplex scanning, angiography or surgical exploration. Overall secondary patency rates were 82%, 72% and 61% at 1, 3 and 5 years postoperatively. Smoking (p=0.019), number of patent crural arteries (p=0.030) and previous cerebro-vascular events (p=0.030) were significant predictors of graft occlusion. There was no difference in long-term graft performance between HUV and HBD for above knee infrainguinal bypass.</s><s>Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) (Gore-Tex) and human umbilical vein (Biograft) arterial grafts were compared for below-knee femoropopliteal bypass grafting in a prospective randomized clinical trial. Twenty-three limbs had three patent tibial arteries, 46 limbs had two tibial arteries, 31 limbs had one patent artery, and five limbs had isolated popliteal segments. During follow-up the incidence of PTFE failure was on the average 2.1 times higher than that of umbilical vein failure (95% confidence limits 1.2 to 3.4).</s><s>Despite many clinical studies, there is still uncertainty as to whether venous material is superior to polytetrafluoroethylene for femoropopliteal reconstruction proximal to the knee joint. Supported by early satisfactory results with thin-walled, stretched polytetrafluoroethylene for suprageniculate bypass grafts, a prospectively randomized clinical trial was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of reversed saphenous vein in comparison with that of polytetrafluoroethylene in above-knee arterial reconstruction. In a 3-year period, 151 above-knee femoropopliteal bypass graft operations were performed in 136 patients (77 male, 59 female). The indication for operation was severe claudication in 120 cases, rest pain in 20 cases, and ulceration in 11 cases. For the bypass graft, a reversed saphenous vein was used in each of 75 cases, and a polytetrafluoroethylene prosthesis was used in each of 76 cases. There was no hospital mortality; 5% of patients had minor postoperative complications.</s><s>To compare the patency of PTFE (Polytetrafluoroethylene) and unsealed knitted Dacron femoro-popliteal bypasses. Of 203 patients randomised, 194 were included in the final analysis (103 Dacron grafts and 91 PTFE grafts). Univariate comparisons of patency were made by the Kaplan-Meier method, multivariate calculations on the effects of covariables by a Cox regression analysis. 1.05-2.8]), impaired secondary patency was associated with infragenicular bypass (risk ratio 3.3 [C.I. 1.01-3.8]p=0.048), major amputation was independently predicted by below-knee bypass, tissue necrosis, and poor run-off index.</s><s>Some controversy exists as to whether polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is equivalent to reversed saphenous vein (SV) as bypass graft material for above-knee femoropopliteal revascularization. We compared the 5-year patency rate with reversed SV and PTFE grafts in patients with claudication who underwent bilateral above-knee femoropopliteal revascularization. Between January 1994 and December 1997, 51 patients (102 limbs) with bilateral disabling claudication due to superficial femoral artery occlusion underwent above-knee femoropopliteal bypass grafting, with SV in one limb and PTFE graft in the other limb. Patients were randomly selected for sequential surgical treatment with either SV-PTFE or PTFE-SV. In the SV group, three bypass grafts failed, requiring repeat operation in only one patient. There was no statistically significant difference in primary \"assisted\" patency rate for the two grafts: 100%, 98%, and 94% for SV grafts, and 96%, 84%, and 84% for PTFE grafts (P =.09), after 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively.</s><s>To compare polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) and polyester grafts (Dacron) for above knee femoropopliteal bypass. Age, gender, indication (claudication: 65%), run-off (2 or 3 vessels: 76%), diabetes (17%) and hypertension (31%) as well as cerebrovascular (9%) and cardiac (33%) risks were evenly distributed. Patency assessment was based on ankle-brachial pressures or imaging in case of doubt. At two years, patients treated for critical limb ischemia had a major amputation more often than patients operated on for intermittent claudication, 10 and 3 respectively (p=0.003), and had higher mortality rates, 20% and 8% respectively (p=0.001). This trial confirms that Dacron is at least as durable as PTFE for above-knee bypass procedures, and might even be superior.</s><s>Dacron was largely abandoned for femoropopliteal bypass 30 years ago, because better patency rates were achieved with saphenous vein. We compared heparin-bonded Dacron (HBD) with PTFE in a randomized multicenter clinical trial. Aspirin, 300 mg/d, was started before surgery, and was continued if tolerated. Primary patency rate, measured with Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, was 46% (95% confidence interval [CI], 35%-57%) at year 5 for HBD, compared with 35% for PTFE (CI, 25%-45%; P < .055). Secondary patency rate for HBD was 47% (CI, 36%-58%), and for PTFE was 36% (CI, 26%-46%). Limb salvage rate was 86% (CI, 77%-95%) and 74% (CI, 64%-84%), respectively. The incidence of major limb amputation, however, was significantly greater (P < .025) in the PTFE group compared with the HBD group at both 3 and 5 years of follow-up.</s><s>Despite many clinical studies, there is still uncertainty as to whether venous material is superior to prosthetic materials for femoropopliteal reconstruction proximal to the knee joint. A prospectively randomized clinical trial was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of reversed saphenous vein in comparison with that of collagen impregnated woven polyester prosthesis in above-knee arterial reconstruction. In a 3-year period, 103 above-knee femoropopliteal bypass graft operations were performed and followed in 85 patients (52 male, 33 female). The indication for operation was severe claudication in 74 cases, rest pain in 7 cases, and ulceration in 4 cases. There was no hospital mortality; 5% of patients had minor postoperative complications. During this follow-up period of 2 years, we found no statistically significant difference in primary and secondary patency between saphenous vein and collagen impregnated woven polyester prosthesis.</s><s>The aim was to examine the effect of a Miller vein cuff at the distal anastomosis on the medium- to long-term patency and limb salvage rates of femoral to above-knee and femoral to below-knee popliteal artery polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) bypasses. This study involved extended follow-up of the original cohort of patients included in a previously reported multicentre randomized clinical study. For this study, full data were available on 235 (120 with a Miller cuff, 115 without). The cumulative 5-year patency rate for above-knee bypasses with a Miller cuff was 40 per cent, compared with 42 per cent for non-cuffed bypasses (P = 0.702). Miller cuffs had no effect on patency rates for femoral to above-knee popliteal bypasses at 5 years and did not improve limb salvage in either group.</s>"

Participants included 628 women newly diagnosed with breast cancer and 40 oncologists from six cancer centers in Canada. Audiotape benefit was not significantly related to patient satisfaction with communication, mood state, or quality of life at 12 weeks postconsultation, and was not significantly affected by choice of receiving the audiotape. Audiotape provision benefits patients by facilitating their perception of being informed about treatment side effects, but does not significantly influence patient satisfaction with communication, mood state, or quality of life.</s><s>This paper describes a pilot study of information giving in an oncology setting. This was achieved by randomly allocating patients to having their consultation tape-recorded or not. The results suggest that this approach increases the retention of information in patients as well as reducing their levels of anxiety.</s><s>Communication between physicians and advanced cancer patients is frequently difficult. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact on patients' recall of and overall satisfaction with their consultation by the addition of an audiocassette recording of a consultation to written recommendations. The addition of an audiocassette recording of an outpatient consultation to written recommendations for patients with advanced cancer is capable of increasing both the overall patient recall of the visit and satisfaction with the outpatient clinical setting.</s><s>Studies of tape recordings of cancer consultations have produced conflicting results. Patients (n = 142) were randomized to receive (1) an audiotape of their consultation, (2) an audiotape describing cancer in general terms, or (3) no tape. Recall of information was assessed in a structured interview 4 to 20 days after the consultation. Satisfaction with the consultation increased linearly from no tape to general tape to consultation tape. Average recall for all groups was 6.4 of the 25 items of information presented, and 2.4 of the six points identified as particularly important by the oncologist.</s><s>By means of a randomized double-blind study, the effect of providing taped initial consultations on cancer patients' satisfaction, recall, and quality of life was investigated. Consecutive cancer patients referred to either the gynecology or medical oncology outpatient clinic were eligible. Patients were either provided with the tape (experimental group) or not (control group). Baseline variables included sociodemographics, preferences for information, coping styles, and clinical characteristics. This intervention enhances their satisfaction and improves their recall of information. Tapes seem more helpful in enhancing satisfaction in younger patients and recall of diagnostic information in older patients.</s><s>The purpose of this study was to explore the hypothesis that assisting men with prostate cancer to obtain information would enable them to assume a more active role in treatment decision making and decrease their levels of anxiety and depression. Respondents were recruited from one community urology clinic in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Sixty newly diagnosed men were randomly assigned to receive either a self-efficacy information intervention that consisted of a written information package with discussion, a list of questions they could ask their physician, and an audiotape of the medical consultation (n = 30), or a written information package alone (n = 30). This group of older men do want to be informed and participate in medical decisions.</s><s>To present the results of a pilot study testing an intervention designed to improve the quality of medical consultations between breast cancer patients and physicians and, in particular, to report the effects of the intervention on the quality of treatment decisions, the quality of communication, and the satisfaction of patients and physicians. We enrolled 24 predominantly white, well-educated, early-stage breast cancer patients who were facing local or systemic treatment decisions in a sequential, controlled trial. All patients received a visit preparation session before the consultation in which a trained researcher helped patients organize their questions and concerns. Valid and reliable surveys measured the quality of treatment decisions and satisfaction with the consultation. Consultation recording methods provide a promising innovation for medical consultations.</s><s>This study examined the effect of providing patients with an audiotape of a previous consultation on their level of participation during a subsequent consultation. A content analysis revealed no significant differences between tape and control group in the mean number of questions asked during the second consultation. A larger number of control group patients (61%) made at least one request for facts already provided in their first consultation compared to tape group patients (39%) (P = 0.05). Audiotapes appear to facilitate patients' requests for the clarification of previously given information and permit the re-absorption of complex information given when patients may have been too distressed for it to be assimilated.</s><s>The purpose of this study was to systematically compare two audiotape formats for the delivery of information relevant to informed consent to participate in a clinical trial in breast oncology, and to establish the feasibility of adding a consultation recording protocol to a clinical treatment trial. Participants were 69 women with newly diagnosed breast cancer and 21 oncologists from 5 Canadian cancer centers. Patients received their tapes immediately following the clinical trial consultation.

Patients receiving the consultation audiotape reported having been provided with significantly more disease and treatment information in general (p=0.04), and more information about treatment alternatives (p=0.04) and treatment side effects (p=0.01) in particular, than patients who did not receive the audiotape. Patients rated the audiotape intervention positively, with an average score of 83.0 out of 100.</s><s>Despite reports of poor patient understanding and recall after cancer consultations, few doctors provide communication aids.

        "Abstracts": "<s>There is an ongoing debate about the preferred technique for inguinal hernia repair. Some 280 men with a primary hernia were randomized prospectively to undergo Shouldice, tension-free Lichtenstein or laparoscopic TAPP repair. Patients were examined after 52 months to assess hernia recurrence, nerve damage, testicular atrophy and patient satisfaction. All recurrences after tension-free repairs were diagnosed within the first year after surgery. Nerve injuries were significantly more frequent after open Shouldice and Lichtenstein repairs.</s><s>Shouldice repair for primary inguinal hernia is reported to have better results than classic Bassini-type repairs. This double randomized controlled trial compared high ligation and ring narrowing with Bassini-Stetten repair for the indirect inguinal hernia with a firm posterior wall, and Shouldice with Bassini-Stetten repair for the inguinal hernia with a weakened posterior wall, direct or indirect. By 1995, 89 patients with 100 hernia repairs had died, and for 30 repairs the patients could not be located. Of the remaining 194 hernia repairs, followup was updated by physical examination in 179 (92%) and by telephone interview in 15 (8%). Seventy-three percent of the recurrences happened > 2 years after the operation.</s><s>Shouldice's repair (SR) and Moloney's darn repair (DR) are commonly practised repairs for hernias in the young age group with acceptably low recurrence rates. The SR is considered technically challenging and difficult, while the DR is gaining popularity in recent years. To compare these techniques a total of 50 cases (age group 18-40 years) were randomised to two groups (SR 25, DR 25). Both groups were studied with respect to operative time; postoperative pain at 6,12 and 24 hours (evaluated by pain scale 1-10) need for analgesia, ambulation (evaluated by a four-point scale), complications and return to work. The SR required a longer time (average 81 minutes) compared to DR (average 43 minutes).</s><s>A randomized controlled trial was conducted on 142 adult male and female patients for primary inguinal hernias by the Shouldice or the Bassini-Kirschner surgical technique. At two years follow-up examination nine recurrences out of 63 patients having had Bassini-Kirschner's operation and seven recurrences out of 65 patients having had Shouldice's operation were found (p = 0.792, NS). Both operations gave the same results when performed by either a consultant surgeon or a surgeon in training.</s><s>The authors conducted a prospective randomized trial to compare the Shouldice and the Bassini-Kirschner technique between April, 1994 and December, 1995. 63 Shouldice and 66 Bassini-Kirschner operations were performed by 17 surgeons. The duration of surgery, the technique of anesthesia, the perioperative complications, the duration of postoperative care, then one year after the operation the recurrence rate and the patient's subjective complains were investigated. The authors could not find significant difference in the results of the two types of surgery although they were well experienced with the Bassini-Kirschner operation and just starting to practice the Shouldice procedure. These facts suggest that having more experience with the Shouldice operation makes available the extreme low recurrence rate published by several authors.</s><s>The lowest recurrence rates after inguinal hernia repair have been achieved by specialized hernia clinics. Fourteen surgeons in training not familiar with Shouldice repair received constant supervision for six repairs before independent operation. There were a similar number of sliding hernias in the Shouldice repair (14) and plication darn (20) groups. The recurrences suggest that additional supervision of junior surgeons is required during the Shouldice repair learning period.</s><s>The aim of the present randomized trial was to compare the Shouldice procedure and the Lichtenstein hernia repair with respect to recurrence rate, technical difficulty, convalescence and chronic pain. A further aim was to determine to what extent general surgeons in routine surgical practice were able to reproduce the excellent results reported from specialist hernia centres. Three hundred patients with primary inguinal hernia were randomized to either a Shouldice repair or to a tension-free Lichtenstein repair. It was characterized as mild or moderate in all except two patients who had the Shouldice operation. It was possible to achieve excellent results with this technique in a general surgical unit.</s><s>The main hypotheses were that the Lichtenstein inguinal hernia repair has a lower recurrence rate and similar incidence of chronic groin pain compared to sutured repairs when performed by surgical trainees. First- and second-year residents, under the supervision of an experienced general surgeon, performed the procedure. More information is needed on long-term groin pain following anterior mesh repair.</s><s>Between 1986 and 1992, 265 men of mean age 51 (range 16-75) years with a primary inguinal hernia were randomized to undergo surgery by staff surgeon or surgical resident and further randomized to receive a modified Bassini operation (transversalis fascia not divided but included in the repair) or Shouldice procedure. Recurrence developed in 12 of 125 patients with a Bassini procedure and two of 119 after a Shouldice repair (9.6 versus 1.7 per cent, P = 0.006). Multivariate analysis identified the presence of a direct hernia (P = 0.003) as the additional main factor for the development of recurrence.</s><s>Retrospective analyses have shown that long-term recurrence rates after Lichtenstein mesh and Shouldice herniorrhaphies are low. Postoperative pain, narcotic use, and time to resumption of usual activities and employment were recorded. Patients were blinded to the type of repair received until all data were collected. By 3 days after operation, 50% of patients rated their pain as very mild or less and no longer required narcotic analgesics. Patients in both groups returned to usual activity and work by a median of 9 days after operation. Both of these well-established methods can be used to repair inguinal hernias with local anesthetics in an outpatient setting with minimal morbidity.</s><s>Although tension-free techniques of hernia repair using synthetic meshes revealed encouraging results, the best method of inguinal hernia repair is still unclear. In a prospective randomized phase-II-B study, early postoperative results of laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal repair (n = 80), open plug and patch repair (n = 80), and Shouldice's operation (n = 80) were compared. Main postoperative complications were wound hematomas, seromas, and superficial wound infection, without significant difference between the groups.</s><s>To compare the outcome following Lichtenstein open mesh technique or Shouldice repair for inguinal hernia operated on by surgeons in training. Patients in the mesh group took significantly less sick leave (mean 18.2 days) than those in the Shouldice group (23.8 days, p<0.05). The number of recurrences differed significantly between the groups with 9 in the Shouldice group and none in the mesh group (p<0.01). For surgeons in training the Lichtenstein open mesh technique is a better method of inguinal hernia repair than the Shouldice technique.</s><s>Hernia repair is the second most frequently performed operation in France and in the United States, the prevalence being 36 for every 1000 males. Between 1983 and 1989, 1578 adult males with a total of 1706 nonrecurrent inguinal hernias were prospectively and randomly allotted to undergo either a Bassini's repair, Cooper's ligament, or Shouldice repair with polypropylene or a Shouldice repair with stainless steel for determination of which technique was associated with the lowest recurrence rate. Of the 1647 remaining hernias, 52.2% were indirect, 25.6% were direct, and 23.2% were combined. This difference remained significant even when the maximal bias test was used.</s><s>The original Bassini and Shouldice methods for inguinal herniorrhaphy were tested against each other and against their respective variants that avoid permanent suturing of the internal oblique muscle. Outcome was correlated to prospectively defined types and risk factors such as direct hernia, repair for recurrent hernia, hernial sac diameter greater than 8 cm, age greater than 70 years, overweight, and chronic bronchitis. Local complications exclusive of recurrence, but including the redoubtable and litigious sequelae of testicular atrophy and chronic ilioinguinal pain, were significantly reduced from 6.3% (group B and C) to 2.3% by omitting permanent muscle sutures (groups A and D; P < 0.05). However, the use of slowly absorbable suture material resulted in a disproportionately high recurrence rate of 12.8% in the modified Bassini group A. The Shouldice technique is superior to and more than merely a reinvention of Bassini's original method. The omission of muscle sutures is physiologically sound and recommended for the Shouldice operation.</s><s>To compare the Lichtenstein, tension-free mesh, and the Shouldice, 4-layer Bassini repair of the inguinal hernia. Slightly modified Shouldice and Lichtenstein repairs were used to repair primary and recurrent inguinal hernias. A total of 717 repairs in 672 patients, including 45 bilateral repairs, have been monitored to date. Twelve superficial infections associated with Shouldice and 6 associated with mesh repairs were found.</s>"

This study is undertaken in order to find out (a) whether increasing the dose of nebulized furosemide from 1 to 2 mg/kg of body weight will further improve the pulmonary mechanics in premature infants with evolving chronic lung disease and (b) whether the effects of a single dose of nebulized furosemide last beyond 2 hours. Furosemide was administered by nebulization at doses of 1 and 2 mg/kg of body weight, in random order, on two separate days 24 hours apart. Pulmonary function studies were performed before and 2, 4, and 6 hours after the nebulization. Urine was collected for 6 hours immediately before and for 6 hours after the nebulization. Furosemide by nebulization at 1 and 2 mg/kg of body weight resulted in significant improvement in tidal volume and compliance. Increasing the dose from 1 to 2 mg/kg of body weight results in no further improvement in the pulmonary function.</s><s>To compare the effects of a single dose of frusemide administered either intravenously or by nebulisation on pulmonary mechanics in premature infants with evolving chronic lung disease. Frusemide (1 mg/kg/body weight) was administered, in random order, intravenously and by nebulisation, on two separate occasions 24 hours apart. Pulmonary function studies were performed before and at 30, 60, and 120 minutes after administration of frusemide. Urine was collected for six hours immediately before and for six hours after administration of frusemide. Nebulised frusemide increased the tidal volume 31 (SE 11.5)% and compliance 34 (SE 12)% after two hours, whereas no change in either was noted for up to two hours after intravenous frusemide administration. Single dose nebulised frusemide improves pulmonary function in premature infants with evolving chronic lung disease without adverse effects on fluid and electrolyte balance.</s>"

Three concentrations of tretinoin (0.05%, 0.01%, and 0.001%) in a new emollient cream formulation were compared with vehicle in a 24-week, double-blind, randomized, multicenter study of 296 subjects with photodamaged facial skin. Tretinoin emollient cream 0.05% gave a significantly better global response to therapy than vehicle (p less than 0.001), with 68% of subjects exhibiting improvement at the end of therapy, compared with 43% of subjects in the vehicle group. An excellent or good response was found in 26% of subjects treated with tretinoin emollient cream 0.05% versus 11% of vehicle-treated subjects. Fine wrinkling, mottled hyperpigmentation, and roughness were more improved in subjects who received tretinoin emollient cream 0.05% than in vehicle-treated subjects (p less than 0.05). Tretinoin emollient cream 0.05% appears to be safe and effective in the treatment of photodamaged skin.</s><s>Tazarotene, a potent acetylenic retinoid for topical use, might be expected to benefit photodamaged skin, including improving the classical signs of fine wrinkles, mottled hyperpigmentation, and roughness. Ten healthy female volunteers, aged 45 to 65 years, with moderately photodamaged forearm skin applied tazarotene 0.1% gel to one arm and vehicle gel to the other once daily for 12 weeks. In this 12-week pilot study tazarotene redressed abnormalities associated with photo-damaged skin.</s><s>A multicentre clinical trial has been conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of tretinoin 0.05% cream (Retin-A) in the treatment of photo-damaged Australian skin. Changes in clinical signs of photodamage and parameters of cutaneous irritation were assessed by investigators using a 7 point scale, whilst changes in signs of photodamage were rated by subjects using a 5 point scale. Changes in skin biopsies and silicone skin surface replicas were also assessed. Histological findings included a significant increase in mean epidermal thickness. Significant topographical changes were not detected in skin surface replica sets. Cutaneous irritation, the most common side effect, was usually mild and transient. We conclude that tretinoin 0.05% cream significantly improved the appearance of photo-damaged skin.</s><s>Tretinoin emollient cream 0.01% was used to treat 40 patients with photoaged skin of the face and forearms in a 48-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Tretinoin-treated forearms showed significantly greater improvement in roughness, mottled hyperpigmentation, fine wrinkling, and lentigines at 24 and 48 weeks. No significant difference in reported adverse experiences was found between forearms in both treatment groups. Tretinoin 0.01% was generally well tolerated, and skin irritation was minimal.</s><s>Laser resurfacing of facial rhytids has become a popular treatment option for many patients with wrinkles, photoaging, and acne scarring. Laser wavelength options and optimization of techniques continue to evolve in an attempt to shorten the healing phase associated with laser skin resurfacing. Forty treatment sites on 20 patients were randomized and evaluated following treatment of the upper lip region with a combination of CO2 laser resurfacing alone or with the same CO2 laser treatment followed by 3 passes with the Er:YAG laser. Patient diaries were maintained to assess erythema, crusting, pain, itching, swelling, pigmentary changes, and the day of first make-up application. Chromometer measurements of erythema were also analyzed and percentage moisture recorded. On average, patients were able to apply make-up 5.5 days postoperatively, regardless of which procedure used. Chromometer measurements noted no significant difference between techniques in the rate of resolution of erythema. Blinded objective grading revealed that crusting was reduced on average from 7.2 to 6.0 days, and swelling was reduced from 6.3 to 6.0 days in patients receiving the combined procedure. Medium to deep (Grade III) facial rhytids were improved by 70% with both procedures with no significant difference noted between techniques.</s><s>To directly compare the cosmetic outcome and adverse effects of dermabrasion and superpulsed carbon dioxide laser for the treatment of perioral rhytides. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive treatment with carbon dioxide laser resurfacing to one side of the perioral area and dermabrasion to the other side in a prospective, comparative clinical study. Fifteen healthy fair-skinned volunteers with moderate to severe perioral rhytides and no history of prior cosmetic surgical procedures to the same anatomic area. Paired t tests were used for statistical comparisons of the 2 resurfacing methods. The difference in rhytide scores for the 2 methods was not statistically significant (P= .35) at 4 months. Both dermabrasion and carbon dioxide laser resurfacing are effective in the treatment of perioral rhytides.</s><s>In a 16-week randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study of topical tretinoin in the treatment of photoaging, all patients applied topical tretinoin to one forearm and vehicle cream to the other. Half of the patients received tretinoin to the face, and half received vehicle cream. All 30 patients who completed the study showed statistically significant improvement in photoaging on the tretinoin-treated forearms, but not on the vehicle-treated forearms.</s><s>To compare the efficacy, adverse effects, and histological findings of erbium:YAG (Er:YAG) and carbon dioxide (CO2) laser treatment in removing facial rhytides. The end points of the study were wrinkle improvement and duration of adverse effects. In all subjects, 1 side of the face was treated with a CO2 laser and other side with an Er:YAG laser. Observations were recorded by subjects, investigators, and a blinded panel of experts. However, in subjects receiving more than 5 passes of Er:YAG laser, improvement scores were not significantly different from those for 2 to 3 passes of CO2 laser treatment. Posttreatment erythema was noted at 2 weeks in 14 subjects (67%) on the Er:YAG laser-treated side and 20 subjects (95%) on the CO2 laser-treated side. Subjects treated with Er:YAG laser recover more quickly from the procedure than those receiving CO2 laser treatment.</s><s>High-energy pulsed or computer-scanned continuous-wave carbon dioxide (CO2) laser resurfacing has gained popularity as a wrinkle treatment because of its minimal thermal injury and precise control of tissue vaporization depth. Manual tumescent dermabrasion has also been effective for treating facial wrinkles. This is, to our knowledge, the first study comparing the use of CO2 laser to manual tumescent dermabrasion for the treatment of wrinkles on the upper lip. The average upper lip laser-treated wrinkle score (0 = none to 5 = severe) decreased from 4.3 +/- 0.2 before treatment to 1.8 +/- 0.3 at 6 months after treatment.</s><s>Glycolic acid has been one of the more commonly used alpha hydroxy acids for the treatment of photodamaged skin. Its value as a quick \"skin refreshing\" peeling agent has been widely touted. To assess the potential value of glycolic acid-based refresher peels as a cosmetic procedure. In addition to the \"peels,\" six subjects were randomized to a 10% glycolic acid-based moisturizer twice daily. Patients were evaluated monthly and graded on a clinical scale using objective measures.</s><s>Low-strength daily formulations of glycolic acid are widely promoted for the treatment of photoaging. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a 5% unneutralized formulation of glycolic acid in the treatment of facial and neck photoaging. Seventy-five volunteers were recruited to take part in this double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical study. Participants applied either the 5% glycolic acid cream or the placebo cream to the face and neck for a period of 3 months. Overall there were trends towards greater improvement or less worsening in the glycolic acid group for all clinical assessments for photoaging. Unneutralized 5% glycolic acid topical cream when used on a regular daily basis can improve some photoaging effects.</s><s>To assess the safety and efficacy of 4 concentrations of tazarotene cream in the treatment of facial photodamage. Daily topical application of tazarotene cream (0.01%, 0.025%, 0.05%, and 0.1%) compared with its vehicle and with 0.05% tretinoin emollient cream. Tazarotene in a cream formulation is safe and is associated with positive changes in the treatment of photodamaged facial skin.</s><s>Vivida when used orally has been previously shown to be effective in treating degenerated skin of women. Vivida was significantly (P < 0.001) more effective than placebo in improving wrinkles. Scanner measurement showed that epidermal thickness increased from 0.13 mm to 0.29 mm and dermal thickness from 0.91 mm to 1.29 mm on the Vivida-treated side; only minimal changes were observed on the placebo-treated side. The elasticity index increased from about 50% to 69% on the Vivida-treated side and from 49% to 50% on the placebo-treated side.</s><s>The CO2 laser is normally described as an aggressive resurfacing tool, whereas the erbium:YAG laser has enjoyed a reputation as the ideal tool for superficial resurfacing. The implication from many studies is that the CO2 laser is incapable of \"minimally invasive\" resurfacing. One side was treated with a pulsed CO2 laser and the other with an Er:YAG laser. Postauricular skin was treated in an identical fashion to the study sites and biopsied for microscopic analysis. The biopsies were obtained before treatment, immediately after treatment, and either 3 or 6 months after treatment to evaluate the acute level of injury and subsequent degree of fibroplasia. Photographs were taken at baseline, immediately after treatment, 1, 2, and 6 weeks, and 3 and 6 months after treatment. There was less erythema at the CO2 laser-treated sites 2 weeks after treatment; the differences had resolved by 6 weeks after treatment. When CO2 and Er:YAG lasers are used in a manner such that there are equivalent immediate postoperative histologic results, equivalent healing and cosmetic improvement occurs. One can use CO2 laser with one pass to mimic a moderately aggressive Er:YAG laser treatment.</s><s>The efficacy of topical tretinoin (all-trans-retinoic acid) in treating photoaging is well established. Questions that remain are (1) whether irritation causes all or part of the improvement; (2) the concentration of tretinoin that maximizes clinical response with minimal side effects; and (3) the effects of long-term treatment on components of the cutaneous immune system. Both 0.1% and 0.025% tretinoin produced statistically significant overall improvement in photoaging of the face compared with vehicle; there were no clinically or statistically significant differences in efficacy between the two concentrations of tretinoin. After 48 weeks, 0.1% and 0.025% tretinoin produced similar statistically significant epidermal thickening (by 30% and 28%, respectively) compared with vehicle (11% decrease) and increased vascularity (by 100% and 89%, respectively) compared with vehicle (9% decrease). No significant changes occurred in any immunologic markers when tretinoin and vehicle treatments were compared. The separation between clinical improvement and irritation suggests that mechanisms other than irritation dominate tretinoin-induced repair of photoaging in humans.</s><s>The hyperpigmented lesions commonly called liver spots distress patients, in part because such lesions are associated with aging. We investigated their treatment with topical 0.1 percent tretinoin (retinoic acid). Fifty-eight patients completed a 10-month randomized, double-blind study in which they applied either 0.1 percent tretinoin (n = 28) or vehicle (n = 30) cream daily to the face, upper extremities, or both. After one month of treatment the patients treated with tretinoin had significant lightening of hyperpigmented lesions as compared with the patients who received vehicle (P less than 0.002). Reductions in epidermal pigmentation evident on histologic analysis were significantly correlated with the degree of clinical lightening of lesions (r = -0.53, P less than 0.0001). Topical 0.1 percent tretinoin significantly improves both clinical and microscopical manifestations of liver spots; these lesions do not return for at least six months after therapy is discontinued.</s><s>Laser resurfacing of facial rhytides has become a popular treatment option for many patients with wrinkles, photoaging, and acne scarring. Variable pulse erbium:YAG (Er:YAG) laser systems are now available that offer the surgeon the ability to vary the Er:YAG pulse duration from a pulse that is primarily ablative to one that is more thermal. Forty-two treatment sites on 21 patients were randomized and evaluated after treatment of the upper lip region with CO(2) laser resurfacing on one side and a variable pulse Er:YAG laser on the other. Patient diaries were maintained to assess erythema, crusting, pain, and pigmentary changes. The variable pulse Er:YAG laser treatment reduced the duration of crusting on average from 7.7 days with CO(2) to 3.4 days. No cases of permanent hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation, or scarring occurred. The protocol used in this study approaches but does not equal the results we have traditionally seen with CO(2) laser resurfacing.</s><s>The clinical and histologic effects of a new emollient cream formulation of topical tretinoin at concentrations of 0.05% and 0.01% were examined in 251 subjects with mild to moderate photodamaged facial skin in a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, multicenter study. Side effects of erythema, peeling, and stinging were usually mild and well tolerated.</s><s>Evidence is accumulating that cartilage polysaccharides derived from marine fish have a repairing effect on solar elastosis. In a double-blind trial, the efficacy and safety of two commercial preparations, Vivida and Imedeen, were compared in the treatment of sun-damaged skin in women aged 40-60 years. In the Vivida group, mean epidermal thickness increased from 0.14 to 0.26 mm, dermal thickness from 0.90 to 1.51 mm and the elasticity index from 47% to 71%. After 90 days, the differences between the two groups for all three parameters were statistically significant (P less than 0.001).</s><s>In the present double-blind investigation, the effects of a new formulation of natural cartilage polysaccharides on sundamaged skin were studied in women aged 40-60 years. No changes were observed in the placebo group and no adverse effects were reported by either treatment group.</s><s>To determine the efficacy of topical ascorbic acid application in treating mild to moderate photodamage of facial skin using an objective, computer-assisted image analysis of skin surface topography and subjective clinical, photographic, and patient self-appraisal questionnaires. Nineteen evaluable volunteer sample patients aged between 36 and 72 years with Fitzpatrick skin types I, II, and III who were in good physical and mental health with mild to moderately photodamaged facial skin were considered for analysis. Treatment assignments were not disclosed to subjects, clinicians, or personnel involved in analyzing skin replicas. Overall investigator scores were compared with baseline and graded as excellent (much improved), good (improved), fair (slightly improved), no change, or worse. Optical profilometry analysis was performed on the skin surface replicas of the lateral canthal (crow's feet) region, comparing baseline to end-of-study specimens. Using this computer-based system, the resulting image was digitally analyzed, and numeric values were assigned to reflect surface features. These values provided objective data that document pretreatment and posttreatment texture changes proportional to the degree of wrinkling, roughness, and other surface irregularities. Patient questionnaire results demonstrated statistically significant improvement overall, active treatment 84.2% greater than control. Photographic assessment demonstrated significant improvement, active treatment 57.9% greater than control.</s><s>In extensive clinical studies and practical use since its US Food and Drug Administration approval in 1995, tretinoin emollient cream 0.05% has been shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of fine facial wrinkles, mottled hyperpigmentation, and skin roughness. Results indicate statistically significant improvement in fine wrinkling, coarse wrinkling, and yellowing with the use of tretinoin cream 0.02% at week-24 end point, compared with placebo. Therapy with tretinoin cream 0.02% was well tolerated overall and demonstrated a favorable safety profile.</s><s>Photodamaged skin occurs as a result of long-term exposure to ultraviolet radiation. The incidence of photodamage in European and North American populations with Fitzpatrick skin types I, II, and III is estimated at 80% to 90%. Patients applied either 0.1% isotretinoin or matching vehicle cream to the face, forearms, and hands once nightly for 36 weeks. Treatment response increased throughout the 36-week treatment period and the overall appearance of photodamaged skin was significantly better than with the vehicle alone.</s><s>To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of 2 widely used topical alpha-hydroxy acids at low concentrations, 8% glycolic acid and 8% lactic (L-isoform) acid creams, in the treatment of photodamaged skin. A single-center, 22-week, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, randomized clinical trial assessed the overall severity of photodamage on the faces and forearms of volunteers, based on 7 individual clinical components of cutaneous photodamage. Seventy-four women, aged 40 to 70 years, with moderately severe photodamaged facial skin were enrolled in the study. One subject withdrew from the study early because of skin irritation, and 6 subjects withdrew from the study for personal reasons. Improvement in alpha-hydroxy acid-treated photodamaged skin as determined by patient self-assessments and physician evaluations of efficacy and irritancy. L-Lactic acid cream was significantly superior to the vehicle in reducing the overall severity of photodamage (P < .05), mottled hyperpigmentation (P < .05), sallowness (P < .05), and roughness on the forearms (P < .05) at week 22.</s><s>The high energy, pulsed, or computer-scanned continuous wave carbon dioxide laser (CO2 laser) has gained popularity as a wrinkle treatment because of its minimal thermal injury and precise control of tissue vaporization depth. Chemical peels such as phenol have also been effective in treating facial wrinkles. This is, to our knowledge, the first study comparing the use of CO2 laser to phenol for treatment of wrinkles on the upper lip. To compare the effectiveness and side effect profile of the 950 microsec dwell time CO2 laser to that of unoccluded Baker's phenol chemical peel in the treatment of upper lip wrinkles.</s><s>Facial skin treatments with laser resurfacing, dermabrasion, and chemical peels were responsible for a significant portion of the 2.7 million cosmetic procedures performed in 1998. Perioral wrinkles are a common problem for which plastic surgical consultation is obtained. The aim of this study was to compare and quantify the advantages and disadvantages of laser resurfacing versus dermabrasion in the treatment of perioral wrinkles. Twenty female patients provided informed consent and participated in the study. Half of the perioral area was treated with dermabrasion and half was treated with the UltraPulse CO2 laser. Photographs were evaluated by 10 board-certified plastic surgeons who were blinded to the treatment methods. Patient preference was inferred from the resurfacing method that they would recommend to a friend.</s>"

The primary outcome variable was the time taken to attain full enteral feedings of at least 130 mL/kg/d. The mean time to attain full enteral feedings after enrollment was 24.9 + 2.9 days in the erythromycin group and 30.8 +/- 4.1 days in the placebo group, a difference that did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.17). Low-dose erythromycin did not reduce the time taken to attain full enteral feedings in preterm infants with very low birth weight and feeding intolerance. Gastroesophageal reflux decreased as a consequence of maturation of the gastrointestinal tract and not because of erythromycin. These preliminary results justify verification in larger multicenter trials.</s><s>To determine the effect of erythromycin on the establishment of enteral feeding in ventilated infants < 31 weeks gestation. There were no significant differences between the groups for any of the outcomes. The infants treated with erythromycin reached full feeding at a median (quartile) age of 8 (5-12) days compared with 9 (6-14) days for controls. Intravenous erythromycin in antimicrobial doses is unlikely to benefit the introduction of feeding in preterm infants.</s><s>Approximately half of extremely low birth weight infants have feeding intolerance, which delays their achievement of full enteral feedings. Few studies have assessed the efficacy of this drug in preterm infants with established feeding intolerance. In a controlled, randomized, double-blinded clinical trial, infants received intragastric erythromycin or placebo for 8 days without crossover. At study entry, the authors recorded motor activity in the antrum and the duodenum during fasting, in response to intragastric erythromycin (1.5 mg/kg) or placebo, and in response to feeding. Gastric emptying at 20 minutes and transit time from duodenum to anus were determined. Intragastric erythromycin does not improve feeding tolerance in preterm infants with established feeding intolerance because it fails to improve gastrointestinal function in the short or long term.</s><s>To determine the efficacy and safety of oral erythromycin (EM) for feeding intolerance in preterm infants < 35 weeks gestation. Each group comprised 23 preterm infants, almost all of whom were < 32 weeks gestation. Times to full feeding were significantly shorter and the number of withheld feeds were significantly less in the EM group than the control group; the respective medians (interquartile ranges) were 7 days (6 to 9 days) versus 13 days (9 to 15 days) (P < .001) and 1 episode (0 to 2 episodes) versus 9 episodes (2 to 13 episodes) (P < .001). No significant differences in episodes of sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, and cholestasis were observed.</s><s>Efficacy of oral, prophylactic erythromycin in reducing the time to establish full enteral feeds (150 ml/kg/day) was assessed in neonates < 32 weeks, ready for enteral feeds. The median gestational age, birth weight and postnatal age at start of feeds were 29 versus 30 weeks (p = 0.40), 1232 versus 1280 g (p = 0.96) and 5 versus 5 days (p = 0.84) for erythromycin and placebo group, respectively.

A prospective, double blind, randomised, placebo controlled study in a tertiary referral centre of a university teaching hospital was conducted on 56 preterm infants (< 1500 g) consecutively admitted to the neonatal unit. Potential adverse effects of oral erythromycin and complications associated with parenteral nutrition were assessed as secondary outcomes. Twenty seven and 29 infants received oral erythromycin and placebo solution respectively. The times taken to establish half, three quarters, and full enteral feeding after the drug treatment were significantly shorter in the group receiving oral erythromycin than in those receiving the placebo (p < 0.05, p < 0.05 and p < 0.0001 respectively).

Antihistamine-decongestant therapy reduced postnasal drip and significantly decreased the severity of cough, nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, and throat-clearing during the first few days of the common cold. In addition, cough was 20 to 30% less prevalent in the active drug group within 3 days of starting therapy.</s><s>Tape recorder for evaluation of coughs in children.</s><s>[Secure therapeutic effectiveness of the traditional antitussive agent Mintetten in a double-blind study].</s><s>Codeine is generally accepted as the standard antitussive against which new antitussive medications are compared. This presents a problem because the support for codeine's antitussive activity comes from studies on cough in animals, and chronic and induced cough models in man, whereas antitussives are almost exclusively used for the treatment of cough associated with acute upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Firstly, to study the antitussive efficacy of codeine in cough associated with URTI and, secondly, to validate a sound meter as tool for quantifying cough. On study day 1 a highly significant (P < 0.0001) decrease in all three measures of cough was found after treatment with both placebo and codeine yet there was no significant difference between the treatment groups. The results demonstrate that codeine is no more effective than placebo in reducing cough associated with acute URTI, as measured by CSPLs, cough frequency or subjective symptom scores. The results also demonstrate that the sound-level meter appears to be a potentially useful investigative tool for the assessment of cough and antitussive efficacy.</s><s>A double-blind, crossover controlled evaluation of a syrup for the night-time relief of the symptoms of the common cold, containing paracetamol, dextromethorphan hydrobromide, doxylamine succinate and ephedrine sulphate.</s><s>A multicentered trial compared the effects of the non-sedating antihistamine, loratadine, 5 mg plus pseudoephedrine 120 mg with a placebo on the signs and symptoms of the common cold. Specific differences were found in symptoms including nasal congestion, sneezing, postnasal drainage, and nasal discharge.</s><s>The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a single night-time dose of a syrup containing paracetamol, dextromethorphan hydrobromide, doxylamine succinate and ephedrine sulfate in subjects with multiple cold symptoms. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, parallel design study. Subjects were randomized into either Group T (test syrup) or Group P (placebo syrup). On the evening of enrollment, subjects rated baseline symptoms, ingested the assigned study product and completed symptom-relief assessments at 3 hours post-dosing. Treatment comparisons were made after adjusting for the severity of baseline symptom using analysis of covariance. Of 485 subjects who took the study product, 432 (224 in Group T; 208 in Group P) were evaluable for analysis. Evidence of benefit with the test syrup was also seen in the higher score for overall night-time relief (p < 0.0001) and greater satisfaction on sleep (p = 0.002) compared to placebo syrup. The results confirm the multisymptom benefit of a single dose of the test syrup containing paracetamol, dextromethorphan hydrobromide, doxylamine succinate and ephedrine sulfate and support its role as an effective and convenient therapy for symptoms of nasal congestion, runny nose, cough and pain/body aches associated with the common cold and for increasing sleep quality disturbed by the common cold.</s><s>Effectiveness of antihistamines in common cold.</s><s>The efficacy of guaifenesin in reducing cough frequency in young adults with acute respiratory disease was evaluated by both an objective cough counting system and a questionnaire. A guaifenesin cough preparation and the syrup vehicle were administered in a double-blind manner. Coughs were recorded on tape over a 24-hour baseline evaluation period and a 36-hour treatment period for 42 patients. The evaluation of efficacy was based upon comparisons between equivalent six-hour time periods of successive days. Of 26 patients with productive cough receiving guaifenesin, 25 (96 percent) reported a decrease in sputum thickness compared to 13 (54 percent) of 24 patients receiving the vehicle (p = 0.01, Fisher exact test).</s><s>To determine whether the commonly used over-the-counter medications dextromethorphan and diphenhydramine are superior to placebo for the treatment of nocturnal cough and sleep difficulty associated with upper respiratory infections and to determine whether parents have improved sleep quality when their children receive the medications when compared with placebo. Sleep quality for both the child and the parent were also assessed for both nights. For the entire cohort, all outcomes were significantly improved on the second night of the study when either medication or placebo was given. However, neither diphenhydramine nor dextromethorphan produced a superior benefit when compared with placebo for any of the outcomes studied. Diphenhydramine and dextromethorphan are not superior to placebo in providing nocturnal symptom relief for children with cough and sleep difficulty as a result of an upper respiratory infection.</s><s>Methodology to evaluate the efficacy of antitussive drugs rely largely on subjective methods and cough counts. There are few studies in cough due to natural disease especially using objective techniques. This paper presents data from a series of randomized, double blind, placebo controlled clinical trials in cough due to both chronic bronchopulmonary disease and acute upper respiratory tract infections. Differences were observed in speed of action, and objective and subjective measures, that probably indicate differences in drug action. More recently, three studies evaluated the antitussive drug dextromethorphan in non-productive cough due to uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infections.</s><s>The purpose of the meta-analysis was to understand the antitussive effect of treatment with dextromethorphan hydrobromide, 30 mg, vs placebo over a 3-h treatment period in patients with cough due to uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), and to show that the computerized system for acquisition and analysis of cough sound was consistent and reproducible across the individual studies. The six studies used for the meta-analysis were randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, single-dose, placebo-controlled studies with a 3-h postdose cough evaluation period. One study was conducted in Durban, South Africa, and five studies were conducted in Bombay, India. Five efficacy variables were measured in 30-min intervals: cough bouts, cough components, cough effort, cough intensity, and cough latency. The consistent nature of the results shows that the computerized cough acquisition and analysis system is a valid and reproducible methodology for evaluating cough associated with URTI.</s><s>Dextromethorphan is one of the most widely used antitussives for the treatment of cough associated with acute upper respiratory tract infection. However, there is very little data to support the efficacy of dextromethorphan in this disease state. The study was a double-blind, stratified, randomized and parallel group design. Patients were randomized to placebo treatment (n = 22) and dextromethorphan treatment (n=21). The results showed similar trends in both treatment groups with statistically significant reductions (P < 0.05) in cough sound pressure level (CSPL), cough frequency (CF) and subjective scores for cough severity within treatment groups but little difference between the treatment groups during the study period. The only statistically significant difference between treatment groups was for the mean CSPL changes from baseline to 90 min (P=0.019).</s>"

Supplementary analgesic consumption was lower in group 3 than in group 2 during the 0-9 h interval immediately following surgery (P < 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences for any other parameters between the 3 groups.

It is concluded that the type of manual therapy used in this study seems to have a specific effect in reducing post-traumatic headache.</s><s>Twenty-two tension-neck and headache patients were divided into acupuncture and physiotherapy groups. In both of the groups a significant reduction of muscle tension was observed during the therapy period. After a follow-up period of 28 weeks, there was still a significant reduction of EMG activity in both groups. Also, the subjective level of headache decreased in these groups during the therapy period, and it was also significantly lowered after 28 weeks of follow-up.</s><s>The identification of musculoskeletal abnormalities in headache patients has led to the incorporation of physical therapy (PT) into treatment programs for chronic headache. The current studies: (i) investigated the efficacy of PT as a treatment for migraine, and (ii) investigated the utility of PT as an adjunct treatment in patients who fail to improve with relaxation training/thermal biofeedback (RTB).</s><s>Osteopathic manipulation in the treatment of muscle-contraction headache.</s><s>It is generally accepted that migraine is sensitive to intervention, whether in a treatment situation or in a clinical trial, and a \"placebo effect\" is often suggested. There was some evidence to suggest that placebo influences made a slight contribution to improvement, with sex, social class and subjects' optimism about the therapist at the initial treatment being weakly associated with initial improvement. The possibility that improvement levels reflected spontaneous improvement in migraine symptoms is suggested. If this possibility proves valid, clinical trials assessing migraine therapies should be designed so as to consider the natural course of migraine. Degree of improvement at follow-up could be predicted clearly from degree of improvement during the treatment phase and from degree of improvement at the end of the trial.</s><s>A randomized controlled trial of manipulation of the cervial spine was carried out on 52 patients in general practice, and the results were assessed symptomatically and goniometrically for three weeks. Manipulation also produced a significant increase in measured rotation that was maintained for three weeks and an immediate improvement in lateral flexion that was not maintained.This is to our knowledge the first published formal trial of such manipulation and should increase interest in this form of treatment by the medical profession.</s><s>A multicenter, randomized controlled trial with unblinded treatment and blinded outcome assessment was conducted. The treatment period was 6 weeks with follow-up assessment after treatment, then at 3, 6, and 12 months. Other outcomes included changes in headache intensity and duration, the Northwick Park Neck Pain Index, medication intake, and patient satisfaction. Physical outcomes included pain on neck movement, upper cervical joint tenderness, a craniocervical flexion muscle test, and a photographic measure of posture. There were no differences in headache-related and demographic characteristics between the groups at baseline.

The diagnosis of migraine was made on the basis of the International Headache Society standard, with a minimum of at least one migraine per month. The average response of the treatment group (n = 83) showed statistically significant improvement in migraine frequency (P < .005), duration (P < .01), disability (P < .05), and medication use (P< .001) when compared with the control group (n = 40). Four persons failed to complete the trial because of a variety of causes, including change in residence, a motor vehicle accident, and increased migraine frequency.

Treatment consisted of extremely low level, high frequency current applied transcranially. Both physicians and patients scored the placebo unit moderately or highly effective for only 16%. Approximately 10% of patients in each group reported at least one minor adverse experience. Cranial electrotherapy stimulation is distinct from TENS, and is safe and often effective in ameliorating the pain intensity of tension headaches. It should be considered as an alternative to the chronic usage of analgesics.</s><s>The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the long-term course of non-invasively treated chronic headache. A total of 1015 adult patients with primary diagnosis of vascular/migraine or muscle contraction headache participated in the study investigating symptom frequency and severity over a 36 month period after receiving treatment.

Those patients randomized to nutritional interventions were counselled to take oral nutrients with caloric intake equal to 1.7 to 1.95 times their basal energy expenditure, depending on their pretreatment nutritional status (\"standard\" group). Counselling increased caloric intake in both tumor types but reduced weight loss in the short term only for lung cancer patients. Overall, only 20.4% of the patients responded, and there were no significant differences in response rates, median time to progression, or overall duration of survival between the nutrition intervention groups and the control group.

Despite a tendency to greater weight loss at inclusion, the IS + ISGR group managed to gain weight significantly more rapidly and to a greater extent than the GR + SC group. No differences were seen in QoL ratings between randomization groups, but there was a positive correlation between weight development and QoL and a negative correlation between fatigue and weight development. IS, including nutritional support, leads to more rapid weight gain than SC in patients with newly diagnosed GI cancer.</s><s>Effects of combined nutritional treatment of patients at risk of protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) discharged from a geriatric service were evaluated. insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I)), Katz activities of daily living (ADL) index, mini mental status examination (MMSE) and quality of life (QoL) by SF-36 were assessed at the start of the study and after 4 months. Statistical analyses were performed on \"intention-to-treat\" and on \"treated-as-protocol\" bases.

The experimental group received diet counseling and oral supplementation, and the control group received diet counseling only. The comparison group received physician-prescribed oral supplements and dietary counseling to permit comparison of the experimental treatment with current supplementation practices. Differences between groups in the number of patients reaching nutritional repletion, change in SA levels at the end of the study, and follow-up periods, were tested using chi-square analysis. Overall, repletion occurred more quickly in the experimental group (3.2 +/- 1.7 months) than in the control group (3.5 +/- 1.2 months), with a larger number of patients in the experimental group repleted by month 2 of the study phase. It is also more likely that good nutritional status will be maintained after supplementation is discontinued.</s><s>Malnutrition in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with a poor prognosis, yet evidence to support the role of dietary counselling and food fortification is lacking. A study was undertaken to assess the impact of dietary counselling and food fortification on outcome in outpatients with COPD who are at risk of malnutrition. The intervention group received dietary counselling and advice on food fortification and the controls received a dietary advice leaflet. The intervention group consumed more energy (difference 194 kcal/day; p = 0.02) and protein (difference 11.8 g/day; p<0.001) than controls. The intervention group gained weight during the intervention period and maintained weight during follow-up; the controls lost weight throughout the study. Improvements in some variables persisted for 6 months beyond the intervention period.</s><s>The association between severe nutritional depletion and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has long been recognized. A potential therapeutic benefit to nutritional support was previously suggested by us in a pilot investigation. We report a randomized controlled study of nutritional therapy in underweight patients with COPD that combines an initial inpatient investigation (controlled nutritional support) with a prolonged outpatient follow-up interval. However, the intervention is costly, time-intensive, and of limited therapeutic magnitude.</s><s>Twenty-four orthognathic surgery patients were studied to determine the impact of a high-calorie liquid supplement on preventing or minimizing catabolism commonly associated with surgery. The experimental group of 12 subjects, chosen at random, consumed blenderized foods ad libitum and a high-calorie dietary supplement providing a minimum of 50% of energy requirements. In general, nutrient intake in the experimental group remained similar to that before surgery, whereas intake in the control group decreased significantly, particularly at the one-week postoperative evaluation.</s><s>After completed radiotherapy, 24 in-patients and 25 out-patients enrolled at the Department of Otolaryngology, National Hospital, were randomised to either tailored dietary information and instruction by a clinical nutritionist or regular dietary information from a nurse. The in-patients randomised to intensive dietary information were the only ones who did not lose weight.</s><s>Nutritional support improves antibody response to influenza virus vaccine in the elderly.</s><s>We aimed to determine the effect of dietary counseling or oral supplements on outcome for patients with cancer, specifically, nutritional outcome, morbidity, and quality of life (QOL), during and 3 months after radiotherapy. Nutritional intake (determined by diet history) and status (determined by Ottery's Subjective Global Assessment), and QOL (determined by the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire version 3.0 [EORTC QLQ-C30]) were evaluated at baseline, at the end of RT, and at 3 months. Both energy and protein intake decreased significantly in group 3 (p < .01). At 3 months, group 1 maintained intakes, whereas groups 2 and 3 returned to or below baseline levels. At 3 months, the reduction of incidence/severity of grade 1+2 anorexia, nausea/vomiting, xerostomia, and dysgeusia was different: 90% of the patients improved in group 1 versus 67% in group 2 versus 51% in group 3 (p < .0001).</s><s>The supplements were given for one month before surgery in an attempt to achieve a 5% weight gain and/or for six weeks after surgery to approximate 50% of the estimated caloric requirements of the patients. However, balanced nutrient intake can be achieved for patients when supplementation is given postoperatively at a level of 50% of estimated caloric requirements, and can result in improved nitrogen retention and protein sparing.</s><s>To investigate the impact of dietary counseling or nutritional supplements on outcomes in cancer patients: nutritional, morbidity, and quality of life (QoL) during and 3 months after radiotherapy. Nutritional intake (diet history), status (Ottery's Subjective Global Assessment), and QoL (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire version 3.0) were evaluated at baseline, at the end, and 3 months after radiotherapy. At radiotherapy completion, energy intake increased in G1/G2 (P < or = .04), G1 more than G2 (P = .001), and decreased in G3 (P < .01). At 3 months, G1 maintained nutritional intake and G2/G3 returned to baseline. At 3 months, G1 patients maintained/improved function, symptoms, and single-item scores (P < .02); in G2, only few function and symptom scales improved (P < .05); in G3, QoL remained as poor as after radiotherapy. During radiotherapy, both interventions positively influenced outcomes; dietary counseling was of similar or higher benefit, whereas even 3 months after RT, it was the only method to sustain a significant impact on patient outcomes.</s><s>Malnutrition is highly prevalent in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and is a strong predictor of increased morbidity and mortality. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of oral administration of an egg albumin-based protein supplement on the nutritional status of CAPD patients. During a 6-month follow-up, all patients had monthly clinical and biochemical evaluations and quarterly assessments of adequacy of dialysis and nutrition. Triceps skinfold thickness (TSF) and midarm muscle area (MAMA) displayed a nonsignificant trend to a greater increase in the study group (TSF 16.7+/-8.7 vs 18.3+/-10.7 mm; MAMA 23.8+/-6.2 vs 25.8+/-5.9 cm2) than in controls (TSF 16.4+/-5.7 vs 16.9+/-7.0 mm; MAMA 28.7+/-7.8 vs 30.0+/-7.9 cm2). At the end of follow-up, the frequency of patients with moderate or severe malnutrition decreased 6% in the control group and decreased 28% in the study group. This oral supplement may be a safe, effective, and cheap method to improve nutritional status in peritoneal dialysis patients.</s><s>Nutritional support is often recommended as part of the treatment of tuberculosis, but it has never been properly tested. Patients who started antituberculous therapy within the previous 2 wk were randomly assigned to receive standard nutritional counseling (control group) or nutritional counseling to increase their intake through diet and high-energy supplements (nutritional supplement group) for 6 wk. Early intervention to increase nutritional intake increases lean mass and physical function. This adjunct to tuberculosis therapy could confer socioeconomic and survival benefits that deserve investigation in large-scale trials.</s><s>No data is available on dietary intervention in candidates for lung transplantation and on the effect of different strategies for dietary support in this cohort. Group A received intensified dietary counselling, ready-made liquid nutritional supplements free of charge and regular follow-ups, while group B received only one session of individual dietary counselling, no supplements and no follow-ups. Group A increased their energy intake from a median of 8.7 to 10.1 MJ (p < 0.01 compared with the control group after intervention) and gained a mean of 2.9 kg body weight (95% CI 1.2; 4.7, p = 0.005 compared with the control group), while group B increased from 7.4 to 10.8 MJ (p = 0.005) and gained 2.3 kg (1.2; 3.3, p = 0.002).</s><s>These patients were affected by cancer of the head and neck, breast cancer, and abdominopelvic cancer. Data were collected the day before radiotherapy commenced and the day treatment ended. The results showed the benefit of dietetic treatment in experimental patients with head and neck or abdominopelvic cancer.</s><s>The aim of the study was to compare the influence on nutritional status of nutritional supplementation with a standard polymeric formula as well as nutritional counselling versus isolated nutritional counselling in a group of HIV-infected patients. Group I patients received standard enteral formula (3 cans/day, 250 ml per can). Patients were submitted to a prospective serial assessment of their nutrition status (anthropometric and biochemical status) and the nutritional intake was determined by means of 24-hours written food records.</s><s>Nine patients with advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and recent weight loss resulting in a state of mild malnutrition were entered into a refeeding program at a clinical research center. They were divided into two groups, one using a hospital diet and the other a hospital diet with supplementation. Refeeding and weight gain were associated with a significant increase in absolute lymphocyte count and with an increase in reactivity to skin test antigens after 21 days of refeeding.</s><s>A randomized controlled trial previously conducted in radiation oncology patients demonstrated that nutrition intervention had a beneficial impact on body weight, nutritional status, and quality of life compared with standard practice, but it did not report on dietary intake data. Sixty consecutive radiation oncology outpatients (51 men and nine women; age 61.9+/-14 years [mean+/-standard deviation]). Dietary intake (protein, energy, fiber) assessed at baseline and at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after starting radiotherapy. The nutrition intervention group had a higher mean total energy (P=0.029) and protein intake (P<0.001) compared with the standard practice group. Mean intake per kilogram of body weight for the nutrition intervention group ranged from 28 to 31 kcal/kg/day compared with 25 to 29 kcal/kg/day for the standard practice group (P=0.022). Intensive nutrition intervention following the ADA MNT protocol results in improved dietary intake compared with standard practice and seems to beneficially impact nutrition-related outcomes previously observed in oncology outpatients receiving radiotherapy.</s>"

With the exception of PA density, there were no significant differences between both treatment strategies after 14 days of treatment. Standard audiometry tests revealed no evidence of a hearing impairment in any patient following therapy. Forced expiratory volume increased by approximately 5% of the predicted volume, forced vital capacity increased by 2% of predicted capacity, and forced mid expiratory flow rate increased by 7% (A) or 4% (B) of the predicted normal value, although these changes were not statistically significant.</s><s>The aim of this study was to test the equivalence of once- and thrice-daily dosing with tobramycin by comparing efficacy and safety in adult patients with cystic fibrosis. Primary efficacy and safety endpoints were defined as changes in respiratory function and changes in renal function and hearing.

Primary outcome measure was change in forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1), over the 14 days of treatment, expressed as a percentage of the predicted normal value for age, sex, and height. The study was powered for equivalence, and primary analysis was per protocol. 219 patients (107 once daily, 112 three-times daily) completed the study per protocol. Of 122 patients assigned to once daily treatment, three did not receive the study regimen. The mean change in FEV1 (% predicted) over 14 days was similar on the two regimens (10.4% [once daily] vs 10.0% [three-times daily]; adjusted mean difference 0.4% [95% CI -3.3 to 4.1]).</s>"

HIV-infected subjects who had CD4 cell counts greater than 200 per cubic millimeter, who had been treated with indinavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine, and who had less than 200 copies of HIV RNA per milliliter of plasma after 16, 20, and 24 weeks of induction therapy were randomly assigned to receive either continued triple-drug therapy (106 subjects), indinavir alone (103 subjects), or a combination of zidovudine and lamivudine (107 subjects). The primary end point was loss of viral suppression, which was defined as a plasma level of at least 200 copies of HIV RNA per milliliter on two consecutive measurements during maintenance therapy. The presence of zidovudine-resistance mutations in HIV RNA at base line was strongly predictive of the loss of viral suppression in subjects treated with zidovudine and lamivudine.</s><s>Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has led to health benefits for patients infected with HIV-1.

Leflunomide (LEF) and the biologic agents entered the arsenal of DMARDs in 1998. Only patients with RA resistant to MTX were included in groups receiving LEF or a biologic agent. During follow-up, patients' characteristics, disease characteristics, and clinical and laboratory data were registered. All groups revealed statistically significant improvement in all disease activity parameters measured. The percentage improvements were similar in groups treated with MTX and LEF and--except for VAS--significantly greater in the group treated with a biologic agent. Disease activity assessed by DAS 28 decreased significantly in all groups: the results were comparable in groups treated with MTX and LEF and significantly more prominent in the group treated with a TNF-alpha blocker. The ACR 20, 50 and 70 improvements amounted, respectively: 100, 50 and 7% in MTX group 87, 60 and 13% in LEF group and 100, 83 and 50% in a biologic agent group.</s><s>Ethical constraints on the conduct of placebo-controlled trials evaluating new therapies for serious chronic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), indicate the need for discerning methods to assess treatment effect in active-controlled clinical trials. Therefore, this investigation was undertaken to evaluate DEMRI as an efficacy assessment tool for differentiating treatment effect in a randomized, active-controlled trial comparing leflunomide and methotrexate. DEMRI scans were obtained at baseline and at 4 months, and the initial rate of enhancement (IRE) and the maximal signal intensity (SI) enhancement (ME) were calculated from the SI curves. Thirty-four patients (17 treated with leflunomide and 17 with methotrexate) had usable baseline and end point DEMRI scans.

Diarrhea and nausea were less frequent during the open-label extension in patients who did not receive a LEF loading dose. Response to therapy was maintained to 48 weeks of treatment in patients who continued to receive LEF and MTX during the extension. Importantly, ACR20 response rates after 24 weeks of LEF therapy were similar between patients switched from PLA to LEF without loading dose, and those who received a loading does of LEF (100 mg/day x 2 days) at randomization.

Side effects made itself clear in 6 patients in the daily leflunomide group, and 2 patients withdrawn leflunomide because severe gastrointestinal symptoms and hepatotoxicity, respectively. In the group of weekly leflunomide 2 patients presented side effects which disappeared spontaneously. The use of leflunomide in a weekly dose of 100 mg proved to have similar therapeutic benefit as that of the conventional scheme and might represent a new option for the treatment of refractory rheumatoid arthritis patients.</s><s>Phase II trials of leflunomide, an inhibitor of de-novo pyrimidine synthesis, have shown efficacy in rheumatoid arthritis. This double-blind randomised trial compared leflunomide with placebo and sulphasalazine in active rheumatoid arthritis. The primary endpoints were tender and swollen joint counts and investigator's and patient's overall assessments. Leflunomide and sulphasalazine were significantly superior to placebo (p=0.0001 for joint counts; p<0.001 for assessments). Radiographic disease progression was significantly slower with leflunomide and sulphasalazine than with placebo (p<0.01). Transiently abnormal liver function was seen in three leflunomide-group patients and five sulphasalazine-group patients.</s><s>Radiographic disease progression with leflunomide and sulfasalazine treatment was assessed in rheumatoid arthritis patients in a double-blind trial that was placebo controlled for the first 6 months. Changes in Larsen scores were assessed in evaluable patient cohorts at 6 (n=228), 12 (n=136), and 24 (n=65) months. Changes in erosive joint counts within the 24-month leflunomide cohort suggest halting of disease progression for patients who continued in the study for 2 years (leflunomide -0.92, sulfasalazine 0.80). Leflunomide was well tolerated with no unexpected adverse events during the 2-year period.</s><s>To assess the efficacy of leflunomide or methotrexate compared with placebo in improving function and health-related quality of life in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and to examine correlations between response status (as defined by the American College of Rheumatology [ACR] response criteria) and improvement in these measures. Improvement in the PET top 5 and SF-36 scales and component scores were compared with ACR response rates. Clinically meaningful and statistically significant (P<0.0001) improvement in measures of function and heath-related quality of life (MHAQ scores, all scales and disability index of the HAQ, weighted top 5 score of the PET, 5 of 8 scales and physical component score of the SF-36, and work productivity) was seen during treatment with leflunomide in comparison with placebo. Significant improvements in function and health-related quality of life occurred in patients with RA during treatment with leflunomide or methotrexate. These findings were clinically meaningful and correlated with the ACR response status.</s><s>To evaluate the efficacy and safety of adding sulfasalazine to leflunomide treatment compared with switching to sulfasalazine alone in patients with RA with an inadequate response to leflunomide monotherapy. The primary efficacy variable was the DAS28 response rate, and secondary efficacy outcomes were ACR 20%, 50%, and 70% response rates. In the intention to treat population, more patients receiving leflunomide plus sulfasalazine (25/56 (45%)) achieved a DAS28 response than those receiving placebo plus sulfasalazine (17/50 (34%)) (p = 0.179). Comparable numbers in each group were ACR 20% responders; the ACR 50% response rate was significantly higher in the leflunomide plus sulfasalazine group (8.9%) than in the placebo plus sulfasalazine group (0%) (p = 0.038).</s><s>To assess the safety and effectiveness of leflunomide versus placebo in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated for 6 months. Gastrointestinal symptoms, weight loss, allergic reactions, skin rash, and reversible alopecia were more common in the 10-mg and 25-mg dosage groups. The incidence of infections was similar between the treatment and placebo groups; no opportunistic infections were seen. Transient elevations in liver function studies were noted in a small number of patients. Leflunomide is effective in daily doses of 10 mg and 25 mg in patients with active RA. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials using daily doses of 10 mg and 20 mg are under way in the US and Europe to confirm these positive results.</s><s>To compare the efficacy and safety profile of two daily maintenance doses of leflunomide, 10 mg and 20 mg, for the treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In this multinational, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study, 402 RA patients were randomized equally to receive daily doses of 10 mg leflunomide (n = 202; loading dose on day 3, 100 mg) or 20 mg leflunomide (n = 200; loading dose on day 1-3, 100 mg) for 24 weeks. The study was designed to demonstrate non-inferiority of the efficacy of 10 mg compared with 20 mg by calculating 95% confidence intervals for differences in changes in tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC) and Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ DI), comparing these confidence intervals with predefined bounds. In the intent-to-treat population, mean improvements at the end-point in the 10 and 20 mg groups respectively were: TJC, -7.57 and -8.89 (P = 0.061); SJC, -6.38 and -6.96 (P = 0.304); and HAQ DI, 0-0.37 and 0-0.49 (P = 0.095). More AEs resulting in treatment discontinuation and SAEs in patients receiving 10 mg leflunomide daily also support a better efficacy profile for the 20 mg daily dose.</s><s>Three 6-12-month, double-blind, randomized, controlled trials have shown leflunomide (LEF; 20 mg/day, loading dose 100 mg x 3 days) to be effective and safe for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The year-2 cohort, comprising patients continuing into the second year of treatment with > or = 1 dose of study medication and > or = 1 followup visit after week 52, consisted of 235 patients (LEF n = 98; placebo n = 36; MTX n = 101). Statistical comparisons of the active treatments only were prospectively defined in the protocol. In total, 85% and 79% of LEF and MTX patients, respectively, who entered year 2 completed 24 months of treatment. Maximal improvements evident at 6 months in the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) disability index (HAQ DI) and the physical component score of the Medical Outcomes Survey 36-item short form were sustained over 12 months and 24 months; improvement in the HAQ DI with LEF4(-0.60) was statistically significantly superior to that with MTX (-0.37) at 24 months (P = 0.005). The safety and efficacy of LEF and MTX were maintained over the second year of this 2-year trial. Results indicate that LEF is a safe and effective initial treatment for active RA, with clinical benefit sustained over 2 years of treatment without evidence of new or increased toxicity.</s><s>In a step-up approach of DMARD treatment of RA a fast response and an early DMARD switch in the case of non-response is important. MTX and LEF naïve patients with RA (mean time since diagnosis: 2.3 years) were randomised to receive either LEF in a 3-day-loading dose of 100 mg/day followed by 20 mg/day (n = 19) or MTX intramuscularly in a dose of 25 mg once weekly (n = 21). After 8 weeks of treatment the DAS28 in the MTX-group was 2.59 +/- 1.0 and 3.16 +/- 0.8 in the LEF group (difference not significant). Efficiency of RA treatment with MTX or LEF in intensified doses and in combination with moderate dose prednisone can be sufficiently judged 8 weeks after its initiation.</s><s>We previously reported that the new disease modifying antirheumatic drug leflunomide resulted in significant improvement in functional ability compared with placebo and sulfasalazine in a 6 month double blind, randomized, Phase III trial in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Patients on active regimens continued taking leflunomide 20 mg/day or sulfasalazine 2 g/day; those taking placebo were switched at Month 6 to sulfasalazine. Leflunomide significantly improved patients' functional ability compared to placebo (p < or = 0.0001) and sulfasalazine (p < or = 0.01) at 6 months. These changes were seen as early as Month 1, and continued improvements were seen in 12 and 24 month cohorts. Leflunomide is safe and well tolerated and no unexpected adverse events were noted during the 2 year period; diarrhea, nausea, and alopecia were less frequent with continued treatment. The benefit of leflunomide is reflected in other efficacy criteria, such as global assessments and the American College of Rheumatology response rates, all of which showed significantly more improvement with leflunomide than sulfasalazine at 24 months.</s><s>This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of leflunomide and sulfasalazine in rheumatoid arthritis over a two year follow up period. Improvement in other variables was comparable for the two drugs, including slowing of disease progression. Improved HAQ scores in 6, 12, and 24 month leflunomide cohorts were seen in both non-responders (24%, 29%, 35%, respectively v sulfasalazine 8%, 10%, 27%) and ACR20% responders (leflunomide 63%, 62%, 66% v sulfasalazine 50%, 64%, 44%). Leflunomide is well tolerated at doses of 20 mg. No unexpected adverse events or late toxicity were noted during the two year period. Diarrhoea, nausea, and alopecia were less frequent with continued treatment.</s><s>Leflunomide is a reversible inhibitor of de novo pyrimidine synthesis shown to be effective in a phase 2 trial in 402 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Forty-seven university and private rheumatology practices in the United States and Canada. Leflunomide treatment (20 mg/d), placebo, or methotrexate treatment (7.5-15 mg/wk). American College of Rheumatology success rate (completed 52 weeks of treatment and met the ACR > or = 20% response criteria), disease progression as assessed by x-ray films, and improvement in function and health-related quality of life using the intent-to-treat population. X-ray analyses demonstrated less disease progression with leflunomide (P=.001) and methotrexate (P = .02) therapy than with placebo. Leflunomide and methotrexate treatment improved measures of physical function and health-related quality of life significantly more than placebo (P<.001 and P<.05, respectively). Common adverse events for patients receiving leflunomide treatment included gastrointestinal complaints, skin rash, and reversible alopecia. Both active treatments improved signs and symptoms of active RA, delayed disease progression as demonstrated by x-ray films, and improved function and health-related quality of life.</s><s>This study assessed the efficacy and safety of combination (COMB) of cyclosporine (CSA) and leflunomide (LEF) versus each drug alone, in the treatment of severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA). One hundred six patients with active RA refractory to at least one disease modifying antirheumatic drug (methotrexate obligatorily) were entered into a 12-month open, prospective trial and were randomly allocated to receive either CSA 2.5 to 5 mg/kg/day, or LEF 20 mg/day, or the combination of both at the same initiating dose. Combination therapy was also significantly better than CSA and LEF at the more stringent 70% response rate (69% vs 34% vs 30%, respectively; p = 0.001). No unexpected or serious adverse drug effects were identified in the combination group during the 12-month period.</s>"

No significant differences were determined in therapeutic response among those infants treated with methadone, phenobarbital, and diazepam. There was a significant reduction in the frequency of withdrawal symptoms among infants born to mothers whose methadone dose at time of delivery was less than 20 mg (17.9 per cent).</s><s>To determine if oral clonidine would reduce the duration of opioid detoxification for neonatal abstinence syndrome. All enrolled infants (80) received oral diluted tincture of opium according to a standardized algorithm and were randomly assigned to receive oral clonidine (1 microg/kg every 4 hours) (40 infants) or placebo (40 infants). The median length of therapy was 27% shorter in the clonidine group (11 [95% confidence interval: 8-15 days]) than in the placebo group (15 days [95% confidence interval: 12-17 days]). In the clonidine group, 7 infants required restarting opium after initial discontinuation versus none in the placebo group, with the total length of treatment/observation remaining significantly less in the clonidine group. Hypertension, hypotension, bradycardia, or desaturations did not occur in either group.</s><s>The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that treatment of neonatal opiate withdrawal (NOW) in the term infant with diluted tincture of opium (DTO) and phenobarbital was superior to treatment with DTO alone. Study design: This was a partially randomized, controlled trial in which 20 term infants exposed to methadone and/or heroin in utero were studied. There were no significant differences in the gestational age, growth variables, maternal methadone dose, or age at enrollment between the 2 groups.

While some investigators have examined the efficacy of these agents in treating NAS, there are no data regarding the use of specific pharmacologic agents and developmental outcome. This study evaluated 85 infants born to drug-dependent women who were maintained on methadone during pregnancy. When treatment was not successful with the assigned agent, one of the other agent(s) was used. Based on NAS treatment, four groups were defined: paregoric (n = 21); phenobarbital (n = 17); more than one agent (n = 31); and no treatment (n = 16). Data for the phenobarbital loading and titration groups were combined since analysis revealed no differences between groups.

Inotropic support with dopamine infusion was given if the infants remained hypotensive after a total of three infusions (30 ml/kg). There was no difference in the volume of the test solutions required between the two groups. The difference in weight gain was significant at 48 hours even when only those infants not requiring inotropic support or extra 5% albumin were compared (group 1: 1.5(1.5)%, group 2: -4.2(1.1)%; P = 0.027). Isotonic saline is as effective as 5% albumin for treating hypotension in preterm infants, and it has the additional advantage of causing less fluid retention in the first 48 hours.</s><s>Exchange transfusion, as a form of therapy, was contrasted with the use of fresh frozen plasma or conventional supportive care alone in the management of 19 infants with birth weights of less than 1,000 gm, without severe respiratory distress, and in the management of 82 infants, birth weights less than 2,000 gm, with severe respiratory distress whose disease manifested itself within the first 24 hours of life. Survival for more than five days was similar, regardless of therapy, in infants weighing less than 1,000 gm without severe RDS. In contrast, the use of exchange transfusion significantly decreased the case fatality rate of infants with severe RDS. Following exchange transfusion there was a significant decrease in the ratio of FIO2 to PaO2, suggesting that pulmonary perfusion and/or ventilation was improved by the procedure.</s><s>Seventy three preterm infants weighing less than 1500 g or less than 32 weeks' gestation, or both, were allocated randomly to treatment (fresh frozen plasma 10 ml/kg on admission and at 24 hours of age) or control groups.

Patients were evaluated for skeletal complications: pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, irradiation of or surgery on bone, or hypercalcemia. The skeletal morbidity rate (the ratio of the number of skeletal complications to the time on trial) was the primary efficacy variable. Bone pain, use of analgesics, quality of life, performance status, bone tumor response, and biochemical parameters were also evaluated. The skeletal morbidity rate was significantly reduced at 12, 18, and 24 cycles in patients treated with 90 mg of pamidronate (P = .028, .023, and .008, respectively). The time to the first skeletal complication was longer for patients receiving pamidronate than for those given placebo (P = .049).</s><s>To study the effects of oral clodronate on bone pain in patients with advanced metastatic bone disease. Analgesic use increased with disease progression to a similar extent in both groups (59% increased use in the clodronate group v 64% of placebo group; difference not significant). Ten patients (37%) in the clodronate group and 12 (46%) in the placebo group withdrew from the study prematurely, most often because of difficulty with swallowing the capsules. Perhaps as a result of these factors, it proved difficult to maintain patients on therapy. Further studies will be needed to define the role of bisphosphonates such as clodronate in this situation, in comparison with established treatments such as radiotherapy and analgesics.</s><s>Despite evidence that clodronate inhibits tumor-induced osteolysis, no studies have directly assessed the optimal dose for long-term treatment. The aim of this double-blind, placebo-controlled study was to determine the safety and efficacy of different doses of clodronate in affected patients. In the clodronate-treated groups, there was a dose-dependent reduction in fasting calcium excretion with a highly significant difference between placebo and 1,600 mg clodronate (P = .0002) and placebo and 3,200 mg clodronate (P = .0001), but no significant difference between 1,600 mg and 3,200 mg clodronate. Since there was no significant difference between these two doses in terms of efficacy at 4 weeks, 1,600 mg/d can be recommended for long-term treatment.</s><s>We report the long-term effects of dichloromethylene diphosphonate (CI2MDP), an inhibitor of bone resorption, on the skeletal lesions in multiple myeloma. Finally, iliac crest bone biopsies showed a reduction in osteoclast number after CI2MDP administration. We conclude from these results that CI2MDP could be of use in preventing the bone loss that occurs in multiple myeloma.</s><s>To evaluate the effectiveness of intravenous clodronate in ameliorating refractory bone pain in patients with metastatic bone disease, 60 patients with established osseous metastases and persistent bone pain were randomized to receive either clodronate (600 mg or 1500 mg in 500 mL of normal saline) or 500 mL of saline as placebo. After 2 weeks, the patients were crossed over to receive the alternate treatment. First period analysis of the VAS scores for general pain, pain at rest, and pain upon movement demonstrated an average reduction of 13, 14, and 24 mm, respectively, from baseline, but were not significantly different from changes following placebo. The average change in DMED was -6.4 (SE = 2.9) following clodronate and was +24.6 (SE = 14.9) following placebo (p = 0.03). For the investigators who also made a blinded selection, clodronate was chosen in 30 (65%) patients, placebo in ten (22%) patients, and no difference was apparent in six (13%) (p < 0.0001). The optimal dose and duration of effect require further evaluation, particularly in patients with stable disease and persistent bone pain.</s><s>Sodium etidronate is a diphosphonate compound that inhibits bone resorption and mineralization. Fifty-seven patients were entered into a randomized, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of sodium etidronate. No difference was seen in the symptomatic response rate or analgesic requirement between patients treated with sodium etidronate and placebo. With the dose scheme used in this study sodium etidronate was ineffective for palliation of bone pain from prostatic cancer.</s><s>After a baseline symptom and laboratory assessment, 24 patients with metastatic bone disease and pain were randomized to receive either a 4-hr intravenous infusion of 2-dichloromethylene bisphosphonate (Cl2MDP), 600 mg in 500 mL of normal saline, or a 4-hr placebo infusion, 500 mL of normal saline. After 1 wk, the assessment was repeated and the patients were crossed over to the alternate treatment. After 1 more wk, a final assessment and blinded choice by the patient and investigator took place. The investigator chose the Cl2MDP in 14 (67%) cases, placebo in 6 (29%) cases and was unable to discern a difference in 1 (5%) case (p less than 0.05). The patients and investigator made similar selections in 16 (76%) instances. No significant difference in the daily oral morphine equivalent analgesic requirement was demonstrated for either arm.</s><s>The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of low dose oral clodronate in palliation of pain arising from bone metastases (BM) and to determine the optimal oral clodronate dose which inhibits osteolysis caused by tumor. The patients were randomized into three groups according to the dose of clodronate. Groups A and B were given 800 mg/d and 1600 mg/d of oral clodronate respectively for 3 months. Group A contained 16 patients, and groups B and C contained 17 patients each. After 3 months use of oral clodronate, significant decrease in the pain score of groups A and B was noted when compared to group C (P = 0.024 and P = 0.007, respectively). Pain score increased in 5 patients in group C (29%), and 3 patients in groups A (19%) and B (18%) each.</s><s>The aim of this study was to evaluate pamidronate for bone pain in a randomised double-blind trial and to evaluate the contribution of new markers of bone resorption in patients with bone metastases. Fifty-two patients with painful bone metastases were randomised to receive a two-hour infusion of pamidronate 120 mg or an identical infusion of saline. Bone resorption markers measured included urinary calcium (uCa), hydroxyproline (Hyp), and the collagen breakdown products: NTx, Crosslaps and Free Dpd. Symptomatic response during the first four weeks was seen after pamidronate, but not with placebo (P < 0.05). Subjective benefit after intravenous pamidronate is confirmed in this placebo-controlled study.</s><s>In order to study whether oral bisphosphonate therapy might prevent or reduce skeletal-related morbidity in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who required chemotherapy, 300 patients were included in a randomized multi-centre trial. Patients were given oral pamidronate at a dose of 300 mg daily, or placebo, in addition to conventional intermittent melphalan/prednisolone (and in some cases alpha-interferon) treatment. Pamidronate treatment also did not have any influence on patient survival or on the frequency of hypercalcaemia. The overall negative result of the study is attributed to the very low absorption of orally administered bisphosphonates in general.</s><s>Fifty-seven patients with advanced prostate cancer resistant to first-line hormonal therapy were treated with estramustine and additionally randomized for treatment with clodronate or placebo. Skeletal pain relief was only about 10% better in the clodronate than in the placebo group.</s><s>Although osteosclerotic metastases are characteristic of prostatic carcinoma, bone resorption is also accelerated. Simultaneously they were randomly allocated to clodronate (36) and placebo (39) groups. The dose was 3.2 g for the first month, thereafter 1.6 g. Pain relief was more distinct in the clodronate group where one third of patients were totally free of bone pain. The use of analgesics stopped in 38% of patients on clodronate and in 18% on placebo which effect probably belongs to estramustine phosphate. No significant differences were seen in median survival or survival rates between the groups.</s><s>Cancer patients with painful osteolytic bone metastases who had failed initial treatment with hormones and/or chemotherapy were each randomized to receive one of three pamidronate doses as outpatients: 45, 60, 90 mg given every 3 weeks for 12 weeks. Forty-eight patients took nonsteroidal antinflammatory drugs, while 22 patients received morphine before pamidronate treatment. A reduction in bone pain and mobility scores was observed in all three different dose groups: in 11 of 23 patients (47%) at 45 mg; in 12 of 24 patients (50%) at 60 mg; and in 16 of 23 patients (69%) at 90 mg. In weeks 0-6, the daily consumption of analgesics was reduced in 3 patients in the 45-mg arm, in 4 patients in the 60-mg arm, and in 7 patients in the 90-mg arm. In 2 patients (45 and 90 mg) fever (> 38 degrees C) and myalgia were observed after the first administration.</s><s>Osteolytic lesions and pathological fractures are common in multiple myeloma. The proportion of patients with progression of osteolytic bone lesions was twice as high in the placebo group (n = 168 at baseline) than in the clodronate group (n = 168 at baseline) in an intention-to-treat analysis (24 vs 12%, p = 0.026). We conclude that clodronate is an effective and safe adjunct in the management of multiple myeloma. The drug delays osteolytic bone lesions, reduces the degree of hypercalcaemia and hypercalciuria, and decreases pain.</s><s>A total of 295 patients with lytic bone metastases from breast cancer were randomized to receive chemotherapy or chemotherapy plus pamidronate (Aredia) 45 mg intravenously every 3 weeks. Primary endpoints were time to progressive bone disease (evaluated by blind extramural review), and improvement in pain (according to a 6-point self-assessment scale). Marked improvement in bone pain was observed in 44% of patients receiving pamidronate compared to 30% in controls (p = 0.025). With respect to secondary endpoints, pamidronate reduced the need for radiotherapy (66 times vs. 82 times in controls), and median time to radiotherapy was 697 days with pamidronate, 571 in the control arm. We conclude that intravenous pamidronate is well tolerated, significantly prolongs time to progressive bone disease, and significantly improves bone pain in patients with osteolytic metastases from breast cancer.</s><s>Progressive bone disease in multiple myeloma frequently leads to osteolysis, bone resorption, pathologic fractures, vertebral compression, and hypercalcemia. The patients were randomly assigned to receive oral EHDP 5 mg/kg/d or placebo until death or discontinuation due to intolerance or refusal. The frequency of pathologic fractures, hypercalcemia, and bone pain was regularly assessed, as well as size and number of osteolytic lesions. There was no significant difference in bone pain, episodes of hypercalcemia, or development of pathologic fractures. Patients on EHDP showed less deterioration in their vertebral index, but this difference only approached statistical significance (P = .07). We conclude that EHDP therapy used in this dosage schedule does not have a clinically significant impact in multiple myeloma.</s><s>Because osteoclastic bone resorption is stimulated in multiple myeloma, we evaluated the efficacy of etidronate in this disease, in a multicentre controlled study. The evaluation was clinical (pain, Karnofsky, survival), biological and radiological. Forty-one patients had iliac bone biopsy before the treatment and 34 patients also at the end of the study. Compared with controls, pretreatment biopsies showed markedly increased bone resorption and decreased trabecular bone volume. Though we found no clinical, biological and radiological difference with placebo, etidronate inhibited the increased bone resorption in multiple myeloma.</s><s>Ten women with skeletal metastases from breast carcinoma received dichloromethylene diphosphonate (Cl2MDP), an inhibitor of osteoclast function, in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study. Eight of these patients had either hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria, and all 10 had elevated urinary hydroxyproline levels as evidence of active skeletal disease. After eight weeks of oral dichloromethylene diphosphonate treatment (3,200 mg per day), either preceded by or followed by an eight-week placebo period, seven of eight patients with hypercalciuria had significant reductions in urinary calcium levels, and nine of 10 had reductions in urinary hydroxyproline levels (significant in eight) when the dichloromethylene diphosphonate treatment periods were compared with prestudy or placebo periods. There were no adverse effects other than transient diarrhea in some patients.</s><s>The aim of this double-blind, randomized study was to compare the effects of two pamidronate dosages, given as repeated infusions in patients with advanced malignant osteolytic bone disease and bone pain. Pain parameters, analgesic consumption and performance status were assessed at baseline and throughout the study. Sixty percent (95% CI 41-77%) of the patients in the 60 mg group and 63% (95% CI 44-79%) of the patients in the 90-mg group had a sustained reduction of pain intensity and were classified as pain responders. Median duration of pain response was 15 versus 12 weeks in the 60-mg and 90-mg groups, respectively (P = 0.32). After two infusions, significant changes in pain intensity, pain frequency, general well-being and WHO pain score were observed (P<0.01). A trend toward improved performance status and reduced consumption of analgesics was also observed. In conclusion, bone pain can be effectively reduced by repeated pamidronate infusions in patients with advanced osteolytic bone disease.</s><s>Treatment of the symptoms of bone metastases currently involves the use of narcotic medication, radiation therapy, or hormonal therapy. Ambulatory female patients age 18 years or older with breast cancer metastatic to bone and a life expectancy of at least 3 months were eligible for the study. Bone metastases were confirmed by bone scan or bone survey within 6 months of enrollment. The change from baseline in pain score was determined for each patient at each study visit and at endpoint, defined as the last postbaseline evaluation for each patient before or at week 12. Secondary efficacy variables included narcotic scores, urinary calcium/creatinine and hydroxyproline/creatinine ratios, serum osteocalcin and bone alkaline phosphatase concentrations, and bone lesion (radiologic) response. At 3 months, the regimens of 60 mg every 4 weeks, 60 mg every 2 weeks, and 90 mg every 4 weeks resulted in significant reduction in bone pain beginning by week 6 of treatment.</s><s>Thirty-eight normocalcemic patients with bone metastases from breast carcinoma were randomized to receive dichloromethylene diphosphonate (CL2MDP) in addition to their specific antitumor treatment (chemotherapy and/or hormone therapy), at a dose of 300 mg/day/i.v. In both groups of patients there was a reduction in the intensity of pain (Scott-Huskisson analog), but there was a more frequent reduction in the daily consumption of analgesics in patients treated with CL2MDP (p = 0.02). Tolerance was excellent: only a few patients complained of pain at the intramuscular drug injection site.</s><s>Bisphosphonates are used in oncology as a means of decreasing complications due to bone metastases, in association with anticancer treatment, especially in patients with breast cancer, prostate cancer and myeloma. We conducted a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial of oral clodronate in patients with bone metastases from tumors poorly responsive to chemotherapy, with the aims of evaluating the effects of this drug on symptoms control and bone metastases evolution. Patients were randomized to receive either clodronate 1,600 mg/day for one year or identical placebo-containing tablets. Of the 66 patients enrolled, 9 were observed for one month or less; 7 were followed for two months; only 50 patients were followed for more than 2 months and could be adequately evaluated. At 3 months both clodronate and placebo-treated patients had a decrease in Karnofsky performance status, with the decrease being more evident in the placebo group. Mean pain scores showed an increase of pain in patients receiving placebo and a decrease of pain in patients receiving clodronate, although the difference failed to be statistically significant. This might partly account for the lack of significance of some of the parameters under study.</s><s>Skeletal complications are a major clinical manifestation of multiple myeloma. Bisphosphonates such as pamidronate inhibit osteoclastic activity and reduce bone resorption. Skeletal events (pathologic fracture, irradiation of or surgery on bone, and spinal cord compression), hypercalcemia (symptoms or a serum calcium concentration > or = 12 mg per deciliter [3.0 mmol per liter]), bone pain, analgesic-drug use, performance status, and quality of life were assessed monthly. The proportion of patients who had any skeletal events was significantly lower in the pamidronate group (24 percent) than in the placebo group (41 percent, P < 0.001), and the reduction was evident in both stratum 1 (P = 0.04) and stratum 2 (P = 0.004). Monthly infusions of pamidronate provide significant protection against skeletal complications and improve the quality of life of patients with stage III multiple myeloma.</s><s>Bisphosphonates such as pamidronate disodium inhibit osteoclast-induced bone resorption associated with cancer that has metastasized to bone. Women with stage IV breast cancer who were receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy and had at least one lytic bone lesion were given either placebo or pamidronate (90 mg) as a two-hour intravenous infusion monthly for 12 cycles. Bone pain, use of analgesic drugs, performance status, and quality of life were assessed throughout the trial. The median time to the occurrence of the first skeletal complication was greater in the pamidronate group than in the placebo group (13.1 vs. 7.0 months, P=0.005), and the proportion of patients in whom any skeletal complication occurred was lower (43 percent vs. 56 percent, P = 0.008).</s><s>Fifty-five patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer and painful bone metastases were randomised either to placebo or to clodronate 300 mg i.v. As regards mean worst pain a substantial numerical fall was registered for the treatment group, 21 mm, but the improvement was not significant compared to that of the placebo group. This was probably due to the limited number of patients (the study was prematurely ended due to problems recruiting patients). In conclusion, no significant differences were found between the treatment arm and the controls, in contrast to results from previous studies.</s><s>An open, randomized study was performed to assess the effects of supportive pamidronate treatment on morbidity from bone metastases in breast cancer patients. Twenty-nine of 81 pamidronate (HD/LD) patients first received 600 mg/d and were then changed to 300 mg/d; 52 of 81 pamidronate LD patients received 300 mg/d throughout the study. The event-free period (EFP), radiologic course of disease, and survival did not improve. Compared with their controls, in pamidronate HD/LD patients, events occurred 60% to 90% less frequently (P < or = .03) and the EFP was prolonged (P = .002). Pamidronate treatment of breast cancer patients efficaciously reduced skeletal morbidity.</s><s>47 patients with progressive, painful, predominantly lytic bone metastases from breast cancer were included in a randomised double-blind phase II trial comparing the effects of pamidronate 150 and 300 mg daily. No obvious differences in efficacy were observed between the two dose levels. Gastrointestinal adverse events, principally comprising nausea and vomiting, were the most commonly reported side-effects leading to discontinuation of trial treatment in 4 of 24 and 2 of 23 patients at 300 and 150 mg dose levels, respectively. The poor tolerability of oral pamidronate coupled with the modest clinical effects reported here suggest that oral pamidronate will not replace the current strategy of regular intravenous infusions of pamidronate for the treatment of osteolytic bone disease.</s>"

After a 2-wk, single-blind, placebo run-in period, 398 patients who continued to experience moderate intensity heartburn were randomized to either placebo (n = 196) or cisapride 20 mg (n = 202) twice daily for 4 wk. Compared with placebo, cisapride significantly reduced scores for daytime and nighttime heartburn (p < 0.001), total regurgitation (p < 0.001), eructation (p = 0.04), and early satiety (p = 0.04). was also superior to placebo in reducing total use of rescue antacid medication (p < 0.001); reducing, in concordance analyses, daytime and nighttime heartburn with antacid usage (p < 0.001); increasing the percentage of heartburn-free days and antacid-free nights (p < 0.5); and increasing the percentage of patients self-rated as having minimal or better symptomatic improvement (p = 0.01).</s><s>The purpose of this study was to assess the rapidity of symptom relief and 4-week efficacy of rabeprazole 20 mg in patients with moderately severe nonerosive gastroesophageal reflux disease. Data were analyzed from 2 similarly designed, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, U.S. trials. Median time to first 24-hour heartburn-free interval was 3.5 days for the rabeprazole group compared with 19.5 days for the placebo group (P < or = .0002).</s><s>To compare the effects and tolerability of omeprazole and cisapride with that of placebo for control of heartburn in primary care patients. 483 untreated patients with complaints of heartburn >/=3 days a week, with at most grade 1 reflux oesophagitis. Omeprazole 20 mg once daily, cisapride 20 mg twice daily, or placebo for 8 weeks. Adequate control of heartburn, defined as </=1 day of the past 7 days with no more than mild heartburn, after 4 weeks of treatment. Antacid use was 2-3 times greater in patients taking cisapride or placebo than in those taking omeprazole. Significantly more patients taking cisapride reported adverse events than those taking omeprazole or placebo.</s><s>Data are limited on the value of effective antisecretory therapy in the relief of heartburn in patients without oesophagitis. Patients with heartburn, without endoscopic signs of oesophagitis, were randomized to double-blind treatment with omeprazole, 20 or 10 mg once daily, or placebo, for 4 weeks (n = 509). Pre-treatment oesophageal acid exposure was assessed using 24-h intra-oesophageal pH monitoring. Omeprazole, 20 and 10 mg once daily, provides rapid relief of heartburn in patients without endoscopic oesophagitis.</s><s>Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a prevalent disease associated with a high symptom burden and a reduced quality of life. The patients [338 intention-to-treat (ITT) population; 284 per-protocol (PP) population] received 20 mg pantoprazole (once daily in the morning) plus ranitidine placebo (once daily in the evening; ITT n = 167, PP n = 136) or pantoprazole placebo (once daily in the morning) plus 300 mg ranitidine (once daily in the evening; ITT n = 171, PP n = 148) for 28 days. Significantly more pantoprazole-treated patients were free from key GERD symptoms at day 28 (68.3%, n = 114) as compared with ranitidine-treated patients (43.3%, n = 74; 95% confidence interval for odds ratio 1.84-4.51). Pantoprazole was also significantly more efficacious in controlling all gastrointestinal symptoms of GERD.</s><s>Evidence suggests that rates of gastroesophageal reflux disease are increasing in the Asia-Pacific region, where patients tend to have predominantly non-erosive reflux disease as opposed to erosive (reflux) esophagitis. At present, data for the responsiveness of non-erosive reflux disease to proton pump inhibition are scant. We aimed to study esomeprazole for the treatment of non-erosive reflux disease in Chinese patients. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux, and a locally validated reflux index, the Chinese GerdQ, of equal to or greater than 12 were recruited and randomized to receive esomeprazole 20 mg daily or placebo for 8 weeks. There were no statistically significant differences in overall quality-of-life measures or the HAD scale related to treatment.</s><s>To investigate whether pantoprazole (20 mg/d) produces significantly greater symptom control than ranitidine (300 mg/d) in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). Patient-assessed frequency and severity of heartburn using the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) and a patient heartburn diary.</s><s>There are few data on empiric, stepped therapy for heartburn relief or subsequent relapse in primary care. Daily diaries documented heartburn relief (score < or = 3/7 on < or = of 7 prior days) and relapse (score > or = 4 on > or = 2 of 7 prior days). For 'proton pump inhibitor-start' (n = 196) vs. 'H2-receptor antagonist-start' (n = 194), respectively, heartburn relief occurred in 55.1% vs. 27.3% (P < 0.001) at 4 weeks and in 88.3% vs. 87.1% at 16 weeks. An empiric 'proton pump inhibitor-start' strategy relieves heartburn more effectively than an 'H2-receptor antagonist-start' strategy up to 12 weeks but has no effect on subsequent relapse, which is rapid in most patients.</s><s>Few studies have specifically addressed the management of the symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, and there are no comparative data in this respect for acid pump inhibitors and prokinetic agents. Patients still experiencing heartburn continued therapy for a further 4 weeks and the assessments were repeated. Both omeprazole doses were significantly more effective than cisapride (P < 0.01). Regurgitation and epigastric pain also improved to a greater degree with omeprazole than with cisapride. Omeprazole 20 or 10 mg once daily is significantly more effective than cisapride in the resolution of heartburn, regardless of the presence of erosive oesophagitis, and this is accompanied by an improvement in patient quality of life.</s><s>One hundred and twenty-five patients with symptoms of heartburn and acid regurgitation but without endoscopic abnormalities were randomized to receive 200 mg cimetidine suspension four times daily or placebo for two weeks. It is concluded that placebo suspension has a considerable effect on gastro-oesophageal reflux disease symptoms, but cimetidine suspension provides significantly better relief.</s><s>We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial comparing the efficacy of famotidine 40 mg administered at bedtime (HS), 20 mg given twice daily (BID), and placebo to relieve heartburn and to heal endoscopically documented esophageal erosions or ulcerations. In the group given famotidine 20 mg BID, there was a significantly greater proportion of patients with complete relief of daytime heartburn, and both famotidine groups demonstrated statistically significant advantages over placebo in global scores or by successful outcome.</s><s>To assess symptom relief in patients with heartburn following treatment with esomeprazole 40 mg daily. Heartburn symptoms were recorded daily; as insufficient patients had data available from days 13 and 14, analyses included data up to day 12. 240 patients had erosive esophagitis (EO) and 114 patients had GERD defined by pH-monitoring. Total heartburn relief occurred in 67%-73%, 62%-70%, and 21%-32% of patients in the esomeprazole 40 mg o.d., esomeprazole 20 mg b.i.d., and placebo groups, respectively, between days 6 and 12. Figures for patients diagnosed by pH-monitoring were 65%-73% of those with a positive diagnosis and 51%-58% with a negative diagnosis. Once-daily esomeprazole 40 mg dosing is recommended as no advantage was gained by splitting the dose.</s><s>Cimetidine, metoclopramide, or placebo in the treatment of symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux.</s><s>To determine the diagnostic value of empirical treatment with omeprazole in the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Patients with symptoms suggestive of GERD underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and 24-h esophageal pH monitoring. The effect of treatment was evaluated after 1 and 2 wk with a symptom questionnaire with a four-grade Likert scale, and symptomatic response outcome was compared with the results of 24-h pH-metry. Ninety-eight patients were included; however, 13 were excluded from the final analysis because of protocol violation. The pH registration showed pathological gastroesophageal reflux in 47 patients (55%). With pH-metry as the gold standard, the omeprazole test had positive and negative predictive values of 68% and 63%, respectively, for the diagnosis of GERD.</s><s>The effectiveness of cimetidine for symptomatic relief in patients with chronic gastroesophageal reflux was studied in a multicenter, double blind clinical trial. Throughout the trial, frequent assessments were made of symptom severity and frequency, combined with careful measurement of antacid use. Significant (P less than 0.05) decreases in symptom frequency and severity were noted throughout the study in the cimetidine-treated patients, as compared with the placebo group. In addition, significant improvement in esophageal acid sensitivity resulted from cimetidine therapy.</s><s>The proportion of patients who respond to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy is about 20% lower in those with non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) than in those with erosive oesophagitis. To assess efficacy and safety of dexlansoprazole MR, a PPI using Dual Delayed Release technology, in NERD patients. In this 4-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 947 NERD patients randomly received dexlansoprazole MR 30 mg, 60 mg or placebo once daily (QD). Patients completed validated quality of life and symptom severity questionnaires.</s><s>Patients with chronic heartburn but with no endoscopic evidence of erosive oesophagitis require gastric acid suppression to relieve symptoms. To assess the efficacy and safety of esomeprazole in patients with frequent heartburn for >or = 6 months and no evidence of erosive oesophagitis on endoscopy. Patients treated with either dose of esomeprazole were two to three times more likely to achieve complete resolution of heartburn than patients treated with placebo (P < 0.001). The spectrum and frequency of adverse events with esomeprazole were similar to those with placebo.</s><s>In a multicenter, double-blind trial, 284 patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease were evaluated before, during, and after six weeks of treatment with either placebo or ranitidine (150 mg twice daily). Ranitidine treatment was significantly more effective than placebo treatment in decreasing the frequency and the severity of heartburn during both daytime and nighttime assessment periods. Among patients with endoscopic esophagitis at baseline, the overall change in endoscopic classification after six weeks of therapy was significantly better for the ranitidine-treated patients.</s><s>Several studies in Western countries showed that proton-pump inhibitors are superior to histamine2-receptor antagonists or placebo in the treatment of non-erosive gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Frequency of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease symptoms and health-related quality of life were evaluated at baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment. Complete relief was defined as no gastro-oesophageal reflux disease symptoms during the 7-day interval in week 4. Complete relief was achieved in 23 (48%) of patients receiving famotidine and 28 (56%) of patients treated with omeprazole. Omeprazole is more effective than famotidine for the control of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease symptoms in H. pylori-negative patients, while similar efficacy is observed in H. pylori-positive patients with non-erosive gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.</s><s>The efficacy of omeprazole, 20 mg once daily, in the treatment of reflux oesophagitis and the therapeutic advantages over the histamine H2 receptor antagonists are well documented. Symptom relief after 4 weeks was achieved by 61% (OM20), 49% (OM10), and 40% (RAN) patients (OM20 versus OM10, P < 0.0167; OM20 versus RAN, P < 0.0001; OM10 versus RAN, P < 0.01). Among the patients (32%) with erosive reflux oesophagitis, symptom relief was achieved in 79% (OM20), 48% (OM10), and 33% (RAN) (OM20 versus OM10, P < 0.0001; OM20 versus RAN, P < 0.0001; OM1O versus RAN, NS). Omeprazole, 20 mg, is the most effective initial therapy for relief of GORD symptoms.</s><s>Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), often characterized as heartburn, is a highly common presenting complaint to family physicians. This study is the first large, prospective, nationwide family practice outpatient evaluation of the effectiveness of the histamine (H2)-receptor antagonist ranitidine as medical therapy for this disorder. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, 6-week study was designed to evaluate the effect of ranitidine on clinical outcomes and quality of life in patients with GERD. These reductions were maintained throughout the 6-week trial, during both daytime and nighttime. Further, both ranitidine-treated patients' and their physicians' global assessments of decreases in heartburn severity, as well as clinical improvement on ranitidine, proved superior to those of controls (P < or = .001). Ranitidine-treated patients had more favorable scores on the general health status dimensions of physical functioning, bodily pain, and vitality (P < .05), and more favorable scores on all dimensions of the heartburn-specific questionnaire (P < .05). Twice-daily treatment with ranitidine 150 mg is a valuable therapy for GERD in a typical family practice setting.</s><s>To assess intermittent treatment over 12 months in patients with symptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Patients who were symptomatic or mildly symptomatic were followed up for 12 months. Recurrences of moderate or severe heartburn during follow up were treated with the dose which was successful for initial symptom control. Total time off active treatment, time to failure of intermittent treatment, and outcomes ranked from best to worst. According to outcome, 378 (72%) patients were in the best outcome ranks (no relapse or one (or more) relapse but in remission until 12 months); 630 (93%) had three or fewer relapses in the intermittent treatment phase. It is simple and applicable in general practice, where most patients are seen.</s><s>To assess the efficacy of omeprazole in patients presenting with troublesome reflux symptoms. Patients not symptom-free at 4 weeks received open treatment with Ome20 once daily for a further 4 weeks. Complete upper GI symptom relief during week 4 on Ome20 or Ome10 in patients with or without endoscopic oesophagitis. Complete relief during week 4 was reported by 19% of endoscopy-negative patients on placebo, and sufficient control by 35%. After 6 months off treatment, 90% of patients with oesophagitis and 75% of endoscopy-negative patients reported symptomatic relapse. After cessation of treatment, symptomatic relapse was rapid and frequent in both endoscopy-positive and endoscopy-negative patients.</s><s>There is increasing awareness of nonerosive reflux disease (NERD) as a disease requiring treatment in Japan. Overall, 355 patients were enrolled, of whom 284 were randomly assigned to one of the three groups (omeprazole 10 mg, n = 96; omeprazole 20 mg, n = 93; placebo, n = 95). Omeprazole 10 mg or 20 mg once daily is effective and well tolerated in patients with NERD regardless of their endoscopic classification.</s><s>Since metoclopramide increases lower-esophageal-sphincter pressure in patients with gastroesophageal reflux, we compared the effects of metoclopramide, 10 mg four times daily, with those of placebo on symptoms in 31 patients with chronic heartburn. Eighteen patients completed a random-order, double-blind crossover study of two consecutive eight-week periods. After the metoclopramide treatment period, mean basal pressure was unchanged from values before study. In both treatment periods, metoclopramide-treated patients had significantly more symptomatic improvement than the control group (P less than 0.05).</s><s>Previous studies have demonstrated greater efficacy for omeprazole compared with cimetidine in patients with endoscopically verified oesophagitis, but excluded the substantial group of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) patients with reflux symptoms but without endoscopic abnormality. Those still symptomatic after 4 weeks of treatment received omeprazole 20 mg daily for a further 4 weeks. There was no correlation between severity of heartburn and endoscopic grade at entry (correlation coefficient = 0.196). After 4 weeks of treatment, the proportion of patients in whom heartburn was controlled (no more than mild symptoms on no more than 1 day in the previous 7) on omeprazole (66%; 74/112) was more than double that on cimetidine (31%; 34/109) (P < 0.0001). There was no significant difference between the relief of heartburn in the 47% of patients without unequivocal oesophagitis (endoscopic grade 0 or 1) and in the 53% of patients with erosive oesophagitis (grade 2 or 3) (P = 0.31). Amongst those patients requiring an additional 4 weeks of treatment with omeprazole, 67% (54/81) reported that their heartburn was controlled after 8 weeks of treatment.</s><s>As many as 50% of patients with reflux symptoms have no endoscopic evidence of oesophagitis. Symptoms were assessed at clinic visits and using daily diary cards, with patient-completed questionnaires providing additional data on symptoms and on psychological disturbance. Fewer patients in the omeprazole group required alginate/antacid relief medication (P < 0.05). Symptom relief (time to first heartburn-free day) was more rapid with omeprazole (2 vs. 5 days on placebo; P < 0.01). Omeprazole 20 mg once daily is effective in providing relief of the symptoms typical of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in patients with essentially normal oesophageal mucosa.</s><s>The effect of 150 mg ranitidine twice daily was compared with placebo by the double-blind crossover technique (8 weeks twice) in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux (paired comparison in 38 patients). The symptomatic response to ranitidine was, however, unsatisfactory in more than half of the cases. When symptomatic responders taking ranitidine (R) were compared with non-responders (NR), there was no difference with regard to the severity of oesophagitis or frequency of positive acid perfusion tests before or after the 8-week treatment.</s><s>Traditionally, proton pump inhibitors are used primarily for patients with esophagitis. In 2 randomized, double-blind, multicenter trials of 901 patients with symptomatic reflux disease, which was confirmed by endoscopy to be nonerosive, received lansoprazole, 15 or 30 mg once daily; ranitidine, 150 mg twice daily; or placebo for 8 weeks. The incidence of possible or probable treatment-related adverse reactions was comparable among the treatment groups; abdominal pain and diarrhea were the most commonly reported adverse events. No statistically significant differences were noted between treatment groups in laboratory analyses.</s><s>Up to three quarters of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) have symptoms, such as heartburn, but no macroscopic evidence of erosive esophagitis, making symptomatic GERD a common clinical problem in the primary care setting. Patients with a history of heartburn (> or =12 months) and episodes of moderate to severe heartburn on 4 or more of the 7 days before endoscopy were eligible to participate in this 4-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Of 359 randomized patients, 355 were included in the statistical analysis (intention-to-treat population). Complete resolution of heartburn every day during the last treatment week was significantly (P< or =.002) higher in the 20-mg omeprazole group (48%) than in the 10-mg omeprazole (27%) or placebo (5%) group. Omeprazole was significantly (P< or =.003) more effective than placebo for the treatment of acid regurgitation, dysphagia, epigastric pain, and nausea. Patients with symptomatic GERD require profound acid suppression to achieve symptomatic relief. Omeprazole, 20 mg once daily, was superior to omeprazole, 10 mg once daily, and to placebo in providing early and sustained resolution of heartburn, as well as treatment of other troublesome GERD symptoms.</s><s>This study was performed to study the demography, effect of treatment with ranitidine and relapse pattern in patients with reflux symptoms. After four weeks medication was stopped and satisfied patients were followed for 24 weeks. At two weeks there was no significant difference between placebo and ranitidine, regarding the proportion of patients with complete relief from symptoms or satisfied with treatment. offered no additional advantage in weeks three to four over prolonging treatment with 150 mg b.i.d.</s>"

Urodynamic analysis (including cystometrogram), provocative stress test, and behavioral assessment revealed that the nursing home patients were severely debilitated, with 65% demonstrating bladder abnormalities, 87% incapable of independent toileting, and 25% failing to score on the Mini-Mental Status Exam (average score, 8.0). The treatment procedures were evaluated with a multiple baseline design in which subjects were randomly divided into immediate or delayed treatment groups after a baseline observation period. During treatment, the frequency of incontinence per 12 hours changed from a baseline average of 3.85 to a treatment average of 1.91.</s><s>One hundred thirty-three incontinent women in seven nursing homes were assigned randomly to a 13-week behavior therapy program for urinary incontinence or to a control group that received usual incontinence-related care. This reduction in the number of wet episodes was statistically significant, both with respect to this group's baseline levels of incontinence and in comparison with the performance of the control women. The number of wet episodes in the control group remained about the same throughout training and the 22-week follow-up period.</s><s>A behavioral management system designed to reduce urinary incontinence was evaluated in two nursing homes with a pretest-posttest control group design with repeated measures. The frequency of correct toileting for experimental subjects increased by approximately 45%.</s><s>To determine whether an intervention that combines low-intensity exercise and incontinence care offsets some of its costs by reducing the incidence of selected health conditions in nursing home residents. Randomized, controlled trial with the incidence and costs of selected, acute conditions compared between a 6-month baseline and an 8-month intervention phase. Predefined acute conditions hypothesized to be related to physical inactivity, incontinence, or immobility were abstracted from residents' medical records by blinded observers during a 6-month baseline period and throughout the 8-month intervention. Conditions included those in the dermatological, genitourinary, gastrointestinal, respiratory and cardiovascular systems; falls; pain; and psychiatric and nutritional disturbances. There were no significant differences between groups in the cost of assessing and treating these acute conditions between baseline and intervention. The intervention, which is consistent with federal and clinical practice guidelines, significantly improved functional outcomes but did not reduce the incidence and costs of selected acute health conditions.</s><s>To test the effects of a rehabilitative intervention directed at continence, mobility, endurance, and strength (Functional Incidental Training (FIT)) in older patients in Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) nursing homes. Trained research staff provided the FIT intervention, which included prompted voiding combined with individualized, functionally oriented endurance and strength-training exercises offered four times per day, 5 days per week, for 8 weeks. Group 1 received the intervention while Group 2 served as a control group; then Group 2 received the intervention while Group 1 crossed over to no intervention. There was a significant effect of the FIT intervention on virtually all measures of endurance, strength, and urinary incontinence but not on the FIM for locomotion or toileting. FIT improves endurance, strength, and urinary incontinence in older patients residing in VA nursing homes.</s><s>The objective of this study was to examine the short-term effectiveness of prompted voiding (PV) in cognitively impaired homebound older adults. Nineteen cognitively impaired older adults were randomly assigned to either the PV intervention or a usual care attention control group. Nineteen subjects were randomly assigned to a PV (n = 9) or delayed attention-control group (n = 10). Treatment subjects with complete pretreatment and posttreatment data (n = 6) experienced a mean 60% reduction in daytime incontinent episodes compared with a mean 37% reduction among control subjects (n = 10).

There was a marked improvement of pain symptoms during the treatment in the patients of both groups. The repeat laparoscopy did not reveal significant differences between the two groups in the reduction of the disease extent. Eighteen months after treatment suspension, the cumulative pregnancy rate was 33% in the patients treated with gestrinone and 40% in those treated with danazol.</s><s>To assess whether hormonal treatment of endometriosis improves quality of life for women with endometriosis. The distribution of the studied parameters were tested by means of a Skewness test. It was noticeable that anxiety-depression and sleep disturbances were significantly more common among the drop outs. There was a significant reduction in symptom score during the study, without any significant difference between the treatment groups. There was a statistically significant improvement of paid working life in the nafarelin treated group. All the other psycho-social parameters as well as emotional balance improved during the study period without difference between groups. When hormonal treatment is planned it is very important to take into consideration previous psychosocial experiences of the patient.</s><s>Our purpose was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate versus an oral contraceptive combined with very-low-dose danazol in the long-term treatment of pelvic pain in women with endometriosis. The women were asked to grade the degree of their satisfaction at the end of therapy. A significant decrease was observed in all symptom scores in both study groups. Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate seems to be an effective, safe, and convenient low-cost treatment for pelvic pain associated with endometriosis.</s><s>To compare dydrogesterone with placebos in the treatment of minimal to mild endometriosis. Sixty-two premenopausal women with complaints of pain (n = 12) and infertility with or without pain (n = 50) with minimal to mild endometriosis diagnosed at laparoscopy. Thirty-nine women had a laparoscopy after treatment and 56 women were followed up 12 months after treatment. Treatment with dydrogesterone did not alter the natural history of endometriosis or PRs when compared with placebo.</s><s>The purpose of this randomized double blind prospective trial was to study the efficacy and safety of two doses of oral gestrinone in the treatment of endometriosis.

This study suggests that oral gestrinone 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg twice weekly is efficacious and safe in the treatment of endometriosis.</s><s>Dienogest is a selective progestin that has been investigated in a clinical trial programme for the treatment of endometriosis. The current non-inferiority trial compared the efficacy and safety of dienogest against leuprolide acetate (LA) for treating the pain associated with endometriosis. The primary efficacy variable was absolute change in pelvic pain from baseline to end of treatment, assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS). As expected, bleeding episodes were suppressed less with dienogest than with LA. Changes in mean lumbar BMD between screening and final visit were +0.25% with dienogest and -4.04% with LA subgroups (P = 0.0003).</s><s>To assess the effect of a new progestin progestogen only pill (desogestrel) versus an oral contraceptive in the treatment of recurrent endometriosis. A group of women with endometriosis (n=40) who showed recurrent dysmenorrhea and/or pelvic pain after conservative surgery, and did not desire a pregnancy. Continuous treatment for 6 months with desogestrel (75 microg/d) (n=20) versus a combined oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol 20 microg plus desogestrel 150 microg) (n=20) was performed. Both desogestrel and an oral estro-progestinic were effective, safe and low cost therapy of pain symptoms after endoscopic surgery for endometriosis, the former showing an impact on breakthrough bleeding, the later an incidence on body weight increase.</s><s>In a large, double-blind, multicentre study, 269 patients with confirmed endometriosis were randomly allocated to receive either danazol (200 mg twice daily; n = 137) or gestrinone (2.5 mg twice weekly; n = 132) for 6 months. Clinical assessment, haematological and biochemical investigations were carried out during the 6 months of treatment and for a further 12 months' follow-up and are compared between the two groups. A total of 15 patients from the gestrinone group, including four patients with hirsutism, and 17 patients from the danazol group, including six patients with headache, withdrew because of adverse symptoms.

We therefore conducted a randomized trial to determine whether induction chemotherapy before irradiation improves survival. Eligibility requirements included excellent performance status, minimal weight loss, and visible disease on radiography. Patients assigned to group 2 received the same radiation therapy but began it immediately and received no chemotherapy. The median survival was greater for those in group 1-13.8 versus 9.7 months (P = 0.0066 by log-rank test). Those in group 1 had a higher incidence of serious infections requiring hospitalization (7 percent, vs. 3 percent in group 2) and severe weight loss (14 percent vs. 6 percent), but there were no treatment-related deaths.</s><s>The 15-year findings are presented of a double-blind, randomised study planned in 1964 in which cytotoxic chemotherapy with either busulphan or cyclophosphamide prescribed to be given daily for 2 years as an adjuvant to surgery was compared with placebo in the treatment of 726 patients with carcinoma of the bronchus. The two cytotoxic agents administered in this way did not influence survival. Survival was significantly shorter in patients with histological involvement of the resected intrathoracic nodes (log-rank test P much less than 0.001). A finding of particular interest is that the histological type of the tumour did not influence survival in the 390 patients whose nodes were not involved, although, as expected, it did in the 336 whose nodes were involved, the 226 with epidermoid cancers surviving longer than the 57 with small cell carcinoma, the 31 with adenocarcinoma and all 110 with non-epidermoid carcinomas (P much less than 0.001 in each comparison).</s><s>The aims of this study were to assess the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy on overall survival, disease-free survival, and relapse pattern, as well as its toxicity in patients who underwent radical surgery for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). After 10 years from the start of the study, 61% of patients were alive in the chemotherapy group and 48% were alive in the control group (P = .050). The 5-year survival rate was 67% in the chemotherapy group and was 56% in the control group (P = .050).

Some patients could not have surgery because of coexisting medical conditions. Patients were randomly assigned to receive vindesine, 3 mg/m2 body surface area weekly; standard thoracic radiotherapy, 60 Gy over 6 weeks; or both vindesine and thoracic radiotherapy. Patients who developed progressive disease while receiving vindesine or radiotherapy alone were crossed over to radiotherapy or vindesine, respectively. Patients with non-small cell lung cancer who have inoperable, nonmetastatic disease gain no clinically meaningful survival advantage with immediate thoracic irradiation, even when modern megavoltage radiation therapy techniques and equipment are used.</s><s>Patients with TNM stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer have short survival times. The present trial was designed to assess the safety and the effect on survival of supportive care alone versus chemotherapy with cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, and mitomycin combined with appropriate supportive care in patients with stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer. Patients (n = 102) with stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer were randomly assigned to one of two treatment regimens. Mean weekly delivered doses of drugs were as follows: cisplatin, 22.1 mg/m2; cyclophosphamide, 118 mg/m2; and mitomycin, 2.9 mg/m2. Toxic effects due to chemotherapy were generally mild, but peripheral neuropathy and hematologic and renal toxic effects were observed. In the supportive care group, mean survival was 6.1 months (median, 4.0 months); six patients lived at least 12 months and two lived at least 18 months. In the combined modality group, mean survival was 11.3 months (median, 8.5 months); 20 patients lived at least 12 months, 13 lived at least 18 months, and five lived at least 24 months. Although the results of the present study are encouraging, clinical research should continue to be directed toward developing more effective treatments for this disease.</s><s>In 1976, the Southwest Oncology Group activated a four-arm randomized study of limited squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Of the 107 eligible patients, 15 (14%) had complete responses and 20 (19%) had partial responses.

To study this question, the National Cancer Institute of Canada (NCIC) Clinical Trials Group conducted a prospective randomized trial comparing best supportive care (BSC) to two chemotherapy regimens, vindesine and cisplatin (VP), and cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (CAP). Between February 1983 and January 1986, 23 centers across Canada entered 251 patients on study. Patients had measurable or evaluable disease, with either distant metastases (82.5%) or bulky limited disease considered inoperable or unsuitable for radical radiotherapy. The treatment groups were comparable in terms of age, sex, performance status, histology, disease extent, and weight loss.

A total of 121 patients were enrolled in the study, of whom 7 (5.8%) were ineligible. Chemotherapy was followed by identical thoracic radiotherapy 4 weeks after the second cycle of chemotherapy. Patients who had progression of disease after chest irradiation only were treated with MACC chemotherapy. Major clinical responses were observed in 31 of 56 (55%; 95% Cl, 42% to 68%) patients treated with combination therapy and 37 of 58 (64%; Cl, 51% to 76%) treated with radiation only (P greater than 0.2). The median time to progression was 192 days with radiotherapy only compared with 199 days for combined modality therapy (P greater than 0.2). The 1-, 2-, and 5-year survival rates after thoracic radiation only were 45% (Cl, 32% to 58%), 16% (Cl, 6% to 25%), and 7%.

Neither the incidence of death with metastases, metastasis-free survival (MFS) nor overall survival (S) were significantly affected by treatment with the drug. During long-term therapy with VLB, mild polyneuropathy developed in the majority of patients in group B. Furthermore, seven patients discontinued treatment with VLB during maintenance due to compliance (4) and excessive neurotoxicity (3).</s><s>Eighty-two patients with histologically confirmed lung cancer were randomly allocated to receive either radiotherapy alone (2400-3200 rads, depending upon cell type) or the same dose of radiotherapy followed by four cycles of adriamycin and 5-fluorouracil.</s><s>Between June 1980 and December 1983, 111 patients with inoperable epidermoid bronchogenic carcinoma (limited disease) were entered into a randomized trial comparing radiotherapy alone versus radiotherapy and combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin (doxorubicin), methotrexate, and procarbazine. Thirty-five of 62 (56.4%) patients treated with 4500 rad in 15 fractions in 3 weeks and 19 of 49 (38.8%) patients treated with the same radiation treatment and chemotherapy had an objective response. Median survival was 11.74 and 10.03 months, respectively, without statistically significant differences between the two groups of patients. The toxicity was acceptable and no treatment-related death occurred in either treatment schedule.</s><s>Current chemotherapy treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer has demonstrated some objective responses, but is still largely palliative. Although the patients receiving combination chemotherapy had a slightly longer median survival (20.43 weeks versus 13.57 weeks), it was not statistically significant (P = 0.09). The authors conclude that contemporary combination chemotherapy provides only modest survival benefit to patients with advanced metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and should not be considered standard therapy.</s><s>The treatment results of radiotherapy in stage III non-small-cell lung cancer are very poor. Several phase II studies showed that neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy was feasible in this patient group and suggested that treatment outcome might improve. In the combined arm a third CT cycle was planned during the split between RT courses. After completion of treatment 7 patients had a complete response (2 in the CT plus RT arm, 5 in the RT alone arm) and 26 patients a partial response (13 in the CT plus RT arm, 13 in the RT alone arm) for an overall response rate of 52% (95% CI 39%-65%).

No treatment benefit was associated with adjuvant chemotherapy in this trial.</s><s>Most studies of adjuvant chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or immunotherapy in non-small-cell lung cancer patients with complete surgical resection of disease have shown negative results. However, two studies of stage II and III disease by our Lung Cancer Study Group suggested an advantage to adjuvant therapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (CAP). After complete resection, eligible patients with stage I disease were classified by known prognostic factors and randomly assigned to receive or not to receive four courses of CAP at 3-week intervals beginning on day 30 after surgery. Stratification by prognostic factors was as follows: histology (squamous versus nonsquamous), white blood cell count before surgery (> or = 9100/mm3 versus < 9100/mm3), and Karnofsky performance status before surgery (< or = 90% versus 100%). Of the 269 patients entered in the study, 101 had recurrence and 127 have died. There was one treatment-related death on the CAP arm due to infection during neutropenia.

Median survival was 34.3 weeks (range, 4.3 to 218.6+ weeks) in arm A versus 21.1 weeks (range, 4.3 to 188.6 weeks) in arm B; the difference was not significant at P = .153 (Mantel-Cox). Poor-risk patients (at least two of the following: poor performance status, stage M1, weight loss) of arm A survived significantly longer than poor-risk patients of arm B (23.6 weeks v 12.4 weeks, Mantel-Cox P = .008); a significant difference in survival was also observed between nonsquamous cell patients of arm A and those of arm B (median survival, 38.6 weeks v 16.7 weeks; Mantel-Cox P = .041). Our alternating treatment was not significantly superior to supportive care.</s><s>A prospective randomized trial (the second cooperative study) was conducted from July 1985 to December 1987 to investigate the benefits of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy in patients for whom non-small cell lung cancer had been resected completely. Three hundred and nine cases were eligible: 155 cases in group A (p-Stage I 93, II 19, III 43) and 154 in group B (I 109, II 10, III 35). There were no significant differences in the 5-year survival between the two groups. However, since a significant difference was observed between the two groups regarding pathological lymph node metastasis (pN), the prognostic factors were adjusted using Cox's proportional hazard model.</s><s>Eight hundred sixty-five patients with a microscopically curative resection for carcinoma of the lung were accepted for study, none of whom were excluded from analysis.

A total of 259 patients were included: 132 were observed according to the simple strategy and 127 were observed according to the intensive strategy. Both groups were similar with respect to baseline characteristics and rate and type of tumor recurrence. However, the intensive strategy was associated with higher overall survival in patients with stage II tumors (HR = 0.34; 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.98; P = .045) and in those with rectal lesions (HR = 0.09; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.81; P = .03), mainly due to higher rate of resectability for recurrent tumors.

Between 1981 and 1987, 167 children aged 3-16 years, who had had at least two previously untreated tonic-clonic or partial seizures, with or without secondary generalisation, were randomly allocated treatment with phenobarbitone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, or sodium valproate. 20% of children remained free of seizures and 73% had achieved 1-year remission by 3 years of follow-up. The overall frequency of unacceptable side-effects necessitating withdrawal of the randomised drug was 9%.</s><s>Recent studies have shown that most newly diagnosed epileptic patients can be satisfactorily treated with a single antiepileptic drug. We therefore undertook a prospective randomised pragmatic trial of the comparative efficacy and toxicity of four major antiepileptic drugs, utilised as monotherapy in newly diagnosed epileptic patients. Between 1981 and 1987 243 adult patients aged 16 years or over, newly referred to two district general hospitals with a minimum of two previously untreated tonic-clonic or partial with or without secondary generalised seizures were randomly allocated to treatment with phenobarbitone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, or sodium valproate. No significant differences between the four drugs were found for either measure of efficacy at one, two, or three years of follow up. The overall incidence of unacceptable side effects, necessitating withdrawal of the randomised drug, was 10%.</s><s>The use of phenobarbital for childhood epilepsy is controversial because of reported behavioural side-effects; however, whether this research can validly be extrapolated to developing countries is not clear.

In comparison to placebo, no proarrhythmogenic effect of pimobendan was detected.</s><s>The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of flosequinan in chronic heart failure. Flosequinan is a new vasodilator drug that acts by interfering with the inositol-triphosphate/protein kinase C pathway, an important mechanism of vasoconstriction. The drug dilates both peripheral arteries and veins, is orally active and has a long duration of action that permits once-daily dosing. One hundred ninety-three patients with chronic heart failure (New York Heart Association functional class II or III and left ventricular ejection fraction < 40%) receiving digoxin and diuretic drugs were randomly assigned (double-blind) to the addition of flosequinan (100 mg once daily, n = 93) or placebo (n = 100) for 3 months. The clinical status and exercise tolerance of each patient was evaluated at the start of the study and every 2 to 4 weeks during the trial while background therapy remained constant. Symptomatically, 55% of patients receiving flosequinan but only 36% of patients receiving placebo benefited from treatment (p = 0.018).</s><s>The long-term beneficial effects of pimobendan in the treatment of chronic heart failure (CHF) have not been established, so the present trial compared pimobendan (1.25 or 2.5mg twice daily) vs placebo in 306 patients with stable New York Heart Association class IIm or III CHF, and a radionuclide or echocardiographic left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < or =45% despite optimal treatment with conventional therapy, for up to 52 weeks in a double-blind protocol. At the end of the 52 weeks of treatment, combined adverse cardiac events had occurred in 19 patients in the pimobendan group (15.9%) vs 33 patients in the placebo group (26.3%). Treatment with pimobendan also increased the mean Specific Activity Scale score from 4.39+/-0.12 at baseline to 4.68+/-0.15 at 52 weeks (p<0.05).

Drugs that improve symptoms in severe end stage heart failure should not be discarded lightly.</s><s>Milrinone, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, enhances cardiac contractility by increasing intracellular levels of cyclic AMP, but the long-term effect of this type of positive inotropic agent on the survival of patients with chronic heart failure has not been determined. In addition, all patients received conventional therapy with digoxin, diuretics, and a converting-enzyme inhibitor throughout the trial. As compared with placebo, milrinone therapy was associated with a 28 percent increase in mortality from all causes (95 percent confidence interval, 1 to 61 percent; P = 0.038) and a 34 percent increase in cardiovascular mortality (95 percent confidence interval, 6 to 69 percent; P = 0.016).</s><s>This study was designed to evaluate the effects of low-dose enoximone on exercise capacity. The effects of lower doses of enoximone on exercise capacity and adverse events have not been evaluated. By the protocol-specified method of statistical analysis (the last observation carried-forward method), enoximone at 50 mg three times a day improved exercise capacity by 117 s at 12 weeks (p = 0.003). Enoximone at 25 mg three times a day also improved exercise capacity at 12 weeks by 115 s (p = 0.013). Effects on degree of dyspnea and patient and physician assessments of clinical status favored the enoximone groups. Twelve weeks of treatment with low-dose enoximone improves exercise capacity in patients with CHF, without increasing adverse events.</s><s>To determine the effects of pimobendan 2.5 and 5 mg daily on exercise capacity in patients with chronic heart failure. A randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial of the addition of pimobendan to conventional treatment with a minimum follow up of 24 weeks. At that time 63% of patients allocated to pimobendan and 59% of those allocated to placebo were alive and able to exercise to at least the same level as at entry (P = 0.5). Pimobendan improves exercise capacity in patients with chronic heart failure who are also on conventional treatment.

The aetiology and diuretic requirement of patients may influence their response to treatment.</s><s>In a parallel study design, 164 patients with New York Heart Association Functional class II or III heart failure were randomized to receive either enoximone given as 50 mg three times a day, or 100 mg three times a day, or a matching placebo. Left ventricular ejection fraction increased significantly after the first dose of enoximone but not after 12 weeks of long-term therapy. Heart failure symptoms and the physicians' evaluations of cardiac status were significantly improved in both enoximone therapy groups during the first 4 weeks of evaluation when compared with evaluations of cardiac status in the placebo group. Diuretic doses were increased more frequently for patients who were receiving a placebo. Mean heart rate and ventricular ectopic activity were not significantly different among the three treatment limbs. Heart rate, ventricular ectopic activity, and mortality rate were not increased.</s><s>Vesnarinone, an inotropic drug, was shown in a short-term placebo-controlled trial to improve survival markedly in patients with severe heart failure when given at a dose of 60 mg per day, but there was a trend toward an adverse effect on survival when the dose was 120 mg per day. In a longer-term study, we evaluated the effects of daily doses of 60 mg or 30 mg of vesnarinone, as compared with placebo, on mortality and morbidity. We enrolled 3833 patients who had symptoms of New York Heart Association class III or IV heart failure and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30 percent or less despite optimal treatment. The quality of life had improved significantly more in the 60-mg vesnarinone group than in the placebo group at 8 weeks (P<0.001) and 16 weeks (P=0.003) after randomization. Vesnarinone is associated with a dose-dependent increase in mortality among patients with severe heart failure, an increase that is probably related to an increase in deaths due to arrhythmia.</s><s>A 12-week, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of imazodan, a type III phosphodiesterase inhibitor, was conducted in 147 patients with congestive heart failure to determine clinical efficacy and safety. Patients were maintained on their standard therapy including diuretics, digoxin and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. There was no significant difference observed between the placebo group and any of the treated groups with regard to exercise time, ejection fraction, frequency of ventricular premature complexes or ventricular tachycardia.</s><s>Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, and digoxin are each effective in treating congestive heart failure, but many patients remain symptom-limited on all three medications. This trial was designed to determine whether the addition of oral flosequinan, a new direct-acting arterial and venous vasodilator with possible dose-dependent positive inotropic effects, improves exercise tolerance and quality of life in such patients. After 16 weeks, 100 mg flosequinan once daily produced a significant increment in median exercise time (64 seconds at 16 weeks) compared with placebo (5 seconds), whereas the higher-dose flosequinan group did not show a statistically significant increase. These results indicate that additional symptomatic benefit can be attained by adding flosequinan to a therapeutic regimen already including a converting enzyme inhibitor. Because in the future most patients will fall into this category, flosequinan is a potential adjunctive agent in the management of severe congestive heart failure.</s><s>Inotropic therapy, other than with digitalis glycosides, has had limited success in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. We investigated whether vesnarinone, a new positive inotropic agent, reduces morbidity and mortality and improves the quality of life of patients with symptomatic heart failure. Thereafter, patients were randomly assigned only to 60 mg of vesnarinone per day (a total of 239 patients) or placebo (a total of 238 patients). Significantly fewer patients in the group receiving 60 mg of vesnarinone than in the group receiving placebo (26 vs. 50 patients; P = 0.003) died or had worsening heart failure during the six-month study period. The reduction in risk was 50 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 20 to 69 percent). Similarly, there was a 62 percent reduction (95 percent confidence interval, 28 to 80 percent) in the risk of dying from any cause among the patients receiving vesnarinone. Six months of therapy with 60 mg of vesnarinone per day resulted in lower morbidity and mortality and improved the quality of life of patients with congestive heart failure.</s><s>A multicenter double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of oral enoximone, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, was conducted in 102 outpatients (50 receiving enoximone and 52 receiving placebo) with moderate to moderately severe congestive heart failure. There were no differences between groups in symptoms or exercise duration at the end of 4 months. (2.7 +/- 0.8 ml O2/kg/min) compared with placebo (-0.8 +/- 1.2 ml O2/kg/min). The dropout rate was significantly higher (p less than 0.02) with enoximone (46%) than with placebo (25%). Adverse effects other than death were slightly, but not significantly, higher with enoximone (32%) than with placebo (22%). Two deaths were sudden, two were from progressive congestive heart failure, and one was from acute myocardial infarction. With intention-to-treat analysis and inclusion of patients who were removed from therapy because of lack of study drug effect, 10 deaths occurred in the enoximone group, and three occurred in the placebo group (p less than 0.05).</s><s>This multicenter trial was conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of pimobendan, an inotropic agent with calcium-sensitizing properties and activity as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, in patients with heart failure. A dose range of pimobendan was used including 2.5 (n = 49), 5 (n = 51), or 10 mg/day (n = 49). One hundred fifty-eight (80%) patients were taking a converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) and 28 (14%) patients were taking a non-CEI vasodilator. Furthermore, quality of life measured with the Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire improved by 8.5 +/- 2.3 units in the 5-mg group compared with 1.3 +/- 2.2 units in the placebo group (p less than 0.01). Among all adverse events, headache tended to be more common in the pimobendan groups compared with placebo, with the incidence increasing with dose (p less than 0.05). Pimobendan appears to be useful adjunctive therapy when added to digitalis, diuretics, and vasodilators.</s><s>We randomly assigned 230 patients in sinus rhythm with moderately severe heart failure to treatment with digoxin, milrinone, both, or placebo. The left ventricular ejection fraction at rest was not significantly changed by milrinone (+0.2 percent; 95 percent confidence limits, -1.5 and 1.9), but it was increased by digoxin (+1.7 percent; P less than 0.01; 95 percent confidence limits, -0.03 and 3.4) and decreased by placebo (-2.0 percent; 95 percent confidence limits, -3.8 and -0.1). Analysis of mortality from all causes according to the intention to treat suggested an adverse effect of milrinone (P = 0.064). After adjustment for an excess of patients with lower ejection fractions randomly assigned to receive milrinone, this trend was not significant (P = 0.26). Increased ventricular arrhythmias occurred more frequently in patients who received milrinone than in those who did not (18 vs. 4 percent; P less than 0.03). We conclude that milrinone significantly increased exercise tolerance and reduced the frequency of worsened heart failure.</s>"

There were fewer patients with events (death or admission) after 12 months in the intervention group compared to the control group (29 vs 40, p=0.03) and fewer deaths after 12 months (7 vs 20, p=0.005). After 12 months the intervention was associated with a 55% decrease in admissions/patient/month (0.18 vs 0.40, p=0.06) and fewer days in hospital/patient/month (1.4 vs 3.9, p=0.02).</s><s>Heart failure (HF) is a major health problem resulting in a high financial burden for the healthcare system. Many previous HF management programmes reduced adverse clinical outcomes and costs, but they usually involved several professional figures as well as huge investments, requiring resources and budgets not often available in our healthcare system.

There were 81 all-cause hospital readmissions in the intervention group and 82 in the control group (P = NS). The present low-cost HF management programme reduced unplanned outpatient visits but proved ineffective in reducing subsequent readmissions and in improving clinical status. More intense follow-up monitoring and more resources are needed to achieve better results.</s><s>We determined the effect of a targeted education and support intervention on the rate of readmission or death and hospital costs in patients with heart failure (HF). After adjusting for clinical and demographic characteristics, the intervention group had a significantly lower risk of readmission compared with the control group (hazard ratio = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.32, 0.96; p = 0.03) and hospital readmission costs of $7,515 less per patient.

The study was located at the University Hospital in Maastricht, The Netherlands. The study included 179 patients (mean age 73 years, 58% men, New York Heart Association classification III and IV) admitted to a university hospital with symptoms of heart failure. The intervention patients received systematic education and support by a nurse in the hospital and at home. The 3 dimensions of quality of life improved after hospitalization in both groups, with no differences between intervention and control group as measured at each follow-up measurement.</s><s>Few studies have examined the potential benefits of specialist nurse-led programs of care involving home and clinic-based follow-up to optimise the post-discharge management of chronic heart failure (CHF).

CHF patients with evidence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction admitted to two hospitals in Northern England were assigned to a C+HBI lasting 6 months post-discharge (n=58) or to usual, post-discharge care (UC: n=48) via a cluster randomization protocol. During study follow-up, more UC patients had an unplanned readmission for any cause (44% vs. 22%: P=0.019, OR 1.95 95% CI 1.10-3.48) whilst 7 (15%) versus 5 (9%) UC and C+HBI patients, respectively, died (P=NS). C+HBI was associated with a non-significant, 45% reduction in the risk of death or readmission when adjusting for potential confounders (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.28-1.08: P=0.08).</s><s>Several trials support the usefulness of disease management (DM) for improving clinical outcomes in heart failure (HF). Most of these studies are limited by small sample size; absence of concurrent, randomized controls; limited follow-up; restriction to urban academic centers; and low baseline use of effective medications. During a 90-day follow-up, patients randomized to DM experienced fewer hospitalizations for HF [primary end point, 0.55+/-0.15 per patient-year alive versus 1.14+/-0.22 per patient-year alive in control subjects; relative risk (RR), 0.48, P=0.027]. Intervention patients showed a trend toward reduced all-cause hospitalizations and total hospital days.</s><s>To assess the efficacy of a multifactorial educational intervention carried out by a pharmacist in patients with heart failure (HF). The patients assigned to the intervention group received information about the disease, drug therapy, diet education, and active telephone follow-up. The intervention was performed by the pharmacy department in coordination with the cardiology unit. 134 patients were included, with a mean age of 75 years and a low educational level. At 12 months of follow-up, 32.9% fewer patients in the intervention group were admitted again vs. the control group.

All-cause mortality occurred in 29% of patients in the control group, and there was a trend toward lower mortality in the intervention groups combined (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.66-1.08; P = .18). There were slightly more hospitalizations in the 2 intervention groups (basic intervention group, P = .89; and intensive support group, P = .60).

Secondary outcomes were side effects, timing of expulsion and duration of bleeding. The crude complete abortion rate was 92.3% in the oral plus continued oral misoprostol group, in the vaginal-only group it was 93.5%, and it was 94.7% in the vaginal group that continued with oral misoprostol, when considering undetermined cases as failures.

Eligible women were randomised to receive mifepristone 200 mg orally followed by vaginal misoprostol 800 micrograms either 6 hours (n=225) or 36-48 hours (n=225) later. All participants were invited to attend for a follow-up pelvic ultrasound scan within 7 days following the misoprostol administration. They could elect to undergo an evacuation of uterus at any stage following the scan. In the 36- to 48-hour regimen, ten (5%) women had up to two further ultrasound scans to confirm a complete termination without the need for a surgical evacuation of uterus.

We concealed the allocation sequence from clinicians enrolling participants, and maintained double blinding throughout. The relative risk of failure to have a complete abortion with the lower dose of mifepristone was 1.6 (95% CI: 1.1-2.3) times that with the higher dose. There was no significant difference in side effects between the four treatment groups.</s><s>To compare the efficacy, adverse effects and acceptability of the three most common misoprostol regimens used with mifepristone for medical abortion. Three clinics associated with major research universities in Canada; two in major urban areas and one in a periurban area. Consenting women presenting for abortion services with gestations less than 56 days and who met inclusion criteria were given 200 mg mifepristone orally and then randomised into three misoprostol study groups: (group I) 400 micrograms of oral misoprostol, (group II) 600 micrograms of oral misoprostol, and (group III) 800 micrograms of vaginal misoprostol. Efficacy and adverse effects did not differ significantly across the three study groups.</s><s>OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine if a repeat dose of misoprostol following mifepristone or a single dose of misoprostol increases the efficacy of medical termination of pregnancy. Hospital, Pune, India, and the Health Centre, Larsen and Toubro Limited, Mumbai, India. Methods Women were randomised to receive one or two doses of 400 microgram oral misoprostol at the clinic 48 hours after administration of 200 mg mifepristone. Conclusion While an additional oral dose of 400 microgram misoprostol did not significantly increase the rate of complete abortion without surgical intervention, the additional dose did significantly reduce the rate of continuing pregnancies without compromising the acceptability and ease of use of the method.</s><s>A study was undertaken to determine whether the combination of oral tamoxifen and moistened misoprostol administered vaginally was superior to that of placebo and moistened misoprostol administered vaginally for elective termination of early pregnancies.A clinical trial was conducted with a study group of 150 healthy women with pregnancies of </=56 days gestational age who desired pregnancy termination. The main outcome measures were incidence of complete abortion, hemoglobin levels, duration of vaginal bleeding, and incidence of side effects. There were no differences in either group between earlier (</=49 days) and later (50-56 days) gestations. There were no significant differences in side effects between the two groups. These data suggest that pretreatment with tamoxifen is not necessary when using moistened vaginal misoprostol for abortion of pregnancies of </=56 days of gestation.</s><s>To compare the efficacy of 100 mg and 200 mg of mifepristone and 24- and 48-hour intervals to administration of 800 microg vaginal misoprostol for termination of early pregnancy. Two-sided 95% CI for the risk differences of failure to complete abortion were calculated and compared with 5% equivalence margin between two doses of mifepristone and two intervals to misoprostol administration. Rates of complete abortion without surgical intervention and adverse effects associated with the regimens. Interaction between doses and interval to misoprostol administration was not significant (P = 0.92). Both the 100 and 200 mg doses of mifepristone and the 24- and 48-hour intervals have a similar efficacy to achieve complete abortion in early pregnancy when mifepristone is followed by 800 micrograms of vaginally administered misoprostol.</s><s>The most effective route and best interval between several doses of misoprostol to induce abortion have not been defined. Our aim was to assess the effects of the interval between multiple doses of misoprostol and the route of administration to terminate pregnancy. This trial is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN10531821. Complete abortion rates at 2-week follow-up were recorded for 431 (84%) in the sublingual and for 434 (85%) women in the vaginal group when misoprostol was given at 3-h intervals (difference 0.4%, 95% CI -4.0 to 4.9, p=0.85 equivalence shown), and for 399 (78%) in the sublingual and for 425 (83%) in the vaginal 12-h groups (4.6%, -0.2 to 9.5, p=0.06, equivalence not shown). In the 3-h groups, pregnancy continued in 29 (6%) women after sublingual and in 20 (4%) women after vaginal administration (difference 1.8%, 95% CI -0.8 to 4.4, p=0.19, equivalence shown); in the 12-h groups it continued in 47 (9%) after sublingual and in 25 (5%) after vaginal administration (4.4%, 1.2-7.5, p=0.01, vaginal better than sublingual). Administration interval can be chosen between 3 h and 12 h when misoprostol is given vaginally. If administration is sublingual, the intervals between misoprostol doses need to be short, but side-effects are then increased.</s><s>A multi-centre, randomized trial was conducted to compare the efficacy and side-effects of two combination regimens of the antiprogestin RU 486 and the intramuscular PGE2 analogue sulprostone for termination of early pregnancy (amenorrhoea up to 49 days). Women in the 3-day group (n = 125) received 25 mg RU 486 twice daily for 3 days plus a single injection of 0.25 mg sulprostone in the morning of the third day of antiprogestin treatment. Overall, 88.8% had a complete abortion, 6.8% an incomplete abortion and 2.4% were treatment failures; in the remaining 2% treatment outcome could not be determined. Only three of the six women with treatment failure still had detectable fetal heart activity when the pregnancy was terminated by vacuum aspiration two weeks after the start of treatment.</s><s>Vaginal misoprostol has been shown to be an effective single agent for medical abortion. This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial compared a regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol with misoprostol alone for termination of early pregnancy. 250 women with gestations < or = 56 days were randomized by a random number table to receive either 200 mg mifepristone orally or placebo followed 48 h later by 800 microg vaginal misoprostol. Abortion success was defined as complete abortion without the use of surgical aspiration. The 88% efficacy obtained with vaginal misoprostol alone may be clinically acceptable when mifepristone is not available.</s><s>Abortion was attempted in 39 women in early pregnancy (less than 56 days amenorrhea) with the progesterone antagonist RU486 alone (150 mg per day for 4 days) or in combination with a PG analogue, 16,16-dimethyl-trans-delta 2-PGE1 (Gemeprost) in the form of a 1 mg vaginal pessary. Vaginal bleeding followed by complete abortion occurred in 18 of 19 women who received RU486 + 1 mg PG pessary as compared to only 12 of 20 women who received RU486 alone (P less than 0.01). The onset of crampy abdominal pain (median: 3 vs 4 days) and vaginal bleeding (3 vs 3 days) was similar in the RU486 and RU486 + PG groups, respectively. It is concluded that the combination of RU486 and a single PG vaginal pessary is a highly effective means of inducing therapeutic abortion in early pregnancy and offers an alternative to surgery.</s><s>Our purpose was to determine whether vaginal misoprostol 7 days rather than 3 days after methotrexate injection increases the percent of successful abortions on the day of misoprostol administration. A randomized controlled trial was performed in women requesting an abortion at < or = 56 days' gestation. Complete abortion occurred in 38 of 46 (83%) patients in group 1 and 39 of 40 (98%) in group 2 (p = 0.033). Of the women with complete abortions, 30 of 46 (65%) in group 1 and 27 of 40 (68%) in group 2 aborted the same day as the first or second dose of misoprostol (p = 0.823). Vaginal bleeding lasted 14 +/- 5 (mean +/- SD) days in group 1 and 17 +/- 9 days in group 2. Treatment failures in group 1 were four continuing pregnancies (9%), two incomplete abortions (4%), and two women who requested surgical termination after receiving both medications (4%).</s><s>A 400 mcg dose of sublingual misoprostol has high efficacy and few side effects when used with 200 mg mifepristone for medical abortion through 63 days' gestation. Side effects were similar in both groups, with only fever or chills reported by significantly more women in the sublingual arm. The sublingual route appears superior to the regimen of 400 mcg misoprostol used orally and may be a good option for mifepristone medical abortion.</s><s>Medical termination of pregnancy can be successfully performed with a combination of mifepristone (RU 486) and a prostaglandin analogue. The study population consisted of 270 women seeking abortion within 63 days after the onset of amenorrhea. The dose of mifepristone was 600 mg, and the dose of misoprostol was 800 micrograms. Expulsion of the conceptus without the need for a surgical procedure occurred in 95 percent of the women who received misoprostol vaginally and in 87 percent of those who received it orally (P = 0.03). Vomiting and diarrhea were reported more frequently by the women who received oral misoprostol than by those who received vaginal misoprostol (P = 0.04 and P = 0.002, respectively). After the administration of mifepristone, vaginal administration of misoprostol is more effective and better tolerated than oral administration for the induction of first-trimester abortion.</s><s>To compare the efficacy of two different regimens of mifepristone followed by misoprostol for medical abortion in women with menstrual delay of < or = 35 days. We enrolled 1,589 healthy pregnant women with menstrual delay of < or = 35 days who were requesting nonsurgical abortion. We concealed the allocation assignments from investigators and participants and maintained double-blinding throughout the study. The complete abortion rate with the lower dose of mifepristone was similar to that with the higher dose (89.3% vs 88.1%) The crude relative risk of failure to achieve complete abortion with the 200 mg dose compared with the 600 mg dose was 0.9 (95% CI 0.7 to 1.2). No significant differences emerged in the frequency of side effects between the two mifepristone groups. Women with a menstrual delay of four to five weeks had twice the risk of failure to abort compared with those who received treatment within two weeks of the expected menses. The regimens of 600 mg or 200 mg of mifepristone, followed by a single oral dose of misoprostol 400 microg 48 hours later, were not sufficiently efficient in inducing abortion when the menstrual delay was > 21 days.</s><s>To investigate the efficacy of 800 micrograms misoprostol (a PGE1 analogue) when administered to women pretreated with mifepristone for early pregnancy termination. The impact of these regimens on blood pressure was investigated in a subgroup of patients. Complete abortion rates, the frequency and severity (patients' perception) of gastrointestinal side effects, and blood pressure changes in response to prostaglandin administration. There were two ongoing pregnancies in the first group (2.5%) and three (4%) in the second. The combination of mifepristone and oral misoprostol provides an alternative method to inducing abortion of pregnancies of up to eight weeks gestation. Patients receiving the single dose of 800 micrograms were more troubled by diarrhoea than those on the sequential regimen.</s><s>The effect of a 1 week course of daily oral misoprostol after medical abortion with mifepristone and misoprostol on the amount of post-abortal blood loss was studied. A total of 150 women (gestation <or=63 days) were randomized to three groups using computer-generated tables. The incidence of diarrhoea was significantly higher (66, 55.1 and 12.5% respectively) in the groups with oral misoprostol after abortion. A 1 week course of oral misoprostol (0.4 mg twice daily) could not decrease the duration and amount of vaginal bleeding.</s><s>Our goal was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of methotrexate in doses of 50 mg/m2 and 60 mg/m2 in regimens for early abortion. A randomized controlled trial was performed in women requesting an abortion at < or = 49 days' gestation. Twenty women were treated with intramuscular methotrexate 50 mg/m2 (group 1) or 60 mg/m2 (group 2). Methotrexate levels were determined serially for the first 24 hours, then every 24 hours for 7 days. Both the maximum concentration of methotrexate and the area under the curve were significantly greater for group 2. Methotrexate 50 mg/m2 intramuscularly has the same clearance rates when administered during pregnancy as in a nonpregnant state, and maximum concentrations do not reach sustained toxic levels.</s><s>A combination of mifepristone and misoprostol provides an effective method of medical abortion for early pregnancy. Complete abortion occurred in 98.2% (95% CI: 93-99) of women in the sublingual group and 93.8% (95% CI: 88-97) in the vaginal group. Fever, chills and gastrointestinal side-effects (nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea) were significantly more common in the sublingual group. Further randomized trials are required to find out the optimal dose of sublingual misoprostol that can give the highest complete abortion rate and lowest incidence of side-effects.</s><s>To find out the optimal doses regimen of mifepristone with misoprostol for termination early pregnancy. A randomized comparative study in 1,621 women requesting medical abortion at < or = 49 days from 9 hospitals was conducted in Hebei, women were randomly divided into 2 groups by 2:1 ratio. In control group (n = 494), mifepristone 50 mg immediately, then, 25 mg b. i. d (total amount of 150 mg), plus misoprostol 600 micrograms at 8:00 in the morning on 3th day.</s><s>To examine the clinical efficacy of mifepristone 100 mg followed 2 days later by misoprostol 400 microg orally or 800 microg vaginally in women at up to 49 days' gestation. Women returned for follow-up evaluations 24 +/- 1 hour after using the misoprostol and then 2-3 weeks later. Twenty-four hours after receiving misoprostol, 34 (85%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 71%, 94%) of the 40 women in group 1 and 38 (95%; 95% CI 85%, 99%) of the 40 women in group 2 had complete abortions. Overall, complete abortion without surgical intervention occurred in 34 women in group 1 (85%; 95% CI 71%, 94%) and 40 women in group 2 (100%; 95% CI 91%, 100%; P =.03).</s><s>Mifepristone and oral misoprostol are typically used for medical abortion in women up to 49 days of gestation, with a 36- to 48-hour interval between the medications. The 1,128 participants swallowed mifepristone 200 mg and were then randomized to self-administer misoprostol intravaginally immediately in the office (group 1) or 24 hours later at home (group 2). Subjects returned for an evaluation, including transvaginal ultrasonography, 7+/-1 days after initiating treatment. Women who had not aborted were offered a second dose of misoprostol and returned for another evaluation in approximately 1 week. Treatment was considered a failure if a suction aspiration was performed for any indication. The abortion rates between groups did not significantly differ by gestational age.</s><s>To compare the safety and efficacy of early abortion by administration of methotrexate and misoprostol vs administration of misoprostol alone. Sixty-three women volunteered for the trial; 61 completed the study and are included in the analysis. An abortion was considered successful if the pregnancy ended without requiring a surgical procedure. Complete abortion occurred in 28 (90%) of 31 patients in group 1 and 14 (47%) of 30 patients in group 2 (P < .001). Seventeen (61%) of the 28 women in group 1 who aborted did so the same day as misoprostol administration; vaginal bleeding lasted a mean (+/- SD) of 10 (+/- 4) days, and beta-hCG level was less than or equal to 10 IU/L by a mean of 31 (+/- 6) days after methotrexate administration. There were three treatment failures in group 1: two ongoing pregnancies (6%) and one incomplete abortion (3%). Misoprostol side effects were diarrhea in 18% and nausea and vomiting in 5%. Both drugs are available throughout the United States, and both drugs are inexpensive. This combination may offer an alternative to the use of antiprogestin and prostaglandin for medical abortion.</s><s>To demonstrate equivalence between mifepristone 200 mg followed 6 to 8 hours later and 24 hours later by misoprostol 800 microg vaginally for abortion in women up to 63 days of gestation. Participants returned for an evaluation, including transvaginal ultrasonography, 7 +/- 1 days after initiating treatment. Treatment was considered a failure if a suction aspiration was performed for any indication. Nausea, vomiting, and heavy bleeding were also significantly greater for women in group 2 after misoprostol treatment. Mifepristone 200 mg followed 6 to 8 hours later by misoprostol 800 microg vaginally is as effective for abortion and has significantly fewer side effects as compared with regimens using a 24-hour dosing interval.</s><s>To compare the side effect profiles of regimens of oral and vaginal administration of misoprostol after a single oral dose of 200 mg of mifepristone and to investigate patients' perceptions of medical abortion. Mifepristone 200 mg orally on day one, followed by 0.8 mg misoprostol either orally or vaginally on day three. The oral group (O/O group) and one of the vaginal groups (V/O group) continued with 0.4 mg of oral misoprostol, and the vaginal-only group (V-only group) with oral placebo, twice daily for seven days. Patients' perceptions were asked at the second follow up visit, six weeks after treatment. Misoprostol induced fever during at least 3 hours after administration in up to 6% of the women, this peak being slightly higher and taking place later with the vaginal route. In the two groups that continued misoprostol, 27% of women had diarrhoea between the misoprostol visit and the two-week follow up visit, compared with 9% in the placebo group. The pregnancy-related symptoms decrease significantly with time during medical abortion. Nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea were more frequent after oral administration of misoprostol. Should a need arise, a majority of women would choose medical abortion again and would prefer to have it at a health facility rather than at home.</s><s>To compare the efficacy and side-effects of mifepristone 75 mg in capsule form versus 150 mg in tablet form followed by misoprostol for medical termination of early pregnancy. In a prospective randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, a total of 480 women who were 49 days or less pregnant were randomized by means of a random number table to receive either two tablets in the morning and one tablet 12 h later for 2 days (group A) or three capsules orally twice daily for 2 days, the first dose being double all subsequent doses (group B). There were no significant differences between the two study groups in the rates of complete abortion (95.4% in group A versus 96.3% in group B), incomplete abortion (3.8% in group A, 3.3% in group B) and continued pregnancy (0.8% in group A, 0.4% in group B). The incidence of side-effects, such as vomiting, nausea, headache, diarrhea and lower abdominal pain was similar in the two groups.</s><s>Three different regimens of RU 486, a progesterone receptor blocking agent, were compared for their ability to terminate early human pregnancy. No significant difference in efficacy was seen between the three dose regimens. Response to treatment, measured as reported onset of bleeding and passage of products of conception, however, occurred significantly later on the 10 mg x 2 regimen than on the other two dose regimens. In each treatment group, women who subsequently aborted completely had significantly lower pretreatment levels of hCG than women with incomplete abortion or continuing pregnancy.</s><s>The purpose of this study was to compare the outcome and side effects of using the drugs methotrexate and misoprostol, alone or in combination, to induce abortion. methotrexate on day 1 and, if the hCG level had risen by > 50% of the initial level on day 4, a second dose was given. Group 3 received 50 mg/m2 methotrexate intramuscularly followed 3 days later by 800 micrograms vaginal misoprostol and were re-examined on day 7. Complete abortion occurred in 25 (69%) of the 36 subjects in group 1, 21 (58%) of the 36 subjects in group 2, and 32 (89%) of the 36 subjects in group 3. There were significant differences between the mean gestational age of the successful abortions and the failures in group 1 (no abortion occurred at more than 49 days gestation), but not in groups 2 or 3.</s><s>Intramuscular methotrexate followed by vaginal misoprostol has been shown to be effective for abortion at < or = 49 days gestation. The misoprostol dose was repeated the next day if the abortion did not occur. However, women in the 50 mg group passed the pregnancy within 24 hours of the first or second dose of methotrexate more often than women in the 25 mg group (80% vs. 50%, p = 0.35).</s><s>To study the efficacy, safety, and acceptability of oral immediately swallowed and buccal misoprostol 800 mcg after mifepristone 200 mg for terminating pregnancy through 63 days since the last menstrual period (LMP). This seven-site study randomly assigned 966 women seeking abortions to oral or buccal misoprostol 800 mcg 24-36 hours after mifepristone 200 mg with 7-14-day follow-up. Through 49 days since the LMP, oral and buccal regimens performed similarly, but success with oral misoprostol decreased as pregnancy advanced. Furthermore, in this gestational age group, there were significantly more ongoing pregnancies among women who took misoprostol orally (7.9% [9 of 114]) compared with buccally (1.7% [2 of 115]; P=.029, RR 4.54, 95% CI 1.0-20.55). Buccal misoprostol 800 mcg after mifepristone 200 mg is a good option for medical abortion through 63 days since the LMP.</s><s>Four multicentre clinical trials on interruption of early pregnancy (less than or equal to 49 days of amenorrhea) using RU 486 have been conducted in China, including 2321 subjects. However, RU 486 combined with PG was equally effective at all time points studied (less than or equal to 35 days of amenorrhea: 98.1%, 36-42 days: 92%, 42-49 days: 87.4%). When compared with RU 486 alone Ru 486 + PG also produced a shorter bleeding time and a lower volume of blood loss (n = 21, 52 ml vs n = 13, 117 ml). The time elapsed between RU 486 intake and expulsion of the conceptus was significantly shorter in the RU 486+PG group (n = 97, 31 days) than that in the RU 486 alone group (n = 95, 4.4 4.4 days). Main side effects, nausea/vomiting and headache/dizziness, were mainly due to RU 486.</s><s>Mifepristone (600 mg) in combination with a prostaglandin has been demonstrated to be a safe, acceptable alternative to vacuum aspiration for induction of abortion in the first 9 weeks of pregnancy. In this study, 800 women seeking an abortion at gestational age < or = 63 days amenorrhoea were randomized to receive either 0.5 mg gemeprost by vaginal pessary (group I) or 600 micrograms misoprostol (group II) by mouth approximately 48 h after taking 200 mg mifepristone by mouth. The side-effects and number of complete abortions were used as measures of efficacy. It was not possible to assess the outcome with certainty in the remaining 23 women. The incidence of nausea and vomiting after misoprostol (47.8 and 21.9% respectively) was higher (P < 0.001) than after gemeprost (33.9 and 12% respectively).</s><s>It has been shown that the antiprogestin RU 486 (mifepristone) increases the sensitivity of the early pregnant human uterus to the stimulatory action of synthetic prostaglandin E (PGE) analogues. To examine if RU 486 also increases uterine sensitivity to the naturally occurring PGE2 given orally, two investigative approaches were used in the present studies: (i) direct registration of uterine contractions before and after PGE2 administration in untreated and RU 486-treated early pregnant women; and (ii) a double-blind, randomized, controlled efficacy trial involving treatment of pregnant women (amenorrhoea of less than or equal to 49 days) with RU 486 (25 mg twice daily for 4 days) and PGE2 (1 mg once or twice) or placebo on the last day of RU 486 treatment. Overall, 25 of 42 women (59%) had a complete abortion, 15 women (36%) did not abort and the remaining two had incomplete abortions. Women with complete abortions had significantly lower pretreatment levels of progesterone and a longer duration of induced bleeding than those who did not abort.</s><s>To compare two regimens of mifepristone plus gemeprost for early pregnancy termination. Three hundred eighty-five healthy women up to 35 years of age with amenorrhea less than or equal to 49 days requesting pregnancy termination. Treatment outcome was identical in both groups with an overall complete abortion rate of 92.7% among the 385 women included in the analysis. The frequency of complaints, bleeding patterns, and changes in hemoglobin, beta-human chorionic gonadotropin, estradiol, and progesterone were also similar in both groups.</s><s>Mifepristone-misoprostol medical abortion has been approved in the United States since 2000. U.S. providers have preferred to use vaginal misoprostol because of evidence that such a regimen is more effective in later gestations. Four hundred forty-two women were enrolled in the study, and complete data were available on 429. The efficacy rate was 95% (205/216) in the buccal group and 93% (199/213) in the vaginal group (chi(2)=0.43, p=.51). Nausea was the most commonly reported side effect, affecting 70% in the buccal group and 62% in the vaginal group.</s><s>Misoprostol alone vs. methotrexate followed by misoprostol for early abortion.</s><s>One-hundred-and-twenty women of less than 56 days amenorrhoea were treated with a single dose of 600 mg of mifepristone in combination with half or a whole 1 mg gemeprost vaginal pessary. This study confirmed the effectiveness of mifepristone and prostaglandin for the induction of early abortion but suggests that more research should be carried out to determine the lowest effective doses of both drugs.</s><s>A prospective trial including 300 pregnant women seeking elective abortion was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of methotrexate and misoprostol for abortion at < or = 63 days' gestation. Complete abortion occurred in 273 of 300 patients (91%, 95%, CI 87, 94%) patients. No significant statistical differences were found in the success rates when misoprostol was given days 3, 4, or 5 after the administration of methotrexate (p = 0.69). Vaginal bleeding lasted 7.1 +/- 3.8 days, spotting 4.1 +/- 2.5 days, and total bleeding 11.2 +/- 4.1 days.</s><s>A multicentre randomized open clinical trial was conducted to compare the efficacy and side effects of two regimens of mifepristone with misoprostol, and mifepristone with PG05 for termination of early pregnancy (amenorrhoea < = 49 days). Six-hundred women in early pregnancy, who requested medical abortion were randomly allocated into 3 groups. In group 2 (n = 150), the same regimen of mifepristone was given, but dl-15-methyl PGF2 alpha (PG05) 1 mg vaginal suppository was inserted on the third day. The complete abortion rate were 94.4%, 97.3%, and 94.6% for group 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Lower abdominal pain was the main complaint which was reported by 82% of the subjects after PGs administration. Besides, it has advantages of convenience of use, less side effects, easy storage and transfer, and low cost.</s><s>The primary objective of this study was to determine if buccal misoprostol was as effective as vaginal misoprostol in medical abortions. This was a randomized controlled trial of 600 microg misoprostol by the buccal or vaginal routes used 3 to 6 days after 50 mg/m2 methotrexate. The outcome measures were the number of women who had aborted by Day 8, side effects and acceptability. Overall acceptability and route acceptability were similar in the two groups.</s><s>This study was undertaken to compare oral to injected methotrexate with respect to effectiveness, side effects, and acceptability. In phase 2 another 87 women were allowed to choose between the oral and injected routes. This study indicates that for medical abortions induced with methotrexate and misoprostol it is possible to offer both the oral and injected routes of methotrexate without sacrificing efficacy and that about half of the women offered a choice will choose the oral route.</s><s>The objective of this study was to determine whether the oral route of misoprostol was as effective as the vaginal route of misoprostol 1 day after mifepristone. Women self-administered misoprostol 1 day after taking one-third of the standard dose of mifepristone (200 mg) orally. A dose of vaginal misoprostol was administered to women with a continuing pregnancy who then returned 1 day later to Day 15. The primary outcome measures were a complete medical abortion by the first or by the second follow-up visits. By the second follow-up visit, the complete abortion rate was 95% for oral misoprostol and 99% for vaginal misoprostol (chi(2) = 21.76, p = 0.001). The trial demonstrated that although two doses of oral misoprostol were effective, the vaginal misoprostol was more effective at inducing an early medical abortion at 1 day after low-dose mifepristone, and the regimen could be extended to 63 days gestation.</s>"

All 470 eligible students (63% female) aged 11-14 years volunteered to participate. The program significantly improved the body satisfaction of the intervention students and significantly changed aspects of their self-esteem; social acceptance, physical appearance, and athletic ability became less important for the intervention students and more important for control students. Female intervention students rated their physical appearance as perceived by others significantly higher than control students and allowed their body weight to increase appropriately by preventing the age increase in weight-losing behaviors of the control students. One year after the intervention, body image and attitude changes were still present. The intervention program was effective, safe, having no effect on measures of students' anxiety or depression, and was rated highly by students. This new approach to prevent the development of eating disorders by improving self-esteem may be effective, particularly if reinforced by teachers and family.</s>"

Results of a repeated measures MONOVA revealed significant differences in the pattern of change over time between subjects in the experimental and control groups on a measure of actual maternal behaviors.</s><s>To use social learning theory to develop and examine the effectiveness of a 15-minute, culturally sensitive videotape in altering mealtime communication and attitudes among African-American adolescent mothers. High schools, WIC (Women, Infants, and Children) Clinics, and Family Support Centers serving low-income families. The messages, title, music, and setting were designed by an advisory group of six African-American adolescent mothers who were filmed feeding their infants in their homes. At follow-up, intervention mothers were more involved with their infant and reported more favorable attitudes toward feeding and communication than control mothers. Brief culturally sensitive videotapes may be effective strategies to promote parenting skills and to prevent social and health problems among adolescents.</s>"

        "Abstracts": "<s>This study assessed the effects of short-term circuit weight training (CWT) on glycaemic control in NIDDM. Pooled time-series analysis, using a random effects model, revealed an overall decrease in self-monitored glucose levels with CWT compared to controls. Significant reductions from baseline values were observed in both the glucose (-213 mmol l-1 per 120 min, P < 0.05) and insulin (-6130 pmol l-1 per 120 min, P < 0.05) area under the curve following CWT relative to controls. Short-term CWT therefore may provide a practical exercise alternative in the lifestyle management of this condition.</s><s>To examine the effect of high-intensity progressive resistance training combined with moderate weight loss on glycemic control and body composition in older patients with type 2 diabetes. Sedentary, overweight men and women with type 2 diabetes, aged 60-80 years (n = 36), were randomized to high-intensity progressive resistance training plus moderate weight loss (RT & WL group) or moderate weight loss plus a control program (WL group). HbA(1c) fell significantly more in RT & WL than WL at 3 months (0.6 +/- 0.7 vs. 0.07 +/- 0.8%, P < 0.05) and 6 months (1.2 +/- 1.0 vs. 0.4 +/- 0.8%, P < 0.05). There were no between-group differences for fasting glucose, insulin, serum lipids and lipoproteins, or resting blood pressure.</s><s>Type 2 diabetes is a strong risk factor for coronary heart disease and sudden cardiac death. Measurements taken at baseline and follow-up included VO(2max), standard time and frequency domain measures of HRV during 24-h recording, and BRS by the phenylephrine method. Significant improvements in VO(2max) (exercise group: +2.3 ml x kg(-1) x min(-1); P < 0.005 vs. control group), muscle strength, and glycemic control (exercise group: HbA(1c) -0.9%; P < 0.001 vs. control group) were observed in the exercise group. No significant changes in the time or frequency domain measures of HRV or in systemic hemodynamics were observed. We concluded that exercise training improves BRS sensitivity in type 2 diabetes subjects in addition to increasing the exercise capacity and muscle strength and improving glucose control.</s><s>We investigated the effect of an 8 week circuit training (CT) program, combining aerobic and resistance exercise, on indices of glycemic control, cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength and body composition in 16 subjects (age 52 +/- 2 years) with type 2 diabetes using a prospective randomised crossover protocol. Submaximal exercise heart rate and rate pressure product were significantly lower after training (P<0.05), whilst ventilatory threshold increased (11.8 +/- 0.7 vs 13.8 +/- 0.6 ml kg(-1)min(-1), P<0.001). Muscular strength also increased with training (403 +/- 30 to 456 +/- 31 kg, P<0.001), whilst skinfolds (148.7 +/- 11.5 vs 141.1 +/- 10.7 mm, P<0.05), % body fat (29.5 +/- 1.0 vs 28.7 +/- 1.1%, P<0.05) and waist:hip ratio (99.2 +/- 1.5 vs 97.9 +/- 1.4%, P<0.05) significantly decreased.</s><s>The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether a combined resistance and aerobic training program would improve insulin sensitivity compared with aerobic training alone in postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes. Both exercise groups had reduced abdominal subcutaneous and visceral AT and increased muscle density. The Ae+RT training group exhibited a significantly greater increase in muscle density than the Ae only group. Muscle density retained a relationship with glucose disposal after controlling for abdominal AT. Adding resistance training to aerobic training enhanced glucose disposal in postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes.</s><s>Patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes are at greatly increased risk for coronary artery disease. Therefore, we examined the effect of a low-to-moderate-intensity (mean 69 per cent of maximal heart rate) walking program on lipids, glucose, insulin, glycosylated hemoglobin and cardiovascular fitness. Nine women and seven men, mean age 56, were randomly assigned to a control or an exercise group which exercised three times per week for two months. Resting systolic blood pressure decreased from 141 to 130 mm Hg after training, and resting heart rate decreased from 88 to 81. Glycosylated hemoglobin decreased in the exercise group in seven or eight subjects and in only two of eight controls.</s><s>To evaluate the effects of an intense physical training program on abdominal fat distribution, glycemic control, and insulin sensitivity in patients with NIDDM and to determine whether branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) supplements influence these effects. Physical training consisted of a supervised 45-min cycling exercise at 75% of their oxygen uptake peak (VO2 peak) two times per week and an intermittent exercise one time per week for 2 months. Patients who exercised increased their VO2 peak by 41% and their insulin sensitivity by 46%. Physical training significantly decreased abdominal fat evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (umbilicus), with a greater loss of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) (48%) in comparison with the loss of subcutaneous adipose tissue (18%), but did not significantly affect body weight.</s><s>The effects of 4 months' physical exercise on the metabolic control in non-insulin-dependent diabetes were studied in 25 patients divided randomly into exercise (n = 13) and control (n = 12) groups. The mean fall in fasting plasma glucose from 11.8-10.5 mmol/l was not statistically significant. The responses of plasma insulin and C-peptide to oral glucose increased significantly during the exercise period. However, patients with initially poorest metabolic control were not able to improve their physical fitness and did not show significant improvement in metabolic control. In the control group no changes occurred in any parameter of glucose metabolism.</s><s>Exercise should be an integral part of the treatment in non-insulin-dependent (NIDDM) diabetic patients, yet most of these patients' performance is low, mainly because of their obesity and concomitant macrovascular disease. Forty patients aged 56.6 +/- 6.6 years were assigned randomly according to age and sex into exercise and control groups. The exercise group trained for 45 min 3 times weekly for 12 weeks, while the control group did not change their lifestyle.</s><s>The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether moderate intensity resistance training (RT) improves glycaemic control in obese, type 2 diabetic men. Glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA 1c ), fasting glucose and insulin, glucose and insulin 120 minutes (2h) after a 75 g oral glucose load, body composition and muscular strength and endurance were measured before and after the 10-week experimental period. In the RT group fasting glucose and insulin decreased with training (p < 0.05) and decreases in HbA 1c approached significance (p = 0.057). Muscular strength and endurance increased by 25 to 52 % in the RT group but was unchanged in controls.</s><s>In healthy young subjects, training increases insulin sensitivity but decreases the capacity to secrete insulin. We studied whether training changes beta-cell function in type 2 diabetic patients. Patients, stratified into \"moderate\" and \"low\" secretors according to individual C-peptide responses to an intravenous glucagon test, were randomly assigned to a training program [ergometer cycling 30-40 min/day, including at least 20 min at 75% maximum oxygen consumption (Vo(2 max)), 5 days/wk for 3 mo] or a sedentary schedule. Likewise, no change in beta-cell response was seen after training in the low secretors (n = 5). In contrast, moderate secretors (n = 9) showed significant increases in beta-cell responses to 18 and 25 mM hyperglycemia and to arginine stimulation.</s><s>The effect of Qi-gong relaxation exercise on the control of type 2 diabetes mellitus: a randomized controlled trial.</s>"

        "Abstracts": "<s>Asthma patients pose special problems as far as the medical supervision, danger of symptoms and the course of the disease are concerned. Some 90 asthma patients were registered for the treatment in the Heidelberg Medical Clinic. The average age of the patients was 43.5 years and the average duration of illness 16.8 years. These results support the conclusion that psychosomatic group therapy can make an important contribution to the treatment of asthma patients. Body therapy practised in 'autogenic training' and 'functional relaxation' seems to be another important healing factor for the treatment in addition to the discussion sessions and the exchange of information.</s><s>Relaxation therapy in bronchial asthma.</s><s>There is evidence that educational programmes may improve patient's compliance with asthma treatment and control symptoms. Whilst medical parameters have been thoroughly studied, few data are available concerning psychological intervention. The aim of our open pilot study was to verify whether any difference in perceived illness and response style to asthma existed in the patients enrolled in an Asthma Rehabilitation Group (ARG) and in a Control Group (CG). Forty consecutive asthmatics were randomly enrolled, all of whom were diagnosed, treated and followed-up according to the International Guidelines. Both groups underwent a psychological assessment at baseline and after one year.</s><s>Several behavioral medicine interventions (e.g., relaxation training and written emotional expression) have been proposed as effective supplemental treatments for individuals with chronic illnesses such as asthma. Whether these treatments are feasible or effective in a manual-based, self-administered format is unclear, and few studies have examined the effectiveness of such treatments presented in a complementary format. We examined the feasibility and effectiveness of a 4-week stress management treatment compared with a matched placebo intervention in young adults with asthma. Both groups considered the workbooks credible treatment interventions and completed them conscientiously.</s><s>A prospective, randomised, single blind, and controlled trial of a hypnotic technique was undertaken in 39 adults with mild to moderate asthma graded for low and high susceptibility to hypnosis. Daily home recordings of symptoms improved by 41% (p less than 0.01), peak expiratory flow rates improved by 5.5% (p less than 0.01), and use of bronchodilators decreased by 26.2% (p less than 0.05). A control group 17 patients and 10 patients undergoing treatment with low susceptibility to hypnosis had no change in either bronchial hyper-responsiveness or any of the symptoms recorded at home. This study shows the efficacy of a hypnotic technique in adult asthmatics who are moderately to highly susceptible to hypnosis.</s><s>An individualised asthma programme directed at behavioural change was evaluated in asthmatic subjects who reported complaints and impairment, despite adequate medical treatment. Both groups were evaluated at three consecutive moments, each separated by 3 months; the programme was delivered between the first two evaluations. At onset the patient received a workbook containing information, exercises and homework assignments. Psycho-education, behavioural and cognitive techniques were introduced during six 1-h individual sessions. Compared with controls the programme group reported less symptoms (obstruction, fatigue), better quality of life (activity, symptoms, emotions), decreased negative affectivity, and increased adherence, immediately after finishing the programme and at 3 months follow-up.</s><s>This study tested the efficacy of a nurse-administered 8-week group treatment program for adults with asthma suffering from coexisting panic disorder. Forty-eight women with a confirmed diagnosis of asthma and panic disorder were randomly allocated to a treatment condition (n=25) and a wait-list control condition (n=23). Twenty-five participants--15 in the treatment group and 10 in the wait-list control group--completed treatment. The results demonstrate that the CBT-AE program is capable of producing substantial and durable antipanic and antianxiety treatment effects and led to substantial but nonsustained improvement in morning peak-flow expiratory rate and asthma-related quality of life.</s><s>Despite the growing number of studies of imagery and the use of complementary and alternative modalities as treatments for asthma, research on mental imagery in adults with asthma is practically, nonexistent. The purpose of this feasibility study was to lay groundwork for a larger follow-up clinical trial. (Power is the ability to make aware choices with the intention of freely involving oneself in creating desired change.) Sixty-eight adults with symptomatic asthma, after 4 weeks of baseline data collection and analysis, met requirements for this randomized controlled study. 1) Spirometry (FEV1); 2) medication use; 3) Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire; 4) Beck Depression Inventory; 5) Spielberger Anxiety Scales (A-State and A-Trait); 6) Barrett Power as Knowing Participation in Change Tool, Version II; 7) Epstein Balloon Test of Ability to Image. There was little evidence of statistical change in this feasibility study; yet, valuable lessons were learned. Eight of 17 (47%) participants in the MI group reduced or discontinued their medications. Persons who reduced or discontinued their medications showed neither an increase in pulmonary function prior to medication discontinuation, nor a fall in these parameters following discontinuation. However, the study did provide significant data to plan a larger scale study of the use of mental imagery with adult asthmatics. Lessons learned in this study may facilitate improvement in research designs.</s><s>We evaluated the effectiveness of heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback as a complementary treatment for asthma. Subjects were first prestabilized using controller medication and then were randomly assigned to experimental groups. Subjects recorded daily asthma symptoms and twice-daily peak expiratory flows. Spirometry was performed before and after each weekly treatment session under the HRV and placebo biofeedback conditions, and at triweekly assessment sessions under the waiting list condition. Compared with the two control groups, subjects in both of the two HRV biofeedback groups were prescribed less medication, with minimal differences between the two active treatments. Measures from forced oscillation pneumography similarly showed improvement in pulmonary function.</s><s>To compare biologically targeted imagery (BTI) and critical thinking asthma management (CTAM) outcomes. Interventions were asthma education plus treatment (BTI or CTAM for two 2-hour sessions per week for 6 weeks). For CTAM, data collection occurred at wait-list control (WLC) (12 weeks extended baseline), preintervention (3 weeks), during the intervention (6 weeks), and postintervention (6 weeks). WLC improved all POMS-BI scores except anxiety, increased internal LoC, and reduced problematic behaviors. Compared to WLC, BTI reduced wheezing, anxiety, and chance LoC, and increased asthma knowledge, attitude, and self-efficacy. Both interventions significantly improved symptoms and asthma management more than record keeping.</s><s>One hundred six asthmatic subjects were medically prestabilized, then assigned to eight sessions of progressive relaxation, music, or a waiting-list. Relaxation-group subjects reported feeling the most deeply relaxed and produced the greatest improvement in forced expiratory flow during the last presession assessment period. All groups showed decreases in pulmonary function immediately after relaxation sessions. None of the changes in pulmonary function reached levels that are accepted in drug trials to be of clinical significance, and the therapeutic changes occurred only in the situation where training was rendered.</s><s>This pilot study compared biofeedback to increase respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) with EMG and incentive inspirometry biofeedback in asthmatic adults. A three-group design (Waiting List Control n = 5, RSA biofeedback n = 6, and EMG biofeedback n = 6) was used. Additional five-min epochs of data were collected at the beginning and end of the biofeedback period (or, in the control group, self-relaxation). Decreases in respiratory impedance occurred only in the RSA biofeedback group. Subjects did not report significantly more relaxation during EMG or RSA biofeedback than during the control condition. However, deep breathing during RSA biofeedback is a possible alternate explanation.</s><s>Stress, unpleasant emotions and autonomic imbalance may play a main role in precipitating asthmatic attacks. In this study two homogeneous groups of asthmatic patients (N = 24) are treated over an eight-month period. The experimental group was treated with autogenic therapy and the control group with supportive group psychotherapy.</s>"

Safety parameters including blood chemistry and hematology, adrenal function assessment; bone densitometry, and muscle strength testing, were not altered significantly. Two patients who received TAO had elevated liver enzyme levels; one required discontinuation of TAO and one experienced spontaneous resolution without intervention.

Blood gas pressures showed a trend to improvement with a mean rise in oxygen tension of 2mm Hg(0-2kPa) in the aminophylline group and of 6mm Hg (0-8kPa) in the salbutamol group. Electrocardiogram patterns also showed overall improvement, and mean decreases in pulse rate of 8 beats per minute and 2 beats per minute were noted in the aminophylline and salbutamol groups respectively. Differences in results did not reach conventional levels of significance and no serious side effects were noted.</s><s>The mainstay of treatment for acute asthma in children is nebulised beta 2-adrenergic agents such as salbutamol, given with corticosteroids. However, penetration of the drug to the small airways is impeded by obstruction so intravenous salbutamol may be more effective. We assessed the use of intravenous salbutamol in the management of children with acute severe asthma in a double-blind randomised study. In this phase (0 h-2 h) treatment was by a standard protocol: nebulised salbutamol at the above dose: 4 L/min or 6 L/min continuous oxygen until oxygen saturation reached 93% in room air for at least 30 min; a bolus of intravenous hydrocortisone 5 mg/kg given over 3 min; and then 15 micrograms/kg intravenous salbutamol or saline, depending on randomised allocation. All children were transferred to the ward once they were ready to start hourly nebulisation. The intravenous salbutamol group were ready for discharge from the emergency department 9.7 h earlier than the control group.</s><s>In patients with acute severe asthma, 5 mg of terbutaline by inhalation and 500 microgram intravenously in divided doses both produced equally effective but not maximal bronchodilatation.

The patients were given 14/190 mg metoprolol, 100 mg atenolol, and placebo once daily for a 7-day period each in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design. At the estimated time of peak plasma concentrations, cumulative doses of salbutamol (12.5, 37.5, 112.5, 412.5, 812.5, and 1612.5 micrograms) were applied every 20 minutes. The slopes of the salbutamol dose-response curves of specific airway conductance did not differ on day 1 (P > .05). The median cumulative salbutamol concentrations causing a 50% increase in specific airway conductance were 416 and 384 micrograms (days 1 and 7, respectively) for placebo, 594 and 444 micrograms for metoprolol, and 562 and 1419 micrograms for atenolol.</s><s>Celiprolol, a new beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, blocks serotonin- and methacholine-mediated bronchoconstriction in animals, even in the presence of propranolol. Pulmonary function was measured after single doses of each agent, and again following subsequent, graded doses of albuterol or isoproterenol aerosol. Changes in one-second forced expiratory volume (FEV1) and maximal midexpiratory flow rate (FEF25-75) prior to albuterol or isoproterenol were positive after placebo and both doses of celiprolol. Propranolol, and to a lesser extent, atenolol, caused significant reductions in both measures of pulmonary function. Overall changes in FEV1 following each drug plus isoproterenol or albuterol were positive, in the rank order, celiprolol approximately placebo greater than atenolol greater than propranolol.</s><s>The cardioselectivity and hypotensive properties of the beta 1-specific beta-blocker bisoprolol were investigated using a single-dose comparison of 10 and 20 mg bisoprolol, 100 mg atenolol, and placebo in 12 hypertensive asthmatic patients. The study was of a randomised four-way crossover design with 1 week's washout between each treatment. 100 mg atenolol and 10 and 20 mg bisoprolol reduced HR, SBP, and DBP 2 h postmedication. Following all treatments, salbutamol did not affect cardiovascular parameters, but significantly reduced AWR and increased PEFR, FEV1, and VC without any significant differences between groups. An equipotent beta 1-adrenoceptor-blocking dose of atenolol (100 mg), compared with 10 and 20 mg bisoprolol, was found to increase airway resistance in the population of asthmatic patients studied. Bisoprolol has been shown to exhibit a greater beta 1-selectivity than atenolol.</s><s>The effects of labetalol, metoprolol, and placebo on pulmonary function and their interaction with isoproterenol were evaluated in 18 patients with reversible bronchial asthma [isoproterenol-induced increase in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of greater than or equal to 15%]. Two dose levels of each medication were studied (on consecutive days), with the lower doses of these drugs given randomly. When isoproterenol was administered following labetalol (200 and 400 mg), FEV1 further increased with a resulting combined increase of 18.9 and 19.7%, respectively, indicating an additive interaction. Labetalol may be a safer antihypertensive than metoprolol in patients with concomitant bronchial asthma.</s><s>The effects of two cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocking agents--celiprolol (claimed to have bronchodilator properties) and atenolol (without such claims)--on respiratory function and control of asthma were studied in ten asthmatic patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. When given acutely, celiprolol appeared to have acute bronchosparing properties, possibly providing a greater margin of respiratory safety than atenolol.</s><s>The effects of single oral doses of atenolol 50 mg and xamoterol 200 mg (a recently developed partial beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist) on lung function, heart rate and blood pressure were investigated in 11 patients with asthma. There was no significant difference between the effects of atenolol and xamoterol of FEV1 and FVC.</s><s>Effects of exercise on practolol-treated asthmatic patients.</s><s>This double-blind, randomised, within patient, placebo-controlled study set out to investigate the effect of a cardioselective beta-blocker, atenolol, at different oral doses (50, 100 and 200 mg) and a non-selective agent, propranolol (40 mg), upon 1. airways resistance (forced expiratory volume at one second = FEV1) and 2. the bronchodilator action of increasing doses of inhaled isoprenaline, in patients with co-existent hypertension and reversible airways obstruction. In 10 patients, two hours after drug administration, the 3 doses of atenolol caused a significantly greater (P less than 0.05) degree of B1-blockade than propranolol. Such a treatment will be less likely to cause a troublesome increase in airways resistance and the bronchodilator action of the beta 2 stimulant will be almost fully preserved.</s><s>In a double-blind, within-patient, randomized study, 12 mild asthmatics were given single oral doses of propranolol (80 mg), metoprolol (100 mg), timolol (10 mg), or placebo. Resting heart rate and forced expiratory volume in one sec (FEV1) were measured before and 90 min after treatment. Nonspecific bronchial reactivity was measured by inhaled histamine at 90 min. Following each active drug, resting heart rate changed to a similar extent and to a greater degree than after placebo (p less than 0.01). We conclude that, in mild asthmatics, nonspecific bronchial reactivity is a more sensitive index of airway effects than resting FEV1.</s><s>The effect of the beta 1-selective adrenoceptor blocker, metoprolol, on ventilatory function was studied in eight asthmatic patients in relation to the plasma level of the agent following its administration in ordinary and slow-release tablets. The effect was most pronounced after administration of 200 mg in ordinary tablets, which induced the highest plasma levels. This study indicates, that when a larger dose of metoprolol is used in patients with obstructive lung disease, slow-release durules are to be preferred to ordinary tablets.</s><s>Ventilation, heart rate, and arterial blood gas tensions were measured at rest and during incremental exercise in 10 patients with emphysema after intravenous placebo or 7 mg metoprolol. Metoprolol reduced heart rate by 14% (P less than 0.001) and ventilation by 11% (P less than 0.01), but there was no significant difference in arterial O2 or CO2 tension (Pao2 and PaCO2, respectively). During steady-state exercise on a cycle ergometer, atenolol and metoprolol reduced ventilation by 14 and 4%, respectively. There were no significant changes in tests of exercise tolerance, but forced expiratory volume in 1 s and forced vital capacity were reduced during beta 1-adrenergic blockade. beta 1-Blocking drugs reduce hyperventilation in emphysema by reducing pulmonary gas exchange without a change in arterial blood gas tensions. Increased airflow obstruction prevents this reduction being of therapeutic value.</s><s>The effects on lung function of labetalol (a combined alpha and beta adrenergic receptor blocker) and three beta adrenergic receptor blockers (propranolol, atenolol, metoprolol) have been assessed in patients with chronic airflow obstruction using a double-blind trial. With the dosages used, all drugs produced an equivalent fall of blood pressure.</s><s>In a double blind, placebo-controlled study the ventilatory effects of the beta 1-selective receptor blockers bisoprolol (EMD 33512) and metoprolol and their interactions with the beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist terbutaline were investigated in 8 asthmatic patients. Both beta-blockers, in all the doses given, caused a significant decrease in peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR). Terbutaline inhalation caused the same significant improvements in FEV1 and PEFR during placebo as during bisoprolol 10 mg, bisoprolol 20 mg and metoprolol 100 mg. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) decreased significantly after bisoprolol 20 mg and metoprolol 100 mg, but not after bisoprolol 10 mg. Inhalation of terbutaline up to a dose of 3.5 mg had no influence on HR and BP.</s><s>The aim of the study was to compare the pulmonary effects of four beta-blockers with different ancillary properties: propranolol (non-beta 1 selective without ISA), oxprenolol (non-beta 1 selective with ISA), atenolol (beta 1 selective), and celipropol (beta 1 selective with mild beta 2-agonist and alpha 2-antagonist activity) in hypertensive patients with chronic obstructive lung disease. Entry criteria were a) DBP greater than or equal to 95 mmHg and less than or equal to 115 mmHg; b) FEV1 less than 70% of the theoretical values; c) FEV1 increase of at least 20% after salbutamol inhalation (200 micrograms). Unlike propranolol and oxprenolol, which significantly reduced FEV1 and inhibited the bronchodilator response to inhaled salbutamol, atenolol and celiprolol did not significantly affect respiratory function and did not antagonize salbutamol effects.</s><s>1 Cardiovascular and airways response to two non-cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, propranolol and pindolol (with partial agonist activity) and two cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, acebutolol (with partial agonist activity) and atenolol, were compared in twelve patients with asthma. In the remaining five patients, bronchoconstriction was greatest following propranolol (mean reduction in FEV1 26.6%) and least following atenolol (mean reduction in FEV1 6.5%). 4 The bronchodilator response to inhaled isoprenaline was blocked by propranolol and pindolol but not by acebutolol and atenolol.</s><s>In order to localize the main site of action of the beta 2-adrenoceptor selective agonist terbutaline and the beta 1-adrenoceptor selective antagonist atenolol in the airways of asthmatic patients, we compared the effects of these drugs on maximal expiratory flow-volume (MEFV) curves when breathing air and when breathing a helium-oxygen (HeO2) mixture. Doubling the dose of inhaled terbutaline to 4 mg did not result in any further improvement of lung function. This was partly due to large inter- and intra-individual variations of this parameter. Another possibility is that atenolol and terbutaline effect large and small airways function equally.</s><s>-Adrenergic blockade with practolol in acetylcholine-sensitive asthma patients.</s><s>In a randomized, blind crossover study in 14 hypertensive patients with asthma, involving placebo and chronically administered (3 weeks) equipotent beta1-blocking doses of atenolol 100 mg once daily and metoprolol 100 mg bid, atenolol and metoprolol produced a similar fall in blood pressure.</s><s>Eight asthmatic patients were investigated in a double-blind cross-over study after oral administration of 100 mg atenolol, 10 mg metoprolol and placebo. The infusions were given for 6 min on each dose level with 30-min intervals. No differences between effects of the two beta-blockers were shown in reduction of heart rate and FEV1, before and during the terbutaline treatments.</s><s>The cardioequipotency of 400 mg bevantolol and 100 mg atenolol was determined by measuring the exercise heart rate in healthy subjects. The beta-blockers were then used in these doses to investigate their ventilatory effects in patients with asthma. Both beta-blockers decreased the maximal expiratory flow rates at 50% of forced vital capacity (MEF50) and after expiration of 75% of the forced vital capacity (MEF25) at rest; the decrease was larger after bevantolol than after atenolol. During atenolol there was a decrease in FEV1 and in PEFR (P less than 0.01) 15 minutes after exercise in comparison with preexercise values. There was no significant difference between pre- and postexercise values of MEF50 and MEF25 during atenolol dosing.</s><s>The interaction of these drugs with increasing doses of isoprenaline on the same variables was also studied. Both beta-blockers reduced the basal forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and the effect tended to be more pronounced after propranolol. The results show a selectivity of metoprolol for so-called beta1-receptors and indicate that metoprolol may be used in asthmatics provided that it is combined with beta2-receptor-stimulating drugs.</s><s>The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of celiprolol, a new beta-blocking drug, on the clinical condition and pulmonary function of hypertensive patients with reversible bronchial obstruction. Celiprolol was compared with chlorthalidone, an antihypertensive drug without known effect on bronchial tone. Prophylactic medication for asthma was given in constant dosage for a month before the study and throughout the study. Preliminary results on 66 patients demonstrate that neither drug had a clinically significant effect on FEV-1, FEF 25-75, or FVC. Clinical variables were not significantly changed by either drug: the average monthly asthma attacks fell from 18 to 13 with celiprolol and from 11 to 7 with chlorthalidone. FEF was reduced by more than 50% in two patients on celiprolol and three on chlorthalidone.</s><s>Sixteen normotensive asthmatic patients received single doses of 400 and 600 mg of celiprolol and 100 mg of atenolol in this placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study. Changes in forced one-second expiratory volume (FEV1) and mid-maximal expiratory flow (MMEF) following both doses of celiprolol were indistinguishable from the effects of placebo, whereas atenolol caused a significant reduction in both measurements of pulmonary function. Graded doses of albuterol, a beta 2-selective sympathomimetic administered at 15-min intervals starting 3 h after each treatment, as expected, caused bronchodilation.</s><s>Dilevalol combines a nonselective blocking action on beta-receptors with selective beta 2-agonist activity. When the lowest or minimum values observed during the 2 h postdrug evaluation period were considered, there was no significant difference from baseline in the percentage change in FEV1 after placebo (-4.4%) and dilevalol (-10%), with the difference between these treatments not being statistically significant. Both dilevalol and metoprolol similarly and significantly (p less than or equal to 0.01) inhibited the isoproterenol (160 and 480 micrograms) response in FEV1 as compared to placebo.</s><s>Cardioselectivity of a single oral dose of metoprolol oral osmotic (OROS) (14/190 mg) and atenolol (100 mg) was compared in 12 patients with reversible obstructive airway disease by assessing the dose-response curve to increasing doses of inhaled salbutamol. Both metoprolol and atenolol significantly reduced forced vital capacity and peak expiratory flow, with no difference between drugs. The results indicate that the new OROS delivery system for metoprolol, which produces a relatively constant plasma drug level, provides a cardioselectivity comparable to or greater than that of atenolol at maximum plasma levels.</s><s>We evaluated the effects of oral metoprolol, 200 mg daily, on cardiac and pulmonary function in 6 patients with chronic reversible airways obstruction and no cardiac dysfunction. In all patients, baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was less than 60% predicted, and increased at least 15% after isoproterenol inhalation. Compared to placebo, metoprolol did not significantly affect FEV1 or forced vital capacity. Metoprolol did not significantly alter left or right ventricular ejection fraction, measured by first pass radionuclide technique.</s><s>Ventilatory and haemodynamic effects of beta 1-selective and beta 2-selective stimulation in asthmatic patients.</s><s>Ltd) (300 mg) and acebutolol (Sectral, May & Baker Ltd) (300 mg) were compared in a placebo-controlled, crossover study in ten asthmatics. Pulse rate, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and specific airways conductance were measured before and after a bronchodilator and the same procedure was repeated after taking acebutolol, practolol or placebo. A mean increase in resting airways obstruction and reduction in bronchodilator response were evident with both drugs. In any individual the beta-adrenoceptor blocking response is unpredictable and any beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug must be used with extreme caution in asthmatics.</s>"

The penile block was achieved by injecting bupivacaine into the two compartments of the subpubic space, with an additional ventral infiltration of a small volume of bupivacaine along the raphe of the penis. Penile block shortened the induction-incision time and enabled earlier discharge home compared with caudal block. One patient undergoing penile block and nine patients undergoing caudal block vomited. Penile and caudal block are equally effective for postcircumcision analgesia and neither is associated with serious complications.</s><s>In 40 children scheduled for circumcision, we studied the quality and the adverse effects of postoperative analgesia induced by caudal block (group 1) or acetaminophen by rectal route (group 2).</s><s>Ketamine has been shown to prolong analgesia produced by caudal local anaesthetic block and is now in common use. There was no difference between the groups in time to first requirement for analgesia or number of doses of paracetamol given in the first 24 h. Almost half the boys in the caudal group had motor weakness, and there was a significant increase in time to first micturition in that group. Caudal anaesthesia with bupivacaine/ketamine does not confer any advantage over a dorsal nerve block with the doses used in this study.

This was seen especially in patients with bacteriologically proven infections where the isolated staphylococci and streptococci were more susceptible to Imi. Duration of fever was significantly shorter in the Imi group (4 days vs 7 days, p < 0.04). Our results show that monotherapy with imipenem is superior to the combination of tobramycin and cefuroxime during the first 72 h of therapy and can be safely administered to neutropenic patients with predominantly Gram-positive infections.

Cefepime was demonstrated to be an effective and safe treatment for febrile episodes in neutropenic patients with malignancies, and its lack of nephrotoxicity compared to P+G was noteworthy. Cefepime appears to be a candidate for monotherapy in febrile neutropenic cancer patients.</s><s>The treatment of infectious complications in cancer patients has evolved as a consequence of the developments in the chemotherapy of cancer patients. Of 30 evaluable episodes, 15 were treated with imipenem-cilastatin and 15 were treated with sulbactam-cefoperazone plus amikacin. 73% of episodes were culture-positive: gram-positive pathogens accounted for 62% of the isolates.</s><s>Meropenem is the first of a new class of carbapenems which may be administered without cilastatin. This study was performed to assess the clinical efficacy and tolerability of meropenem monotherapy (1 g/8 h) compared with the standard combination of ceftazidime (2 g/8 h) plus amikacin (15 mg/kg/day) for the empirical treatment of infective febrile episodes in neutropenic cancer patients. There was a high incidence of Gram-positive infections but no pseudomonal infections. Meropenem was well tolerated; of note, there were no cases of nausea/vomiting or seizure related to its use. The low overall success rates with both treatments concur with those of other recent studies and are probably due to a combination of several factors, including the adoption of strict assessment criteria.</s><s>A prospective randomized study was conducted to determine the efficacy of imipenem-cilastatin (hereafter referred to as imipenem) (500 mg four times daily) versus combination therapy for febrile neutropenic patients receiving either no prophylaxis or ciprofloxacin for prevention of infections. Ninety-four neutropenic fever episodes in 87 patients were evaluable for efficacy. Two of 29 gram-positive bacteria were imipenem resistant, whereas 10 were resistant to cephalothin and cefuroxime and 12 were resistant to gentamicin. The difference in distribution proved to be statistically significant for gram-negative (P = 0.0001) as well as gram-positive (P = 0.025) bacteria, indicating that ciprofloxacin effectively prevented the occurrence of gram-negative bacteria and may have contributed to the relatively large number of gram-positive bacteria isolated. Empirical initial therapy with imipenem may be a valuable alternative to combination therapy for neutropenic fever episodes.</s><s>In this open, controlled, randomized multi-clinic trial, monotherapy with imipenem/cilastatin was compared to amikacin plus piperacillin as empiric antibacterial therapy in 210 neutropenic cancer patients. Of patients randomized, 53 (25%) had bacteriologically documented infections and of those 30 had septicemia. Among evaluable patients with septicemia, one patient in the imipenem/cilastatin group had persistent Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia during treatment. Five patients in the amikacin plus piperacillin group had persistent bacteremia during treatment; all but one (a Pseudomonas aeruginosa) caused by strains resistant to amikacin or piperacillin. Clinical and laboratory adverse effects were mild in the imipenem/cilastatin group although nausea was significantly more common than in the amikacin plus piperacillin group. Drug-related serious adverse events were reported in two additional amikacin plus piperacillin patients; one with drug fever and one with hearing loss. Microbiological adverse effects occurred in similar frequencies in the two groups.</s><s>1998, a consensus meeting was held in Miyazaki, Japan, to develop an approach to management of febrile neutropenia (FN). Patients who developed fever with neutrophil counts <1,000/microL were randomized to receive either a single antibiotic, cefepime or one of the carbapenems, or a combination of cefepime and an aminoglycoside. Patients who became afebrile within the first 3 days were continued on the same treatment. Microbiologically documented infection was seen in 6.5% for monotherapy, and 10.5% for a combination treatment, and fever of unknown origin occurred in 75.3% and 59.2% of the patients in each regimen, respectively. Excellent to good response was seen in two-thirds of the patients in all treatment groups.</s><s>Neutropenic patients with cancer are traditionally treated with empiric antibiotic combinations when they become febrile. The availability of broad-spectrum antibiotics such as ceftazidime and imipenem has made it possible to initiate therapy with a single agent (monotherapy). The objectives of this trial were to compare ceftazidime and imipenem as single agents for the therapy of febrile episodes in neutropenic patients and to ascertain whether the addition of an aminoglycoside (amikacin) to either of these agents would provide an advantage. A prospective clinical trial was conducted in which eligible neutropenic patients with cancer were randomized to one of four treatment arms: ceftazidime alone; imipenem alone; ceftazidime plus amikacin; and imipenem plus amikacin. A multivariate logistic-regression analysis was also performed to examine the unique contribution of various prognostic factors. Most responded to vancomycin or other antibiotics, and the mortality associated with gram-positive infections was only 5%.</s><s>Efficacy and costs of empirical antibacterial therapy in febrile neutropenic patients are important issues. Piperacillin-tazobactam monotherapy is promising, but its role in this setting still has to be defined. Of 212 consecutive febrile episodes in 130 neutropenic patients with hematological malignancies randomized to receive either piperacillin-tazobactam (4.5 g every 8 h; group A) or ceftriaxone (2 g once daily plus gentamicin 5 mg/kg once daily; group B), 183 episodes (98 group A, 85 group B) were evaluable for response. All patients still febrile then received meropenem, teicoplanin and amphotericin B. With these modifications of antibiotic therapy, 89.8% of patients in group A had responded at 21 days but only 71.8% in group B (P=0.005).</s><s>To compare piperacillin and tobramycin with ceftazidime alone for the empiric treatment of fever in the neutropenic patient without evidence of skin infections or anaerobic infections. Treatment could be modified at any time at the discretion of the investigator. Percentage of satisfactory response, eradication of the infecting organism, development of superinfections, and occurrence of adverse events. As a single agent, ceftazidime was as effective as the combination of piperacillin and tobramycin (62.7% satisfactory responses compared with 61.1%; odds ratio, 1.07%; 95% Cl, 0.79 to 1.44; P > 0.2). Infectious mortality was 6% for ceftazidime and 8% for the combination therapy.</s><s>Efficacy of the ceftazidime monotherapy in 120 febrile children with neoplastic diseases and granulocytopenia was compared with that of tobramycin combined with amoxycillin/ampicillin. Isolated bacteria were more sensitive to ceftazidime than to tobramycin with amoxycillin/ampicillin. Despite a low number of patients in both groups, one may conclude that ceftazidime is more efficient in patients with granulocytopenia.</s><s>Piperacillin as a single agent was compared in a prospective randomized trial with carboxypenicillin-aminoglycoside combinations in empirical therapy of serious bacterial infections. However, the emergence of resistant organisms during therapy was more frequent among patients receiving piperacillin alone (42% of patients) than among patients receiving combination therapy (17% of patients) (P = 0.465 by Fisher's exact test). Moreover, emergence of resistance accounted for 5 of 9 patients with treatment failure, superinfection, or both when piperacillin was used as a single agent, compared with 2 of 10 similar patients in the combination group (P = 0.1299 by Fisher's exact test).</s><s>Infection remains the major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised children with malignancy. In our center between January 1998 and January 1999, 73 children with hematological malignancies [acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML)]; 9 children with solid tumors (rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma) had 87 febrile neutropenic episodes (related to chemotherapy). The aim of the study was to compare the success rates and cost of fourth generation cephalosporin plus aminoglycoside and monotherapy of meropenem with ceftazidime plus amikacin, which is the standard therapy for febrile neutropenia. Gram-positive microorganisms were the most commonly isolated agents from blood cultures [MRSA (Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus) in 6 patients and MSSA (Methicillin Sensitive Staphylococcus aureus) in 4 patients]. The success rates were 78.5%, 79.3% and 73.3 % for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd groups respectively.</s><s>The empirical use of antibiotic treatments is widely accepted as a means to treat cancer patients in chemotherapy who have fever and neutropenia. Intravenous monotherapy, with broad spectrum antibiotics, of patients with a high risk of complications is a possible alternative. The mean neutrophil counts at admission were 217cells/mm(3) (T) and 201cells/mm(3) (C+A). Treatment was considered to have failed because of death in two episodes (3%) in the T group and three episodes (4%) in the C+A group, and because of a change in the drug applied in one episode in the T group and two episodes in the C+A group. Adverse events that occurred in group T were not related to the drugs used in this study. It should be considered an appropriate option for this group of patients at high risk for infections.</s><s>In a prospective study, 157 patients with prolonged aplasia (PMN less than 500/mm3 during more than 21 days), hospitalized in a protected environment unit, were randomly assigned to receive ceftazidime alone or cefotaxime + tobramycin for initial febrile episodes. Patients were evaluated for their initial response to antibiotics (defervescence in 48 hours, maintained 7 days) and long term response (prevention of another infection during aplasia). The overall initial response to ceftazidime was 48/71 (68 per cent) and to cefotaxime + tobramycin 55/86 (64 per cent).</s><s>Efficacy of the cephalosporin, ceftriaxone, was compared with that of the combination of the aminoglycoside, netilmicin, and the penicillin, azlocillin, in the treatment of febrile episodes in immunocompromised neutropenic children undergoing chemotherapy for neoplastic disease. During 100 separate febrile episodes, 40 strains of bacteria were isolated from the blood of 34 patients and a further 55 strains from other sites. Nine strains (four of which were staphylococci) to both netilmicin and azlocillin. Ceftriaxone had the considerable practical advantages of once daily dosage without a need for blood monitoring.</s><s>To evaluate the efficacy of ceftazidime monotherapy in the empirical treatment of febrile neutropenic patients, a randomized trial was performed of ceftazidime (C) vs. ceftazidime and gentamicin (C + G) with the addition of teicoplanin (T) for those patients with a long intravenous line-associated infection.</s><s>High-intensity regimes of chemotherapy have led to longer and more severe episodes of neutropenia with a resulting increase in morbidity and mortality due to infections. Patients were randomized to receive either cefepime or ceftriaxone plus amikacin. Both treatment and control groups were comparable for age and sex, among other factors. There were 18 cures in the cefepime group and 17 in the ceftriaxone plus amikacin group (p = 0.9). Cefepime is a safe and very effective therapy for patients with acute leukemia and febrile neutropenia; in addition, it is a cheaper regimen in our country, and lacks the potential toxicity of the aminoglycosides.</s><s>We conducted a randomized trial to compare the efficacy of imipenem/cilastatine (IPM/CS) monotherapy with that of a combination of latamoxef (LMOX) and tobramycin (TOB) in the initial management of fever and neutropenia in patients with lung cancer. The response rate in severely neutropenic patients (neutrophils less than 100/microliters) was low (P = 0.078). Three patients in the IPM/CS group were withdrawn from the study due to skin rash and vomiting.</s><s>Although the effectiveness of antibiotic monotherapy in febrile neutropenic patients remains unproven, ceftazidime has been shown previously to be effective monotherapy for the empiric treatment of selective patients. Of the evaluable 89 patients, 45 received ceftazidime and 44 received ceftazidime plus tobramycin for 5 to 10 days. At the end of therapy, 30 (67%) of the 45 ceftazidime-treated patients were clinically cured compared with 38 (86%) of 44 combination-treated patients.</s><s>The efficacy and tolerability of monotherapy with imipenem-cilastatin (I-C) were compared with that of ceftazidime plus full-course therapy with an aminoglycoside (tobramycin) (C&T) in the treatment of presumed bacterial infection in neutropenic cancer patients. Forty-five patients in the I-C group and 41 in the C&T group, who were well matched on demographic and baseline characteristics, were evaluable for efficacy and safety. Seventy-two hours after the start of therapy, no significant between-group differences in treatment outcomes, including withdrawals or deaths, were seen. Thirty-five (78%) of 45 patients in the I-C group and 29 (71%) of the 41 in the C&T group had successful outcomes at the final evaluation. The data suggest that imipenem-cilastatin should be considered for initial empiric therapy of presumed bacterial infection in neutropenic cancer patients.</s><s>The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of piperacillin/tazobactam (PIP/TAZO) versus PIP/TAZO plus amikacin in febrile neutropenic children with acute leukemia (AL). Modification was defined as addition of other antimicrobials and/or antifungal agents to the empirical therapy. Seventy-two febrile episodes of 42 patients with a median age of 4.5 years (3.5 months to 19 years) were evaluated. There were 37 and 35 episodes in PIP/TAZO and combination arms, respectively. Empirical therapy was substituted by other drugs in 6 and 5 episodes in PIP/TAZO and combination arms, respectively. Monotherapy with PIP/TAZO was effective and safe for initial empirical treatment of febrile neutropenic episodes in children with AL. However, local bacterial resistance patterns should be considered in daily practice.</s><s>One hundred and two patients with neutropenia (less than 1 x 10(9)/L) secondary to primary hematological disorders or chemotherapy for hematological malignancies were prospectively randomised, upon the development of fever or other signs of infection, to receive empirical antibiotic treatment with either ceftazidime (+/- flucloxacillin) (n = 52) or azlocillin plus amikacin (+/- flucloxacillin) (A&A, n = 50). When assessed at 96 hours, the complete response rates were 59.6% for the ceftazidime treated patients and 44% for A&A treated patients. Separate analysis of those patients who did not receive flucloxacillin yielded identical results.</s><s>The purpose of this study was to compare meropenem monotherapy with combination therapy for empirical treatment of neutropenic fever in children with lymphoma and solid tumors. The success with meropenem was comparable to that seen with piperacillin plus amikacin: 76.6 versus 64.6 percent (p = 0.25). The solid tumor group had significantly less bacteremia (4/34 versus 17/56; p < 0.05) and treatment failure (3/34 versus 24/56; p < 0.001) than the NHL group.</s><s>The efficacy, safety, and cost of cefepime and ceftazidime + amikacin as empirical therapy in children with febrile neutropenia is compared. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either cefepime 150 mg/kg/day or ceftazidime 150 mg/kg/day combined with amikacin 15 mg/kg/day. Overall treatment success was 100% and success of initial empirical therapy without modification was 52 and 40% in the cefepime and cefepime + amikacin groups, respectively. Duration of fever, hospitalization, and antimicrobial drug administration were longer in the ceftazidime + amikacin arm. Cefepime monotherapy is as effective as ceftazidime + amikacin combination in febrile neutropenia of pediatric cancer patients and must be preferred due to shorter defervescence of fever, shorter hospitalization, and lower therapy cost.</s><s>69 febrile granulocytopenic episodes without an initial focus of infection were assessed for empiric treatment either with high-dose amikacin plus piperacillin or ceftazidime. 90% of patients in each group survived the granulocytopenic episode; 15 (44 +/- 17%) episodes treated with the combination and 23 (66 +/- 16%) given ceftazidime responded without any modification of initial therapy and half defervesced within 72 h. Persistent fever was the most frequent reason for altering treatment which was done empirically in 90% of cases, but two-thirds of patients required further treatment modification. An infectious focus mainly involving the lung developed during granulocytopenia in 21 patients (30%), of which 17 occurred during antimicrobial therapy. Therapy with the combination resulted in a higher serum creatinine (p less than 0.001) and a lower potassium level (p less than 0.001) in comparison with monotherapy.</s><s>A prospective study was conducted in 10 haematology departments of university hospitals on 174 leukaemic patients with prolonged bone marrow aplasia and presenting with a febrile episode. The two treatment group were similar as regards age, sex, underlying blood disease, duration of neutropenia, presence of a venous catheter, type of digestive tract contamination, clinical and bacteriological findings. There was no significant difference in terms of success or failure between the two treatment groups. Ceftazidime administered as monotherapy proved as effective as the cefotaxime-amikacin combination in the empirical first-line treatment of febrile episodes in leukaemic patients with neutropenia.</s><s>Empirical therapy with cefoperazone was compared with cefoperazone plus amikacin in granulocytopenic and nongranulocytopenic febrile patients. In nonneutropenic patients the overall response rate to cefoperazone was 88%; 10 of 12 gram-negative bacteremic patients were cured.</s><s>Three-hundred and twelve episodes of fever in 234 neutropenic patients with haematological malignancies were treated empirically with either imipenem or a combination of piperacillin and gentamicin. There were no significant differences in the percentages of patients responding to therapy at either 72 h (59% and 56% of assessable episodes in the imipenem and combination groups respectively) or at the end of treatment (55% and 53% of assessable episodes in the imipenem and combination groups respectively).</s><s>Hospitalization with single or multi-agent antibiotic therapy has been the standard of care for treatment of febrile neutropenia in cancer patients. Febrile pediatric cancer patients with anticipated prolonged neutropenia were randomized between a regimen of once-daily ceftriaxone plus amikacin (C + A) and imipenem monotherapy (control). We compared the outcome, adverse events, duration of hospitalization, and cost between both groups. There was no statistically significant difference in the response to treatment at 72 hr or after necessary antimicrobial modifications. We conclude that pediatric febrile cancer patients initially considered at risk for sepsis due to prolonged neutropenia can be re-evaluated at 72 hr for outpatient therapy. The convenience, low incidence of adverse effects, and cost benefit of the once-daily regimen of C + A may be particularly useful to reduce the overall treatment costs and duration of hospitalization.</s><s>Fifty-two immunocompromised patients with suspected septicaemia were randomized on 61 occasions to treatment with ceftazidime or with tobramycin and cefuroxime. Blood cultures were positive in 22 (39%) febrile episodes and in four other instances positive cultures were obtained from other sources. Clinical cure or improvement was noted in 10 of 12 culture verified infections in the tobramycin and cefuroxime group and 11 of 14 episodes in the ceftazidime-group. However, an increase in the urinary excretion of AAP was seen in both groups with significantly greater elevation in the tobramycin and cefuroxime group.</s><s>Combinations of beta-lactams plus aminoglycosides have been standard therapy for suspected infections in granulocytopenic cancer patients, especially those with profound long-lasting granulocytopenia. With the advent of new broad-spectrum bactericidal antibiotics such as extended-spectrum cephalosporins or carbapenems, the need to combine beta-lactams with aminoglycosides became more controversial. The objective of this prospective randomized multicenter study was to compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerance of meropenem monotherapy with those of the combination of ceftazidime plus amikacin for the empirical treatment of fever in granulocytopenic cancer patients. Of 1,034 randomized patients, 958 were assessable in the intent-to-treat analysis for response to antibacterial therapy, including 483 in the meropenem group and 475 in the ceftazidime-plus-amikacin group. The success rates in the monotherapy group and the combination group were similar by type of infection (single gram-negative bacteremia, single gram-positive bacteremia, clinically documented infection, and possible infection). Mortality due to the presenting infection or further infection was relatively low (8 patients treated with the monotherapy compared with 13 patients treated with the combination).</s><s>Comparative efficacy and toxicity of moxalactam and the combination of nafcillin and tobramycin in febrile granulocytopenic patients.</s><s>Between July 1993 and September 1996, 107 consecutive febrile episodes in 83 neutropenic cancer patients with a median age of 41 years were randomized to treatment either with piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5 g every 8 h i.v. Bacteremia was found in 37%, other microscopically documented infections in 16%, and clinically documented infections in 26% of the febrile episodes. No significant difference was found between piperacillin/ tazobactam and ceftazidime plus amikacin in terms of success rate (81% versus 83%), empirical addition of vancomycin (42% versus 38%), median time to fever defervescence (3.3 versus 2.9 days) or median duration of antibiotic therapy (7.2 versus 7.4 days). On the basis of the 107 febrile events encountered, we conclude that piperacillin/tazobactam is a safe and effective monotherapy.</s><s>A prospective, randomized clinical trial was conducted to compare the efficacy of piperacillin/tazobactam and amikacin combination with carbapenem monotherapy for the empirical treatment of febrile neutropenic episodes of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or acute myeloblastic leukemia. Response to antimicrobial therapy, evaluated for etiological agents, was measured. Duration of fever, neutropenia, and hospitalization, mortality, and the need for additional antibiotics or antifungal drugs were compared for the treatment success between the two groups. Out of 87 febrile neutropenic episodes that were evaluable for comparison, 46 patients received PTA and 41 patients were treated with carbapenems (imipenem or meropenem). Overall, the microbiologically documented infection rate was 21.9%, with Staphylococcus epidermidis as the most common cause of bacteremia.</s><s>A multicenter open randomized trial was conducted to compare cefepime monotherapy with cefepime/amikacin combination (dual) therapy in treating febrile neutropenic patients with hematologic disorders. At day 3, patients with neutrophil counts of <500/ mu L receiving dual therapy had a better response than did those receiving monotherapy (45% vs. 27.6%; P=.024). Further study is warranted for patients with severe neutropenia and leukemia who may benefit from dual therapy.</s><s>Infections remain the major cause of morbidity and mortality among neutropenic cancer patients. Seventy-one patients with hematological malignancies (55%) or solid tumors (45%), neutropenia < 500/microliter, and fever > 38.5 degrees C were randomly assigned to either meropenem (1 g every 8 h) or ceftazidime (2 g every 8 h) and amikacin (15 mg/kg/day) intravenously. This study suggests that meropenem monotherapy might be as effective as combination therapy with ceftazidime and amikacin for the empirical treatment of febrile neutropenic patients.</s>"

        "Abstracts": "<s>Postoperative air leaks are a major cause of morbidity after lung resections. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a new synthetic, bioresorbable surgical sealant in preventing air leaks after pulmonary resection. In a multicenter trial, 172 patients undergoing thoracotomy were randomized intraoperatively in a 2:1 ratio to receive surgical sealant applied to sites at risk for air leak after standard methods of lung closure (treatment group) or to have standard lung closure only (control group). Application of the sealant resulted in control of air leaks in 92% of treated patients (p < or = 0.001). A significantly higher percentage of treated patients than control patients remained free of air leaks during hospitalization (39% versus 11%, p < or =0.001). No significant difference was identified in postoperative morbidity and mortality between the two groups.</s><s>A controlled study concerning the surgical use of a fibrin glue was conducted in 50 patients undergoing partial pulmonary excision. In 25 of these patients, chosen at random, hemostasis and aerostasis of the fissural, and/or intersegmentary dissection planes were achieved by electrocoagulation, in the other 25 by the application of fibrin glue. This study seems to demonstrate that the surgical application of fibrin glue on the fissural and/or intersegmentary dissection planes is feasible but, as compared to electrocoagulation, does not significantly improve the quality of the surgical results for partial pulmonary excision; however its use could reduce the duration of post-operative drainage.</s><s>Alveolar air leaks are common after pulmonary resection, often prolonging hospitalization and increasing surgical morbidity and costs. This randomized and controlled trial evaluates 2 different surgical techniques for the completion of interlobar fissures during pulmonary lobectomy to establish which is superior in preventing air leakage. There were 20 patients in each of the 2 groups: Electrocautery was used for precision dissection and collagen patches were coated with human fibrinogen and thrombin (TachoSil, Nycomed, Vienna, Austria) for aerostasis in the electrocautery and sealant group (ES), and the approved routine surgical procedure with staplers was used in the stapler group (ST). Although this pilot study showed advantages in terms of hospitalization and cost benefits, further multicentric studies are required to clarify that these differences are statistically significant.</s><s>In order to investigate the effect of fibrin glueing on the treatment or prevention of air leakages, 114 patients undergoing pulmonary resections and pneumonectomies were studied in two treatment groups: surgery alone (59 patients) or analogous surgical treatment followed by the application of fibrin glue (55 patients). The patients were randomly assigned to treatment groups within two strata: pulmonary resections (63 patients) and pneumonectomies (51 patients). Treatment with fibrin glue reduced the incidence of postoperative leakages significantly from 66% in the control group to 39% in the treatment group (one-sided P-value < 0.02; estimated risk reduction 41%; 95% confidence interval 2-65%).</s><s>Persisting air leakage after pulmonary resection remains a significant problem. The aim of the study was to evaluate the incidence of air leakage after standard lobectomy and test the efficacy and safety of TachoComb (TC). Air leakage was assessed by water submersion test, and scored as grades 0 if no, 1 if countable, 2 if a stream of and 3 if coalescent bubbles have been observed. The reduction of intra-operative air leak intensity in the subgroup with grades 1-2 was significantly higher for the TC group (P=0.015). Postoperative air leakage intensity in the subgroup with air leakage grades 1-2 was lower for TC than standard treatment (P=0.047).</s><s>Intraoperative use of fibrin glue has been advocated in reducing postthoracotomy alveolar air leak, although most studies have not been randomized and have focused on its routine use after lung resection. During a 24-month period, 66 patients undergoing lobectomies, segmentectomies, or decortication were randomized either to serve as controls (n = 33) or to have fibrin glue sprayed on the \"raw\" lung surface (n = 33). Fibrin glue does not add to conventional techniques in reducing moderate to severe alveolar air leak after thoracic operations.</s><s>The intraoperative application of synthetic surgical lung sealant (SLS) to surfaces leaking air or at risk of air leaks has been advocated to reduce alveolar air leaks (AAL) after lobectomy. Over 17 months, 124 patients undergoing standard lobectomy were randomized to standard closure of parenchymal surgical sites, with or without SLS. In treated patients, the mean numbers of intraoperative AAL after application of SLS were significantly smaller than in untreated patients (38.5 mL versus 59.9 mL, p = 0.0401). In the treatment group, 4 patients developed localized empyema and incomplete lung expansion without bronchopleural fistula 7, 12, 15, and 20 days, respectively, after operation. Surgical lung sealant may be a useful adjunct to conventional techniques for reducing moderate and severe AAL after lobectomy, but its use seems to increase the risk of postoperative empyema.</s><s>Postoperative air leakage is the most frequent complication after pulmonary surgery. The development of modern surgical techniques has been influenced strongly by the need to manage air leakage effectively during pulmonary resection. Patients undergoing lobectomy were enrolled into two groups (Vivostat or non-treatment control, 20 per group). Significantly fewer patients had air leakage at any time in the Vivostat group (40 vs. 80%, P=0.02), and air leakage volumes were significantly lower compared with the control group (median differences: day of surgery: 0.6l/min, P=0.01; total 0.8l/min, P=0.03). Postoperative hospitalisation time was shorter in the Vivostat group than in the control group but the difference was not significant (0.5 days, P=0.12). Vivostat fibrin sealant significantly reduces post-surgical air leakage and drainage volumes following lobectomy in pulmonary surgery and is suitable for routine use in this procedure.</s><s>Air leaks after pulmonary resections may contribute to increased patient morbidity, delayed removal of chest drainage tubes, and prolonged hospitalization. In the experimental study, no postoperative air leaks occurred, with intact bronchial closures and normal tissues at death. Although 77% (n = 10) of treated patients remained leak-free from the end of the operation to chest tube removal versus 9% (n = 1) of control patients (P =.001), there was no statistical difference in the duration of postoperative chest tube time, hospital stay, or cost. There were no acute or late undesirable side-effects related to the sealant application. The surgical adhesive investigated here demonstrated a compelling safety profile and significant clinical efficacy to stop air leaks after lung resections.</s><s>The effectiveness of fibrin glue as a sealant to reduce postoperative air leaks after pulmonary lobectomy was evaluated in 28 consecutive patients between November 1988 and May 1989. The control group had a mean air leak duration of 3.3 +/- 3.3 days (p = 0.94), chest tube drains for 5.9 +/- 3.9 days (p = 0.95), and a postoperative hospitalization of 11.5 +/- 3.9 days (p = 0.21). We conclude that the routine use of a fixed quantity of fibrin glue is not effective in reducing the duration of air leaks, chest tube drainage, or hospitalization after uncomplicated pulmonary lobectomy.</s><s>The use of tissue glues has been advocated to reduce post-thoracotomy alveolar air leaks, but outcomes have been inconclusive. A prospective, randomized, single-blind, controlled trial was conducted in which patients were stratified according to the severity of post-thoracotomy air leak that could not be controlled by conventional surgical techniques. They were allocated to a control arm (surgical treatment only) or an interventional arm (surgical treatment and BioGlue). From December 2002 to January 2005, 52 patients were randomized, 29 (56%) of whom were men. The mean age was 59 +/- 15 years, and other characteristics were comparable in both groups. Systematic use of BioGlue may be warranted in adult thoracic surgical procedures (except pneumonectomy and decortication) when an air leak remains after all other steps to control it have failed.</s><s>In contrast to the rare large-airway bronchopleural fistulas after lung resection, peripheral or alveolar air leaks (AAL) are very common, often prolong hospital stay, increase utilization of resources, and on occasion result in significant morbidity. One of these, the topical application of fibrin glue, has to date failed to demonstrate efficacy in small clinical trials. Of 113 patients enrolled, 13 became ineligible because of intraoperative findings. The experimental group underwent application of 5 mL of fibrin glue delivered by a pressurized, aerosolized spraying mechanism. Postoperatively a blinded clinical observer recorded outcomes including the incidence and duration of AAL, prolonged AAL (PAAL), the volume of pleural drainage, the time to tube removal, and the postoperative length of stay (LOS), as well as any complications related to treatment. There was no significant difference in the volume of chest tube drainage or LOS (4.6 days glue and 4.9 days control, p = 0.318). The overall incidence of AAL was reduced by 50% and PAAL occurred in only 1 treated patient (2% versus the usually reported 15%).</s><s>Persistent air leakage following pulmonary resection is a major limiting factor for discharge from hospital. Grade 3 patients received standard treatment until the air leak was downgraded to grade 1 or 2 at which point they were randomised. Other efficacy measurements included mean time to chest drain removal and mean time to hospital discharge. The significant difference in air leakage volume observed intraoperatively post-treatment was maintained postoperatively. TachoSil showed a trend towards reduced incidence of postoperative leakage when measured >48h or >7 days after surgery (30.7% vs 38.96% and 24% vs 32.46%, respectively). The use of TachoSil following pulmonary resection resulted in a reduction in air leakage compared with standard techniques. This reduction in air leakage resulted in a significant reduction in both the time to chest drain removal and the period of hospitalisation.</s><s>To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a new biodegradable polymeric sealant to close intraoperative air leaks after pulmonary resection. The sealant group had significantly fewer patients with postoperative air leaks compared with the control group (65% vs 86%, p = 0.005). This study demonstrates the effectiveness of a biodegradable polymer when used as an adjunct to standard closure methods for sealing significant intraoperative air leaks that develop from pulmonary surgery. Use of the sealant led to a reduction in postoperative air leaks, which may have decreased the length of hospitalization.</s>"

Weight, waist circumference, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and most of the metabolic syndrome components decreased in the intervention group and increased in the controls after 12 months. The usual care by family physicians was ineffective at modifying progressive metabolic deterioration in high-risk individuals.</s><s>Type 2 diabetes affects approximately 8 percent of adults in the United States. Some risk factors--elevated plasma glucose concentrations in the fasting state and after an oral glucose load, overweight, and a sedentary lifestyle--are potentially reversible. The incidence of diabetes was 11.0, 7.8, and 4.8 cases per 100 person-years in the placebo, metformin, and lifestyle groups, respectively.

At 6 months, the groups differed significantly on measures of eating, exercise, and fitness; weight losses in the diet and diet-plus-exercise groups were significantly greater than in the exercise and control conditions. Differences between groups in risk of developing diabetes were of borderline significance (P = 0.08). Strongest predictors were impaired glucose tolerance at baseline, which was positively related to risk of developing diabetes, and weight loss from baseline to 2 years, which was negatively related; in all treatment groups, a modest weight loss of 4.5 kg reduced the risk of type 2 diabetes by approximately 30% compared with no weight loss. Although initially successful, the interventions studied here were not effective in producing long-term changes in behavior, weight, or physiological parameters.</s><s>Prevention of type 2 diabetes by intensive lifestyle intervention designed to achieve and maintain ideal body weight was assessed in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Male subjects with IGT recruited from health-screening examinees were randomly assigned in a 4:1 ratio to a standard intervention group (control group) and intensive intervention group (intervention group). The subjects in the control group and in the intervention group were advised to maintain body mass index (BMI) of <24.0 kg/m2 and of <22.0 kg/m2, respectively, by diet and exercise. A 100g oral glucose tolerance test was performed every 6 months to detect improvement of glucose tolerance. The cumulative 4-year incidence of diabetes was 9.3% in the control group, versus 3.0% in the intervention group, and the reduction in risk of diabetes was 67.4% (P < 0.001). Higher 2h plasma glucose values and higher BMI values at baseline were also associated with a higher incidence of diabetes, but the differences were not significant. Subjects with a low insulinogenic index (DeltaIRI/DeltaPG 30 min after an oral glucose load) developed diabetes at a significantly higher rate than those with a normal insulinogenic index. Comparison of the BMI data and incidence of diabetes in five diabetes prevention studies by lifestyle intervention revealed a linear correlation between the incidence of diabetes and the BMI values, with the exception of the DaQing Study. We conclude that lifestyle intervention aimed at achieving ideal body weight in men with IGT is effective and can be conducted in an outpatient clinic setting.</s><s>Individuals with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) have a high risk of developing NIDDM. The purpose of this study was to determine whether diet and exercise interventions in those with IGT may delay the development of NIDDM, i.e., reduce the incidence of NIDDM, and thereby reduce the overall incidence of diabetic complications, such as cardiovascular, renal, and retinal disease, and the excess mortality attributable to these complications. In 1986, 110,660 men and women from 33 health care clinics in the city of Da Qing, China, were screened for IGT and NIDDM. Subjects were randomized by clinic into a clinical trial, either to a control group or to one of three active treatment groups: diet only, exercise only, or diet plus exercise. Follow-up evaluation examinations were conducted at 2-year intervals over a 6-year period to identify subjects who developed NIDDM. Cox's proportional hazard analysis was used to determine if the incidence of NIDDM varied by treatment assignment. When analyzed by clinic, each of the active intervention groups differed significantly from the control clinics (P < 0.05).</s><s>To evaluate the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions in people with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Whole body insulin sensitivity, assessed by the short insulin tolerance test (ITT), improved after 12 months in the intervention group (0.52, 95% CI 0.15-0.89%/min). These findings complement the findings of the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study and the American Diabetes Prevention Study, both of which tested intensive interventions, by showing that pragmatic lifestyle interventions result in improvements in obesity and whole body insulin sensitivity in individuals with IGT, without change in other cardiovascular risk factors.</s><s>Type 2 diabetes mellitus is increasingly common, primarily because of increases in the prevalence of a sedentary lifestyle and obesity. We randomly assigned 522 middle-aged, overweight subjects (172 men and 350 women; mean age, 55 years; mean body-mass index [weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters], 31) with impaired glucose tolerance to either the intervention group or the control group. Each subject in the intervention group received individualized counseling aimed at reducing weight, total intake of fat, and intake of saturated fat and increasing intake of fiber and physical activity. An oral glucose-tolerance test was performed annually; the diagnosis of diabetes was confirmed by a second test. The mean (+/-SD) amount of weight lost between base line and the end of year 1 was 4.2+/-5.1 kg in the intervention group and 0.8+/-3.7 kg in the control group; the net loss by the end of year 2 was 3.5+/-5.5 kg in the intervention group and 0.8+/-4.4 kg in the control group (P<0.001 for both comparisons between the groups). Type 2 diabetes can be prevented by changes in the lifestyles of high-risk subjects.</s><s>Lifestyle modification helps in the primary prevention of diabetes in multiethnic American, Finnish and Chinese populations. In a prospective community-based study, we tested whether the progression to diabetes could be influenced by interventions in native Asian Indians with IGT who were younger, leaner and more insulin resistant than the above populations. We randomised 531 (421 men 110 women) subjects with IGT (mean age 45.9+/-5.7 years, BMI 25.8+/-3.5 kg/m(2)) into four groups. The relative risk reduction was 28.5% with LSM (95% CI 20.5-37.3, p=0.018), 26.4% with MET (95% CI 19.1-35.1, p=0.029) and 28.2% with LSM + MET (95% CI 20.3-37.0, p=0.022), as compared with the control group. The number needed to treat to prevent one incident case of diabetes was 6.4 for LSM, 6.9 for MET and 6.5 for LSM + MET.</s>"

Patient receiving PCEA showed a significant (p < 0.005) decrease of incident pain, while VPS at rest was similar in the two groups. It should be emphasized that incident pain is far more decreased by PCEA, so that this technique is particularly indicated when an early postoperative mobilization is required.</s><s>Continuous passive motion after major knee surgery optimizes the functional prognosis but causes severe pain. Pain was assessed at rest and during continuous passive motion using a visual analog scale. When the patients left the surgical ward, they were admitted to a rehabilitation center, where their length of stay depended on prospectively determined discharge criteria\n                The continuous epidural infusion and continuous femoral block groups showed significantly lower visual analog scale scores at rest and during continuous passive motion compared with the patient-controlled morphine group. On postoperative day 7, these values were 90 degrees (60-100 degrees)(median and 25th-75th percentiles) in the continuous epidural infusion group, 90 degrees (60-100 degrees) in the continuous femoral block group, and 80 degrees (60-100 degrees) in the patient-controlled morphine group (P < 0.05). Side effects were encountered more frequently in the continuous epidural infusion group. Regional analgesic techniques improve early rehabilitation after major knee surgery by effectively controlling pain during continuous passive motion, thereby hastening convalescence.</s><s>We have studied the effect of extradural analgesia on postoperative venous thrombosis in patients undergoing knee arthroplasty. Forty-eight patients were allocated randomly to receive either general anaesthesia or extradural analgesia with local anaesthetics for 3 days. One case of nonfatal pulmonary embolism occurred in a patient who received general anaesthesia. The use of continuous extradural analgesia resulted in a significant difference in the total incidence of deep vein thrombosis (18% compared with 59% after general anaesthesia (P = 0.02].</s><s>In this prospective, randomised, double-blind study, we investigated the effect of epidural anaesthesia and an antifibrinolytic agent, Aprotinin (500,000 KIU in bolus before surgery and 500,000 KIU h(-1) in drip form during surgery), on intra and postoperative blood loss and transfusion requirements in total hip arthroplasty. Total blood loss was reduced by 31.3% by epidural anaesthesia, 20.4% by Aprotinin and 51.4% using a combination of the two techniques.</s><s>Forty-two patients scheduled for total knee arthroplasty (n = 20) or hip arthroplasty (n = 22) were randomly allocated to receive either continuous epidural bupivacaine/morphine for 48 h postoperatively plus oral piroxicam, or general anaesthesia followed by a conventional intramuscular opioid and acetaminophen regimen. Patients undergoing knee- or hip arthroplasty treated with epidural analgesia had significantly lower pain scores during mobilization under the 48 h epidural infusion compared with patients receiving conventional treatment, while no important differences were observed after cessation of the epidural regimen. However, the achieved pain relief had no impact on postoperative convalescence parameters, such as ambulation, patient activity including need for nursing care, fatigue or hospital stay.</s><s>Twenty-one patients who had undergone total hip replacement were randomly assigned to one of three groups in order to compare a single dose of 1 mg/kg of pethidine im (I) and 20 mg (II) or 60 mg of extradural pethidine (III) in a double-blind design. Supplementary doses of oxycodone if required were given no earlier than 0.75 h after pethidine. Plasma concentrations of pethidine were measured with gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS). The area under the curve (AUC) of pain score versus time (0-18 h) was not significantly different between groups. The terminal half-lives and plasma clearances of pethidine, and the time to peak concentration were not different between the groups. Single patients in the extradural groups showed hypoalgesia to pin prick in parallel to the effect.</s><s>Evidence of pre-emptive analgetic effect of opioid would offer great potential benefit to patients with postoperative pain, a better pain relief with less opioid. Forty-one patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty were randomly allocated to four groups. One epidural morphine and one epidural saline group (PreEpiMo and PreMo, respectively) received morphine, 0.14 mg/kg i.m. Morphine premedication reduced postoperative pain in the immediate postoperative period in patients with epidural placebo (PreMo), but the effect was absent in patients with PreEpiMo. The dosage of epidural morphine used in this study was a likely explanation of this depression. In conclusion, morphine premedication had a temporary rest effect on the postoperative pain. Epidural morphine provides a better analgesia than intravenous PCA-fentanyl.</s><s>Epidural analgesia with local anaesthetic minimizes the catabolic response to surgery. Epidural analgesia with a combination of bupivacaine and fentanyl did not result in any measurable improvement in rehabilitation milestones or reduction in postoperative complications following bilateral total knee arthroplasty than with fentanyl infusions alone.</s><s>It is unclear whether epidural or systemic pain therapy is superior in terms of postoperative pain relief, patients' comfort and side effects. Main outcome measures included visual analogue pain scales, total morphine consumption, and stress hormones. No statistically significant differences in visual analogue pain scales could be detected between the three groups. Application of epidural morphine significantly suppressed beta-endorphine release, but did not significantly influence other stress hormones as compared to the control group. Epidural and intravenous analgesia after total knee arthroplasty are equivalent methods of pain relief.

Naloxone 5 micrograms kg-1 h-1 was required for hypercapnia exceeding 6.0 kPa in three patients in the extradural morphine group (vs none in the ketoprofen group; ns). ketoprofen and extradural morphine, we conclude that ketoprofen may be an efficient alternative to extradural morphine after hip and knee arthroplasty.</s><s>In this study, we assessed the influence of three analgesic techniques on postoperative knee rehabilitation after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with morphine in Group A, continuous 3-in-1 block in Group B, and epidural analgesia in Group C. Immediately after surgery, the three groups started identical physical therapy regimens. Patients in Groups B and C reported significantly lower pain scores than those in Group A. Compared with Groups A and C, a significantly lower incidence of side effects was noted in Group B. Because it induces fewer side effects, continuous 3-in-1 block should be considered the technique of choice. Implications: In this study, we determined that, after total knee arthroplasty, loco-regional analgesic techniques (epidural analgesia or continuous 3-in-1 block) provide better pain relief and faster postoperative knee rehabilitation than i.v.</s><s>The authors conducted a randomized, prospective study comparing epidural morphine with patient-controlled intravenous (iv) morphine in 30 patients recovering from total hip or total knee arthroplasty. Six, 18, and 24 hr postoperatively, patients used a 10 cm visual-analogue scale to indicate both their current degree of discomfort and the maximum discomfort they had experienced since the previous evaluation. Minimum respiratory rates were lower in patients receiving epidural morphine (15.0 +/- 0.3) than in those receiving patient-controlled analgesia (16.5 +/- 0.4, P less than 0.05), but no patients required treatment for respiratory depression.</s><s>The aim of our study was to compare epidural anesthesia and analgesia (EDA) with ropivacaine versus general anesthesia followed by IV patient-controlled analgesia with morphine (GA/PCA) after hip replacement regarding pain, side effects, and discharge from the postanesthesia care unit. After ethics committee approval, randomization, and informed consent, 90 patients were enrolled. Pain was assessed by using visual analog scales (0-100 mm) at rest and during physiotherapy.

Six weeks after angioplasty, a significant thickening of the intima/media complex in the treated vascular segment of 14.3% occurred in the placebo group versus 0% among verapamil patients (p < 0.01). The rate of restenosis was also significantly lower in the verapamil group (p < 0.001). In patients with POAD at increased risk for restenosis, the administration of high dose verapamil prevented recurrent stenosis for 6 months after successful peripheral angioplasty and was well tolerated.</s><s>The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic importance of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) as evaluated by ankle blood pressure index (ABI), and the impact of ramipril on the prevention of major cardiovascular events in PAD patients included in the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) study. Patients were randomized to treatment with ramipril or placebo and followed for 4.5 years. The ABI was subnormal (< or =0.9) in 3099 patients and normal in 5887 patients.

Three hundred sixty-one patients from 26 North American centers entered this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with acute exacerbation of chronic schizophrenia (DSM-III-R). At end point, significant differences (p < 0.05, analysis of covariance) in adjusted mean changes from baseline were identified between the four highest doses of quetiapine and placebo for BPRS total, BPRS positive-symptom cluster, and CGI Severity of Illness item scores and between quetiapine 300 mg and placebo for SANS summary score. Quetiapine is well tolerated and clinically effective in the treatment of schizophrenia.

The present study investigated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of aripiprazole and haloperidol compared with placebo. A 4-week, double-blind, randomized study, conducted at 36 U.S. centers between July 1997 and June 1998, compared aripiprazole (15 mg/day, 30 mg/day) to placebo, with haloperidol (10 mg/day) as an active control. Fixed doses of each agent were administered from day 1 throughout the study. A total of 414 patients with a primary DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were randomized. Both doses of aripiprazole and haloperidol, 10 mg, produced statistically significant (p < or = .05) improvements from baseline in PANSS total, PANSS positive, PANSS-derived BPRS core, and CGI-Severity scores and significantly lower CGI-Improvement scores at endpoint, compared with placebo.</s><s>In a double-blind study, 135 inpatients with a diagnosis of chronic schizophrenia were randomly assigned to 8 weeks of treatment with one of six parallel treatments: risperidone (a new central 5-hydroxytryptamine2 and dopamine D2 antagonist), 2, 6, 10, 16 mg/day; haloperidol, 20 mg/day; or placebo, after a single-blind placebo washout period. Doses were increased in fixed increments up to a fixed maintenance dose reached after 1 week. On the total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) score and positive subscale, superiority to placebo was observed for all treatment groups except for haloperidol and risperidone (2 mg), which tended to be superior to placebo on total PANSS and the positive subscale, respectively. By contrast, haloperidol produced significantly more parkinsonism than placebo and risperidone (2, 6 and 16 mg), with no effect on tardive dyskinesia. These data suggest that risperidone, at the optimal therapeutic dose of 6 mg/day, produced significant improvement in both positive and negative symptoms without an increase in drug-induced parkinsonian symptoms and with a significant beneficial effect on tardive dyskinesia.</s><s>Haloperidol: a controlled trial in chronic schizophrenia.</s><s>The purpose of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of risperidone in the treatment of schizophrenic patients and determine its optimal dose. This double-blind study included 388 schizophrenic patients drawn from 20 sites in the United States.

Patients were randomly assigned to the following drugs orally administered twice a day: placebo; diazepam 15 mg; imipramine 50 mg; chlorpromazine 75 mg; and haloperidol 3 mg. Since only two patients received all five drug treatments, the data were analyzed using the number of days allocated to the \"first assigned drugs\" only and the cross-over aspect of the experimental design was disregarded. At the end of the 3-year trial, both chlorpromazine and haloperidol significantly prolonged the remission state as compared to the other three drugs.

In accordance with the recommended multi-dimensional evaluation approach, three primary variables were chosen: the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI Item 2) for psychopathological assessment, the Syndrom-Kurztest (SKT) for the assessment of the patient's attention and memory, and the Nürnberger Alters-Beobachtungsskala (NAB) for behavioral assessment of activities of daily life. The intent-to-treat analysis of 205 patients led to similar efficacy results.</s><s>Sixty inpatients with cerebral insufficiency and the leading symptom depressive mood, were treated in a double-blind study for 6 weeks with a daily dose of 160 mg Ginkgo biloba extract or placebo. After 2 weeks the differences were marked for only a few of the symptoms; after 4 and 6 weeks in contrast, in 11 of the 12 symptoms. The largest number of improvements in the Ginkgo-biloba group was observed between the 2nd and 4th weeks of treatment.</s><s>Among the psychiatric illnesses associated with old age primary degenerative dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) has gained increasing importance in recent years. The primary outcome variable was the sum score in the SKT-test for the determination of attention and memory. Although the active-treatment group, with a mean sum score of 19.67 points in the, S.K.T., had a poorer baseline level than the placebo group (18.11 points), it experienced an improvement to 16.78 points under treatment with EGb 761 whereas the placebo group deteriorated to 18.89 points. Inter-group differences in the ADAS cognitive and non-cognitive subscales did not reach statistical significance, probably because of the small sample size.</s><s>Problem: The effect of ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761 on basic parameters of mental performance. Study design: Double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled study of 24 weeks duration. Results: Statistically significant improvement in the shortterm memory after 6 weeks and of the learning rate after 24 weeks in the test substance group, but not in the placebo group (longitudinal analysis).</s><s>In a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind clinical trial, 40 patients with a mean age of 68 (+/- 12.5) years suffering from moderate dementia (Alzheimer, vascular, or mixed type) according to DSM-III-R criteria were included. Severity of the disease had to correspond to stages 4 or 5 of Reisberg's Global Deterioration Scale. Primary outcome measure was the activities of daily living as assessed by the Nürnberger-Alters-Beobachtungsskala (NAB). Using a sequential testing procedure, a global significance level of p < 0.05 could be assured. Superiority of EGb 761 therapy was also found with respect to a self-rating scale for instrumental activities of daily living (Nürnberger-Alters-Alltagsaktivitätenskala), the improvement of the most prominent symptom of illness, and the decrease of depression. Thus clinical efficacy of EGb 761 could be shown on three planes of assessment: the behavioral, the psychopathologic and the psychometric plane.</s><s>A growing number of people is subject to age-related cognitive impairment due to the proportional increase of the ageing population. Patients were assessed using a psychometric testbattery in the following order: Expended Mental Control Test (EMCT) measuring attention and concentration, Benton Test of Visual Retention-Revised (measures short term visual memory), Rey Test part 1 (measures short term memory and learning curve), Beck Depressive Inventory (BDI) measuring the presence and severeness of a depression in order to exclude depressive patients and Rey Test part 2 (measures long term memory: recognition). No substantial correlation was observed between subjective perception of the severeness of memory complaints and the objective test results. No differences in the number of (gastrointestinal) side effects were observed between placebo and verum groups. Further research using both subjective and objective measurements is recommended.</s>"

        "Abstracts": "<s>The Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) previously found increased risk for dementia and no effect on mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in women treated with conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). To determine the effects of CEE alone and CEE plus MPA on incidence of probable dementia and MCI in older women. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of CEE (estrogen-alone trial) or CEE plus MPA (estrogen plus progestin trial) in community-dwelling women aged 65 to 79 years, conducted from June 1995 to July 8, 2002 (estrogen plus progestin; n = 4532), or to February 29, 2004 (estrogen-alone; n = 2947), in 39 of the 40 WHI clinical centers. In the estrogen-alone trial, 76 participants were diagnosed with MCI in the CEE group vs 58 in the placebo group (HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 0.95-1.89). In the estrogen-alone trial, 93 participants receiving CEE were diagnosed with either probable dementia or MCI vs 69 receiving placebo (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.01-1.89; P =.04). Estrogen therapy alone did not reduce dementia or MCI incidence and increased the risk for both end points combined. Use of hormone therapy to prevent dementia or cognitive decline in women 65 years of age or older is not recommended.</s><s>Postmenopausal women have a greater risk than men of developing Alzheimer disease, but studies of the effects of estrogen therapy on Alzheimer disease have been inconsistent. To evaluate the effect of estrogen plus progestin on the incidence of dementia and mild cognitive impairment compared with placebo. The mean (SD) time between the date of randomization into WHI and the last Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MSE) for all WHIMS participants was 4.05 (1.19) years. This increased risk would result in an additional 23 cases of dementia per 10 000 women per year. Alzheimer disease was the most common classification of dementia in both study groups. Treatment effects on mild cognitive impairment did not differ between groups (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.74-1.55; 63 vs 59 cases per 10 000 person-years; P =.72). Estrogen plus progestin therapy increased the risk for probable dementia in postmenopausal women aged 65 years or older. In addition, estrogen plus progestin therapy did not prevent mild cognitive impairment in these women. These findings, coupled with previously reported WHI data, support the conclusion that the risks of estrogen plus progestin outweigh the benefits.</s><s>The present randomized double blind study investigated the effects of a 2 week transdermal estradiol treatment on memory performance in 38 healthy elderly women. Cognitive performance was tested at baseline and after 2 weeks of estradiol or placebo treatment using verbal, semantic, and spatial memory tests as well as a mental rotation task and the Stroop. Initial results showed no differences after treatment between placebo or estradiol treated subjects. A nonsignificant trend was observed for the immediate recall condition (P < 0.10). The present study supports the idea that estradiol replacement has specific effects on verbal memory in healthy postmenopausal women, with delayed recall being more affected. It suggests that these effects can occur relatively rapidly, and that there may be a dose response relationship of estradiol to memory enhancement.</s><s>The effects of estrogen (E) on memory were assessed in 19 women who required a hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy for benign disease. Scores on the immediate and delayed recall of paired-associates stayed at the same level in E-treated women, whereas they decreased significantly pre- to post-operatively in the PL-treated subjects. In the immediate recall of paragraphs, the scores of those given E improved postoperatively compared to baseline; scores remained unchanged in the PL group.</s><s>The results of several observational studies suggest that the use of estrogen replacement is associated with better mood, cognitive function and quality of life. Such findings are consistent with those of laboratory-based research showing that estrogen promotes neuronal sprouting, enhances cholinergic activity in the brain, decreases brain and plasma levels of beta-amyloid, increases serotonin postsynaptic responsivity and the turnover of noradrenaline, and inhibits monoamine oxidase activity. We designed the present randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to clarify this issue. Nineteen women treated with estradiol and 10 of those treated with placebo discontinued the use of the medication during trial, most frequently due to adverse reactions (OR=4.11, 95% CI=1.29-15.37). A separate analysis restricted to women who completed the 20-week-trial produced similar negative results. The results of this trial indicate that the use of a relatively high dosage of unopposed estrogen replacement for 20 weeks is not associated with significant changes in cognitive function, mood and quality of life. Other more efficacious and safer interventions need to be devised with the aim of improving the mental state and quality of life of older women.</s><s>Several small trials and many observational studies suggest that estrogen treatment in postmenopausal women improves cognition, but 2 large randomized trials have shown harm. The effect of an ultra-low- dose of unopposed transdermal estradiol on cognition and health-related quality of life is unknown. To investigate the effect of unopposed ultra-low-dose transdermal estradiol on cognitive function and quality of life in postmenopausal women. Changes in cognitive function and quality of life were preplanned secondary outcomes of the trial. A weekly transdermal patch that delivers estradiol, 0.014 mg/d (n = 208), or placebo (n = 209). The 36-Item Short-Form General Health Survey was administered to assess health-related quality of life in physical and mental domains. At 2 years of follow-up, we found no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in change on any of the cognitive test scores or on the 36-Item Short-Form General Health Survey (P > .12 for all).</s><s>Estrogen treatment of postmenopausal women has been suggested to improve mood and psychological function. Memory was assessed directly by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scales, measuring both digit span and digit symbol. The income management scale of the Profile of Adaptation to Life improved (P less than .05) with estrogen, as did the Beck Depression Inventory (P less than .05), but these results were not dose-related. These results suggest that estrogen use may improve the overall quality of life in postmenopausal women.</s><s>To determine the effects of 9 months of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on cognitive performance in women aged 75 years and older. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:2 ratio to placebo or conjugated estrogens at 0.625 mg/d plus trimonthly medroxyprogesterone acetate at 5 mg/d for 13 days (HRT). At baseline, women in the HRT group reported a younger age of onset of menopause and a higher prevalence of hysterectomy, but otherwise did not differ from women in the placebo group. After 9 months of treatment, there were no significant group differences for any of the cognitive performance measures.</s><s>The influence of a combined estrogen-progestin regimen (Climodien) on noopsyche, thymopsyche, personality and psychophysiological measures of menopausal syndrome patients was investigated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, comparative, randomized 3-arm trial phase (Climodien 2/3 = estradiol valerate (CAS 979-32-8) 2 mg + the progestin dienogest (CAS 65928-58-7) 3 mg = regimen A, estradiol valerate 2 mg = regimen EV, and placebo = regimen P) followed by an open-label phase in which all patients received Climodien 2/2 (estradiol valerate 2 mg + dienogest 2 mg) = regimen A*. These findings suggest that hormone replacement therapy with estradiol, and even more in combination with dienogest, improves verbal and visual memory, which is in line with the improvement in information processing speed and capacity objectified by event-related potentials (ERP). Thymopsychic investigations demonstrated a significant improvement in somatic complaints and trait anxiety after both regimen A and regimen EV as compared with baseline. The Freiburger Personality Inventory showed an improvement in aggressivity after regimen A* as compared with the preceding placebo as well as an improvement in striving after dominancy after both regimen A and regimen EV as compared with pre-treatment, but also after regimen A* as compared with regimen EV.</s><s>Our aim was to determine the effect of hormone replacement on physical performance measures, functional ability, physical activity, falls, and cognitive function in elderly women. We assessed time to rise from a chair, timed walking, balance, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, Physical Activity Scale of the Elderly, Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination, and falls. Over 3 years, except for balance scores, performance measures declined significantly (all P<.05). There were no significant mean differences between the two groups for the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (0.1, -0.1 to 0.3 points), Physical Activity Scale of the Elderly (-3, -15 to 8 points), Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination (-0.1, -0.3 to 0.3 points), or the proportion of participants reporting falls (-1, -11 to 9%).</s><s>Some studies of hormone treatment in postmenopausal women suggest benefits on specific cognitive functions, particularly memory. The objective of this study was to determine whether hormone therapy influences changes in specific cognitive functions and affect in older women. This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Intervention was conjugated equine estrogen (CEE; 0.625 mg) with 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) in one daily tablet (CEE + MPA) or placebo. CEE + MPA had a negative impact on verbal memory (P <or= 0.01) and a trend to a positive impact on figural memory (P = 0.012) over time compared with placebo, but other cognitive domains were not affected. Our results extend prior findings about dementia and global cognitive function to age-related changes in specific cognitive functions and suggest directions for future research.</s><s>Estrogen concentrations decline with age and menopause is often followed by an acceleration of the age effects on cognition. Effects of estrogens on memory have been reported in studies with women in a clinical setting who either needed or wished to have the estrogen replacement and are mostly in the perimenopausal age-band. The present study investigated the effects of estradiol on memory and on frontal lobe function in elderly female subjects who did not suffer any of the postmenopausal symptoms and had never taken estrogen hormone replacement (EHR) previously. Memory, frontal lobe functions (inhibition and planning) and visuospatial abilities (mental rotation) were tested before and after treatment. Cortisol plasma levels were also measured before and after cognitive performance in order to evaluate the effects of EHR on the sensitivity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis to mild mental stress. Plasma estradiol levels in the drug group increased to levels equivalent to that of a fertile woman (0.21+/-0.5 nmol/l).</s><s>The question of whether estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) is beneficial to cognitive functioning in postmenopausal women has become controversial in the past several years. The present study used a randomized, placebo-controlled design and a transdermal estrogen preparation composed of 17-beta estradiol. Baseline to follow-up change was analyzed using multiple regression techniques. These results suggest that reproductive events and levels of endogenous estrogen are related to the clinical response to ERT, but larger studies with longer follow-up periods are needed to determine the strength of these effects.</s><s>To evaluate the effect of estrogen replacement therapy on cognitive functioning. The study consisted of two 3-month treatment periods, one with estrogen and one with the placebo, in random order, separated by a 1-month wash-out period. Most of the cognitive tests correlated with age: older women were slower and made more errors than younger women. On the most demanding test of working memory, the reaction times (P = .045) and error rates (P = .043) differed between treatments, yet this finding proved to be an effect of learning rather than treatment. Short-term estrogen replacement therapy did not provide any advantage over the placebo in terms of improving the performance.</s><s>In the last ten years, numerous mechanisms by which sex steroids modify cortical function have been described. Little is known about sex steroid effects on other aspects of memory, such as frontal lobe-mediated working memory. Testosterone supplementation improved working memory in older men, but a similar enhancement of working memory was not found in older women supplemented with estrogen. These results suggest that sex steroids can modulate working memory in men and can act as modulators of cognition throughout life.</s><s>Postural instability and falls in the elderly patient constitute a major health care problem. It was, therefore, postulated that estrogen replacement may improve central processing speed, which would result in improved postural stability. Trail Making B test was used as the psychometric test of central processing speed. It is concluded that 8 months of estrogen replacement therapy has no significant effect on central processing speed or postural stability in a healthy older female population.</s><s>Preclinical studies suggest that estrogen affects neural structure and function in mature animals; clinical studies are less conclusive with many, but not all, studies showing a positive influence of estrogen on verbal memory in postmenopausal women. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial from 1996 through 1998. Forty-six postmenopausal women aged 33 to 61 years (mean [SD] age, 50.8 [4.7] years). Brain activation patterns measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging during tasks involving verbal and nonverbal working memory. Treatment with estrogen increased activation in the inferior parietal lobule during storage of verbal material and decreased activation in the inferior parietal lobule during storage of nonverbal material. Estrogen did not affect actual performance of the verbal and nonverbal memory tasks. Estrogen in a therapeutic dosage alters brain activation patterns in postmenopausal women in specific brain regions during the performance of the sorts of memory function that are called upon frequently during any given day.</s>"

Twenty-four infants, 4.6 +/- 0.5 (mean +/- SEM) months of age, with their first episode of bronchiolitis were tested. After sedation with chloral hydrate, a clinical score and pulmonary mechanics measurements using simultaneous signals of airflow volume and transpulmonary pressure were recorded. Thirty minutes later, there was a significant decrease in clinical score after treatment with racemic epinephrine compared with the baseline score (p < 0.001); this difference was not present after salbutamol inhalation (p = 0.42). Only 13 patients had a decrease in clinical score after salbutamol therapy, in comparison with 20 infants treated with racemic epinephrine (p < 0.01). We conclude that racemic epinephrine is superior to salbutamol in the treatment of infants with their first episode of acute bronchiolitis.</s><s>In previously well infants hospitalized with acute viral bronchiolitis, the effectiveness of repeated nebulized therapy with epinephrine (EPI) was compared with treatment with albuterol (ALB) or saline placebo (PLAC). There were no group differences in the primary outcome measure, mean LOS (hours)(+/- SD): EPI = 59.8 (62), ALB = 61.4 (54), and PLAC = 63.3 (47); P =.95 by intent-to-treat analysis. Group differences were not statistically significant in any of the secondary outcomes. There were no group differences in the effectiveness of therapy for infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis.</s><s>Although it is the most common lower respiratory infection of infancy, the optimal treatment for acute bronchiolitis is still controversial. The aim of this study was to compare the early and late effects of nebulized L-epinephrine (EPI) and intramuscular dexamethasone (DEX) combination therapy with nebulized salbutamol (SAL) and dexamethasone combination and bronchodilators alone in outpatients with acute bronchiolitis. The study groups were: epinephrine + dexamethasone group (group 1, n=23), salbutamol + dexamethasone group (group 2, n=23), epinephrine + placebo group (group 3, n=11), and salbutamol + placebo group (group 4, n=12). There were no significant differences between the outcome variables of the four groups within the first 120 min and at 24 hours, or between the rates of requirement of a second dose of the same bronchodilator. However, fifth day RDAI score values of both DEX groups were significantly lower than that of SAL + PLA group (P=0.000 and P=0.01, respectively). The fifth day score value of group 1 was also significantly better than that value of EPI + PLA group but not different from group 2. However, effects of EPI + DEX combination was not different from SAL + DEX combination.</s><s>Although numerous studies have explored the benefit of using nebulized epinephrine or corticosteroids alone to treat infants with bronchiolitis, the effectiveness of combining these medications is not well established. We conducted a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which 800 infants (6 weeks to 12 months of age) with bronchiolitis who were seen in the pediatric emergency department were randomly assigned to one of four study groups. The primary outcome was hospital admission within 7 days after the day of enrollment (the initial visit to the emergency department). In the unadjusted analysis, only the infants in the epinephrine-dexamethasone group were significantly less likely than those in the placebo group to be admitted by day 7 (relative risk, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.45 to 0.95, P=0.02). However, with adjustment for multiple comparisons, this result was rendered insignificant (P=0.07).</s><s>To determine if nebulized epinephrine is more efficacious than nebulized albuterol in the emergency department (ED) treatment of moderately ill infants with bronchiolitis. Secondary outcome measures were room air oxygen saturation, elapsed time to meeting clinical criteria for ED discharge, hospitalization rate, and proportion of patients relapsed within 72 hours of ED discharge (relapse rate). There were no significant differences between the groups by these same measures at any time. Sixteen infants (47.1%) in the epinephrine-treated group were hospitalized compared with 12 infants (37.5%) in the albuterol-treated group (relative risk, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 0.71-2.22).</s><s>Our objective was to determine if nebulized racemic epinephrine is more efficacious than nebulized albuterol or saline placebo in the treatment of bronchiolitis in the outpatient setting when dosing is equivalent in terms of beta-2 agonist potency.

There were no significant statistical differences between groups in terms of need for hospital admission or outpatient management with home oxygen therapy.</s><s>The objective of this study was to investigate the effectivenesses of nebulized salbutamol, epinephrin, 3% saline, and normal saline (0.9% NaCl) in the treatment of mildly affected infants with acute bronchiolitis. We enrolled 186 children (mean age 9.5 +/- 5.3 months, range 1.5-24 months, 65.1% male) with a first episode of wheezing diagnosed as mild bronchiolitis in emergency department. After discharge, patients were reassessed by telephone contact at 48 hr and 6 months. There were no significant differences between the outcome variables of the groups (P > 0.05).</s><s>This randomized, double-blind trial compared the efficacy of nebulized epinephrine with salbutamol in the treatment of infants with acute bronchiolitis. Thirty-three percent of the patients in epinephrine group were admitted to the hospital compared with 81% of the salbutamol group (p = 0.003).</s><s>As the efficacy of combined nebulized salbutamol & ipratropium bromide as well as L-adrenaline to treat acute bronchiolitis is not well studied among the Bangladeshi infants, this study was carried out to see their efficacy in acute bronchiolitis and to compare their effectiveness. After a quick initial assessment, nebulization were done twice at 6 hours interval with the mentioned drugs, group wise (one group with salbutamol plus ipratropium bromide and other group with L-adrenaline alone) and the outcomes were assessed after 30 minutes of each nebulization in respect to oxygen saturation and clinical modified respiratory distress assessment instrument (MRDAI) scores. The results were analyzed by using SPSS version 10.0 and at a p value of </=0.05, the test was considered significant.

Observations were made at admission and just before, 30 minutes after, and 60 minutes after each dose. The primary outcome measures were the length of the hospital stay and the time until the infant was ready for discharge. The secondary outcome measures were the degree of change in the respiratory rate, the heart rate, and the respiratory-effort score and the time that supplemental oxygen was required. The heart rate was significantly increased after each treatment with epinephrine (P=0.02 to P<0.001).

After a median follow-up of 5.8 years (range, 3 to 8.4 years), 188 DFS events had occurred (DI-EC, 86 events; SD-CT, 102 events). The 5-year DFS was 52% for DI-EC and 43% for SD-CT, with hazard ratio of DI-EC compared with SD-CT of 0.77 (95% CI, 0.58 to 1.02; P = .07). A larger trial or meta-analysis will be required to reveal the true effect of dose-intensive therapy.</s><s>The purpose of this study was to assess whether a short course of anthracycline containing chemotherapy followed by high dose therapy with autologous stem-cell support improves disease-free and overall survival as compared with conventional, anthracycline containing chemotherapy, in patients with primary breast cancer and four or more histologically involved lymph nodes. To be eligible, patients had to be free of overt metastatic disease and be < or =60 years of age. At a median follow up of 68 months, 118 patients have experienced a relapse or death from breast cancer (62 in the FEC followed by HDT arm and 56 in the conventional FEC arm) and a total of 100 patients have died (54 in the FEC followed by HDT arm and 46 in the conventional FEC arm). No significant difference was observed in relapse-free survival [hazard ratio 1.06, 95% CI 0.74-1.52, p = 0.76] or overall survival [hazard ratio 1.18, 95% CI 0.80-1.75, p = 0.40]. At the present time, no benefit has been observed from replacing three cycles of conventional chemotherapy with the HDT regimen described here.</s><s>The prognosis for patients with primary breast cancer involving multiple axillary lymph nodes is poor. In nonrandomized studies, the use of high-dose chemotherapy as consolidation therapy after standard-dose induction chemotherapy has resulted in an apparent improvement in disease-free survival rates to over 70%. Arms A and B are identical in the use of four cycles of conventional therapy with cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin and fluorouracil, radiation therapy, and tamoxifen. Arm B, with its less dose-intensive therapy, requires considerably less support to apply the treatment. Because of the high cost of this therapy and the requirement for technology-intensive support, there has been considerable interest in economic outcome assessments.</s><s>The prognosis for women with primary breast cancer and 10 or more involved axillary lymph nodes is poor. Among 417 patients fulfilling strict eligibility criteria, the time to recurrence was longer for patients who underwent stem-cell transplantation than for those who received CAF alone. In the transplantation group, nine patients died of transplantation-related complications and a myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia developed in nine. The addition of high-dose chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation to six cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with CAF may reduce the risk of relapse but does not improve the outcome among patients with primary breast cancer and at least 10 involved axillary lymph nodes.</s><s>Breast cancer with extensive axillary-lymph-node involvement has a poor prognosis after conventional treatment. In trials with historical controls, high-dose chemotherapy produced improved outcomes. Patients with at least nine positive nodes were randomly assigned either two courses of accelerated (2-week intervals, with filgrastim support), conventionally dosed epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by two courses of high-dose chemotherapy (epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, and thiotepa supported by peripheral-blood progenitors) or four identical cycles of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by three cycles of accelerated cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil. 403 patients were enrolled; 201 were assigned high-dose chemotherapy and 202 conventional treatment. The mean number of positive nodes was 17.6, and median follow-up was 48.6 months. Our finding of significant improvements in both event-free and overall survival for high-dose chemotherapy compared with a dose-dense conventional regimen contrasts with the results of other studies.</s><s>Uncontrolled studies have reported encouraging outcomes for patients with high-risk primary breast cancer treated with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic stem cell support.

Seventy-eight patients (48 after primary surgery and 30 after primary chemotherapy) were registered. In intention-to-treat analyses, estimated 3-year relapse-free survival rates were 62% and 48% for FAC and FAC/high-dose chemotherapy, respectively (P =.35), and 3-year survival rates were 77% and 58%, respectively (P =.23).</s><s>Uncontrolled studies suggest that high-dose chemotherapy is beneficial in patients with breast cancer and multiple metastases to the axillary lymph nodes. This high-dose regimen comprised cyclophosphamide 6 g/m2, thiotepa 480 mg/m2, and carboplatin 1600 mg/m2. With a median follow-up of 49 (range 21-76) months, the 4-year overall and relapse-free survivals for all 97 patients were 75% and 54%, respectively. There was no significant difference in survival between the patients on conventional therapy and those on high-dose therapy. High-dose therapy is associated with substantial cost and acute toxic effects, but also has potentially irreversible long-term effects. Until the benefit of this therapy is substantiated by large-scale phase III trials, high-dose chemotherapy should not be used in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer, apart from in randomised studies.</s><s>Early studies of high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) for breast cancer were limited by small numbers and the lack of adequate control groups. The French PEGASE Group was founded to perform larger and properly randomized comparative studies of this approach. The seven PEGASE protocols addressed HDC as adjuvant therapy (01 and 06) and as treatment for inflammatory nonmetastatic disease (02, 05, and 07) and metastatic disease (03 and 04). The PEGASE 01 adjuvant therapy trial showed that 3-year disease-free survival was significantly better in the HDC arm but overall survival was unchanged.

Wet and dry weight of sputum were recorded during the 50-minute sessions and 30 minutes afterward. For each treatment a score was given by the patient for efficacy, and by both the patient and the physiotherapist for tolerance. Wet and dry weights of sputum collected during the sessions were greater for all CPT regimens than for CONT (P < 0.001, P < 0.0001).</s><s>The effect of positive expiratory pressure breathing, alone and in combination with coughing, was investigated in eight patients with cystic fibrosis. Functional residual capacity and total lung capacity was measured with a body plethysmograph before, during, and immediately after breathing with expiratory pressure of 5 and 15 cm H2O, and after a coughing period. The positive expiratory pressure breathing was carried out five times for two minutes with a two minute interval between each period. Clearance measurements were carried out continuously during positive expiratory pressure breathing and during a control period. Two minutes' breathing with an expiratory pressure of 5 and 15 cm H2O caused an increase in mean (SEM) functional residual capacity from 2.6 (0.1) to 3.6 (0.3) and 4.4 (0.5) 1 and an increase in total lung capacity from 5.1 (0.2) to 5.9 (0.3) and 6.9 (0.4) 1.</s><s>The use of a positive expiratory pressure (PEP) mask was compared with postural drainage in the treatment of 10 patients with cystic fibrosis. The patients were allocated randomly in a crossover fashion to the two regimens and evaluated initially by a physiotherapist and over a 4 week treatment period by use of a diary card.</s><s>We studied the acute effects of 4 different chest physical therapy regimens using a randomised cross-over design in 14 patients with cystic fibrosis. Treatment A consisted of postural drainage, percussion and vibration; treatment B of postural drainage and periodic application of a face mask with positive expiratory pressure (PEP); treatment C of PEP in the sitting position; treatment D of the forced expiration technique in the sitting position. Skin oxygen tension, PSO2 was monitored continuously during and for 35 min after treatment. A substantial and prolonged decay in PSO2 was observed during treatment A, quite different from other patterns seen.</s><s>Individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) have large amounts of infected mucus in their lungs, which causes irreversible lung tissue damage. Although patient-administered positive expiratory pressure (PEP) breathing has been promoted as an effective therapeutic modality for removing mucus and improving ventilation distribution in these patients, the effects of PEP on ventilation distribution and gas mixing have not been documented. Single-breath inert gas studies and lung function tests were performed before, immediately after, and 45 minutes after intervention. By 45 minutes after intervention, the no-PEP group improved by 5%, the low-PEP group improved by 15%, and the high-PEP group improved by 23%. Residual volume decreased by 13% after no PEP, by 20% after low PEP, and by 30% after high PEP. This study demonstrated the physiologic basis for the efficacy of PEP therapy. The authors propose that improvements in gas mixing may lead to increases in oxygenation and thus functional exercise capacity.</s><s>We report the results of a long-term comparative trial of physiotherapy by the positive expiratory pressure (PEP) technique with a PEP mask (Astra Meditec) versus conventional postural drainage and percussion (PD&P). Group A (control) continued to perform physiotherapy by using PD&P for a 1-year period, whereas patients assigned to group B performed physiotherapy with the PEP technique for the same period. Clinical status and pulmonary function (forced vital capacity [FVC], FEV1, and FEF25-75) were measured at 3-month intervals. This improvement was significantly different from that of group A (PD&P) whose pulmonary function declined in all parameters (FVC, -2.17; FEV1, -2.28; FEF25-75, -0.24). The differences between treatment groups were statistically significant for the changes in FVC (p = 0.02) and FEV(1) (p = 0.04). Our results indicate that for our patients with cystic fibrosis, pulmonary physiotherapy with the PEP technique was superior to conventional physiotherapy with the PD&P technique.</s><s>The effects of three different regimes of chest physiotherapy were compared in this cross-over study. Mucus clearance was monitored in nine clinically stable cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. The patients performed: 1) postural drainage with thoracic expansion exercises + forced expiration technique (FET) in the left decubitus position; 2) positive expiratory pressure (PEP)-mask breathing + FET; and 3) physical exercise on a bicycle ergometer + FET. Surprisingly, postural drainage (PD) was the most effective technique in the left, dependent lung in 7 of the 9 patients.</s><s>Previous studies have shown that the Scandipharm Flutter airway clearance device has increased the ability of cystic fibrosis patients to expectorate mucus. The long-term effect of the Flutter on pulmonary function tests (PFTs) was studied and compared with other airway clearance techniques, such as chest physiotherapy (CPT) and Vital Signs, Inc. 9000 PEP positive expiratory pressure (PEP) therapy for cystic fibrosis patients of five to 17 years of age with mild to moderate disease. The patients stated they felt better clinically, were able to expectorate mucus more easily, and felt more in control of their therapies. This study has shown no significant change in respiratory assessment parameters or pulmonary function. Further studies involving multicenter trials are warranted to evaluate the effects of the Flutter on pulmonary function.</s><s>Recently, the flutter was introduced as a new device to improve sputum expectoration. Lung function parameters (peak expiratory flow, forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second, maximal midexpiratory flow, maximal expiratory flow at 25% of FVC, thoracic gas volume, total lung capacity, residual volume/total lung capacity, airway resistance and specific airway conductance) and changes in transcutaneous oxygen haemoglobin saturation were assessed before and after the first supervised session and at the end of each treatment period. No significant changes in any lung function parameter occurred after a single session or after 2 weeks of physiotherapy with either method. In conclusion, any superiority of the flutter over the positive expiratory pressure mask technique for expectoration could not be confirmed during 2 weeks of daily treatment in children with cystic fibrosis.</s><s>Fourteen patients with cystic fibrosis were trained in 2 self-administered chest physiotherapy (PT) techniques: high-pressure PEP-mask physiotherapy (PEP), and autogenic drainage (AD). They then visited the clinic on 5 consecutive days, and, in a random order, performed 1 of the following: PEP, AD, PEP followed by AD (PEP-AD), AD followed by PEP (AD-PEP), and, no PT except for spontaneous coughing. Lung function was measured repeatedly before, during, and after PT; time needed for and sputum produced by each form of PT was recorded. Lung function improved significantly after PEP, AD, and PEP-AD, but PEP-induced changes did not exceed those after AD. Within the investigated group, the PEP-induced lung function improvement per milliliter of sputum produced was significantly lower for those patients with airway hyperreactivity.</s><s>The objective was to evaluate the long-term effects of physiotherapy with an oscillating positive pressure device (\"flutter\") compared with physiotherapy with the use of a positive expiratory pressure (PEP) mask in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Study design: Forty children with CF were randomly assigned to performing physiotherapy with the PEP mask or the flutter device for 1 year. Clinical status, pulmonary function, and compliance were measured at regular intervals throughout the study.</s><s>The use of the 'PEP' mask with forced expiratory coughing was compared with conventional physiotherapy over a one month period. No difference was shown in symptom scores, sputum production, or simple lung function tests.</s><s>It has been suggested that positive expiratory pressure may assist the clearance of bronchial secretions in the treatment of cystic fibrosis. Treatment A consisted of breathing exercises emphasising inspiration, interspersed with the forced expiration technique in gravity assisted positions; treatment B comprised breathing exercises with positive expiratory pressure alternating with the forced expiration technique in the same gravity assisted positions; and treatment C comprised breathing exercises with positive expiratory pressure and the forced expiration technique in the sitting position. During treatment A a significantly greater quantity of sputum was produced than during treatments B and C (p less than 0.025 and p less than 0.001 respectively).</s><s>We studied the effects of two chest physiotherapy regimens on whole lung and regional tracheobronchial clearance (TBC) in ten patients with cystic fibrosis. Each day, the clearance of lung radioactivity was measured for 3 h by gamma camera. The number of spontaneous coughs was recorded and the sputum expectorated was sampled. Evaluation of TBC during chest physiotherapy when only based on the weight of sputum expectorated seems inadequate.</s><s>Twenty-eight patients suffering from cystic fibrosis, with an age range of 8-21 years entered a randomised cross-over trial to study the efficacy of the Positive Expiratory Pressure (PEP) mask as a method of chest physiotherapy, both on its own and in conjunction with other physiotherapy techniques. Five of these patients went on to a fifth programme of Forced Expiratory Technique (FET) alone. Twenty-three patients chose to continue using the PEP mask in conjunction with FET long-term as their chest physiotherapy programme as they felt it was an effective treatment allowing increased independence, with postural drainage being kept to a minimum.</s>"

        "Abstracts": "<s>In view of some controversies still existing about the real efficacy of ergot derivatives in the management of dementia, a double-blind, randomized, parallel group trial extending up to 6 months was carried out to compare the effects of nicergoline, 60 mg daily, and placebo in 315 patients suffering from mild to moderate dementia. The trial, which included a 1-month placebo run-in period, showed that both placebo and nicergoline were associated with some degree of improvement. The effect of nicergoline, however, was significantly greater and more sustained, steadily increasing with time. A comparison of nicergoline versus placebo in the frequencies of changes in each item of the SCAG showed also a significant difference at 6 months, the percent of patients displaying an improvement by at least 2 points ranging from 13.5 (bothersome) to 30.2 (disorientation) in nicergoline group, against 4.1 (self-care) to 14.3 (fatigue) in placebo group.</s><s>In this pilot study, 72 non-demented and non-depressive elderly hypertensive patients with evidence of leukoaraiosis on cerebral computed tomography scan (Rezek score: > 16) were randomly assigned to receive either nicergoline 30 mg b.i.d.

At baseline, the two groups were comparable for all demographic and clinical characteristics, including cognitive functions, except for the delayed recall of the Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT), which was better in the placebo group (P = 0.04). d. administered over a 24-month period attenuates the deterioration in cognitive functions in elderly hypertensive patients with leukoaraiosis.</s><s>A 6-month double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial preceded by a 3-week single-blind, washout/run-in placebo phase was performed in male and female patients, 55-85 years of age with a clinical diagnosis of mild to moderate multi-infarct dementia according to DSM-III to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of nicergoline 30 mg b.i.d. Primary endpoints for efficacy were the changes in the Sandoz Clinical Assessment Geriatric Scale (SCAG) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores at the end of the treatment with respect to baseline. Fifteen patients were excluded from the efficacy analyses of valid cases (VC) due to protocol violations or because they dropped out of the study prematurely. Subsequent descriptive efficacy analysis resulted in significant differences in favor of nicergoline, in the majority of cases as early as 2 months after start of treatment. Nicergoline was well tolerated and a similar number of adverse events were observed in both the placebo and the nicergoline group.</s><s>[Effect of nicergoline on the intellectual performance (author's transl)].</s><s>In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study on the therapeutic efficacy and central effects of nicergoline, an ergot alkaloid with metabolic, antithrombotic and vasoactive action, 112 patients with mild to moderate dementia, diagnosed according to DSM III-R criteria (MMS 13-25), living in pensioners' homes, were included. Fifty-six were subdiagnosed as senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT), 56 as multiinfarct dementia (MID), based on computed tomography and Hachinski scores (< or = 49 SDAT, > or = 7 MID). SDAT/PLAC, MID/NIC, MID/PLAC; 4 x 28 patients) were comparable in regard to age and sex. Only four, four, four and two patients of the respective groups did not finish the study for minor reasons. Furthermore, there was a significant improvement of the Mini-Mental State and the SCAG score in both the MID and SDAT group after 8 weeks of nicergoline, which was significantly superior to the minimal improvement or no change in placebo-treated SDAT and MID patients. The differences between PLAC and NIC reached the level of statistical significance. Thus, nicergoline improved vigilance and information processing at the neurophysiological level, which leads at the behavioural level to clinical improvement both in degenerative and vascular dementia.</s>"

Infants were randomized to either nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) at 6 cm H(2)O or nSIMV after extubation. Continuous recording for diagnosis of apnea was performed for 72 hours after extubation. Objective criteria for failure of extubation were as follows: a PaCO(2) >70; FIO(2) >0.7; or severe recurrent apnea (>2 apneas requiring intermittent positive-pressure ventilation in 24 hours or >6 apneas >20 seconds per day). The nSIMV group had a lower incidence of failed extubation 4/27 compared with the continuous positive airway pressure group, 12/27. This was attributable to both a decreased incidence of apnea and a decreased incidence of hypercarbia. There was no increase in the incidence of abdominal distension or feeding intolerance. nSIMV is effective in preventing extubation failure in very low birth weight infants in the first 72 hours after extubation.</s><s>To prospectively compare the incidence of respiratory failure in premature infants randomized to receive either nasopharyngeal continuous positive airway pressure (NPCPAP) or nasopharyngeal-synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (NP-SIMV) in the immediate postextubation period. This is a prospective study of very low birth weight (VLBW) infants randomized at the time of extubation to receive either NPCPAP or NP-SIMV in a university-based level III neonatal intensive care unit.

Outpatients with untreated CTS were consecutively recruited from our electrodiagnostics lab. Symptoms and functional deficits were measured by Levine's self-administered questionnaire, and physiologic impairment was measured by median nerve sensory and motor distal latency. COMPLIANCE AND CROSSOVER: Almost all (92%) of the combined sample reported frequent splint use, but their adherence to specific wearing instructions was limited. Despite this tendency for treatment crossover, the two treatment groups differed in daytime wear as intended (chi2 analysis, p = .004). The combined sample improved in three of four outcome measures: sensory distal latency (mean = .28msec, standard deviation [SD] = .37, p = .004), symptom severity (mean = .64, SD = .46, p = .0001), and functional deficits (mean = .49, SD = .51, p = .0001). Severity of CTS was a factor only in sensory distal latency improvement (more improvement in severe CTS).</s><s>Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common of the compression neuropathies. The results indicate that the neutral angle provided superior symptom relief, and that the relief did not often improve between 2 weeks and 2 months of wear.

When results were limited to the third month of each active-agent treatment phase, 75% (24/ 32) of patients receiving divalproex and 78% (25/32) of those receiving propranolol had reduction in migraine frequency.</s><s>This was a phase-IV double-blind equivalence trial designed to assess the efficacy and tolerability of two doses of flunarizine (10 mg o.d.=FLU 10 mg and 5 mg o.d.=FLU 5 mg) in the prophylaxis of migraine, in comparison with slow-release propranolol (160 mg o.d.). 142 subjects discontinued the trial prematurely, mainly because of adverse events (n=58). The mean attack frequency in the last 28 days of the double-blind period was 1.8 for FLU 5 mg, 1.6 for FLU 10 mg, and 1.7 for propranolol. The percentage of responders (defined as subjects for whom attack frequency decreased by at least 50% compared to run-in) in the last 28 days of the double-blind period was 46% (118/259) for FLU 5 mg, 53% (141/264) for FLU 10 mg, and 48% (125/258) for propranolol. Statistical analysis showed that FLU 10 mg is at least as effective as propranolol (P<0.001) and showed a trend for noninferiority of FLU5 and propranolol (P=0.053). No statistically significant differences between the treatment groups were found for any of the secondary parameters.</s><s>Propranolol for migraine prophylaxis.</s><s>We evaluated whether type of response to the migraine-induction test with a nitroglycerin ointment applied to the frontotemporal head region could predict the efficacy of antimigraine therapy.

Sixteen patients received nadolol, 80 mg/day; 16 received nadolol, 160 mg/day; and 16 received propranolol, 160 mg/day. The frequency and severity of headaches in the three groups were tabulated at the end of period B, as were the side effects.</s><s>The calcium-entry blocker flunarizine (Sibelium; Janssen) was compared with the beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking agent propranolol in the prophylaxis of migraine. Fifty-eight patients were entered into a double-blind 4-month treatment trial. At the end of the trial 28 patients had received 10 mg flunarizine at night during the study, 29 patients had received 60 mg propranolol 3 times a day and 1 patient was withdrawn. Both groups responded well; and there was a 4-fold drop in frequency of attacks.</s><s>The prophylactic effect of the 5-HT uptake inhibitor femoxetine was compared with propranolol (Frekven R) in a double-blind crossover trial of 6 months duration. Twelve patients withdrew because of drug failure or failure to attend checkups (6), side effects (4) or other non-drug related causes (2). In the 37 patients who completed the trial there was no significant difference between propranolol 160 mg and femoxetine 400 mg with respect to the number of headache days or the number of migraine attacks during the last 2 months of each treatment, Propranolol, however, was superior to femoxetine when the headache index was used (P less than 0.05).</s><s>The efficacy of 5-hydroxytryptophan and propranolol has been studied in the interval treatment of migraine. The treatment with both substances resulted in a statistically significant reduction in frequency of migraine attacks. Although propranolol, which is considered a reference for the interval treatment of migraine, is more effective, 5-hydroxytryptophan is a possible alternative for many patients.</s><s>Common migraine sufferers (25 males, 71 females) with a history of 2-6 attacks per month participated in a 4-centre trial comparing the prophylactic effect of timolol (10 mg b.i.d.) After a pretreatment period of 4 weeks they entered a double-blind 3-way cross-over trial with 3 treatment periods of 12 weeks each. Mean severity of attacks (0-3) was 1.75 on timolol, 1.83 on propranolol, and 1.93 on placebo. The difference between propranolol and timolol was non-significant: frequency of attacks 0.34 (95% confidence limits - 0.26; 0.89).</s><s>This study was designed to compare flunarizine, a cerebro-specific calcium channel antagonist, and propranolol in the prophylaxis of migraine with or without aura. Overall, 67% of flunarizine patients and 51% of propranolol patients responded positively. Propranolol significantly reduced blood pressure and heart rate; flunarizine had no effect on cardiovascular function. Flunarizine is at least as effective as propranolol in the prophylactic treatment of migraine and may have a better safety profile.</s><s>The clinical efficacy of flunarizine and of propranolol for the prevention of migraine attacks was assessed in a multicenter double-blind study lasting four months which was preceded by a single-blind placebo period of one month. For both drugs, more than half of the patients judged the effect to be good or very good. Propranolol furthermore significantly reduced the severity of attacks and the number of analgesics used during the attacks.</s><s>In the course of a 16 weeks' interval treatment of migraine in connection with two multicenter double-blind studies, flunarizine was compared with propranolol in patients suffering predominantly from \"classical migraine\". Eighty-seven patients from 12 outpatient departments were admitted to the first study, while 434 patients from 99 medical practices participated in the second study.

The two groups are compared in a parallel manner over a treatment period of 12 weeks, following a 4-week placebo run-in period. Fifty-five of the 74 patients who entered the trial were included at the end of the run-in period. LA.P was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing the frequency of migraine attacks (p = 0.01 by variance analysis).</s><s>The present study used recordings of visual potentials evoked by pattern reversal (VEPs) to investigate the central effects of three drugs used in migraine prophylaxis: the calcium channel blocker nifedipine, the beta-1-selective blocker metoprolol, and the nonselective beta adrenoreceptor blocker propranolol. Patients were separated by statistical analysis into responders and nonresponders to each prophylactic treatment. In contrast, the use of beta blockers resulted in a significant decrease in VEP amplitude, both in responders and nonresponders, whereas VEP latency remained unchanged. VEP amplitudes returned to the initial values at follow-up in the nonresponders, but stayed at lower levels in responders.</s><s>Propranolol penetrates the blood brain barrier, whereas mainly the racemic form, Inderal, possesses beta-receptor blocking properties. The effects of propranolol in racemic form (Inderal) 40 mg q.i.d., d-propranolol 40 mg q.i.d. The results indicate that beta-receptor blocking properties, but possibly also properties other than the beta-blocking ones, may be of importance for the anti-migraine effect of propranolol.</s><s>Prophylaxis of migraine and mixed headache. A randomized controlled study.</s><s>Nadolol and propranolol in migraine management.</s><s>A double-blind, crossover study was carried out to compare the efficacy of alpha-dihydroergocryptine mesylate (10 mg twice daily) vs propranolol (40 mg twice daily) in the prophylaxis of migraine without aura, and to identify possible predictors of therapeutic response by evaluating the symptomatological profile of individual migraine attacks and the autonomic cardiovascular response to noradrenergic and dopaminergic (cold pressor, bromocriptine) tests. Both drugs showed a significant reduction in all the efficacy variables (headache attacks, days with headache, analgesic consumption) with no difference between treatments. Neither a bromocriptine test, nor a cold pressor test nor the symptomatological profile of individual migraine attacks differed between the two groups of migraine patients. Ten patients experienced at least one adverse drug reaction during the first period of the crossover design, 5 being treated with alpha-dihydroergocryptine and 5 with propranolol. The biochemical tests and the type of psychological profile cannot be used to predict drug response.</s><s>Serum prolactin is increased during chronic flunarizine treatment of patients suffering from migraine. In order to clarify the role of calcium in control of the secretion of anterior pituitary hormones, a study has now been made of the effects of chronic nimodipine and propranolol treatment of migraine patients on prolactin (PRL), luteinizing hormone (LH) and growth hormone (GH) levels. 11 patients were treated with nimodipine and 8 with propranolol for four months.</s><s>Prophylactic propranolol in the treatment of headache.</s><s>The prophylactic effects of the antiprostaglandin agent mefenamic acid on migraine attacks were compared with propranolol or placebo in a double-blind crossover study of 29 patients. In the 17 patients who completed the trial the frequency of attacks and their total duration were significantly reduced during mefenamic acid therapy or propranolol therapy as compared to placebo. There were no significant effects of mefenamic acid or propranolol on average duration or severity of migraine attacks.</s><s>The prophylactic effectiveness of propranolol (80 to 120 mg per day) in 18 migraine patients was compared with a placebo group of 19 migraine patients in a double blind study without cross over for a treatment period of six and twelve weeks.</s><s>The prophylactic effect of tolfenamic acid and propranolol was studied in a randomized double-blind cross-over trial of 76 patients with migraine with or without aura.

No statistical significant difference in any efficacy parameter was found between the two drugs (level 2 alpha = 0.05, alpha = 0.10). Twenty patients discontinued the study: 12 patients on propranolol and 8 patients on tolfenamic acid. Side effects were the cause of premature discontinuation of study medicine in 9 patients during propranolol treatment (dizziness, fatigue, and fall in blood pressure) and in 5 patients during tolfenamic acid treatment (gastrointestinal symptoms).</s><s>Prophylactic treatment of migraine with propranolol.

However, the current evidence in support of non pharmacological treatments in patients affected by dementia still does not allow to draw definitive conclusions on what is the most effective treatment to apply, largely because of methodological difficulties and limitations of the studies so far carried out due to the complex nature of the disease. Preliminary results show a significant performance decline only in the control group at the 9-month follow-up compared to both baseline and the 3-month follow-up.

Height velocity improved significantly with GH therapy (p less than 0.0001) and placebo (p less than 0.04), but the GH-induced height-velocity increase exceeded that of placebo by 2.9 cm per 6 months. There was a positive relationship between prestudy height velocity and height-velocity increase. GH caused a significant increase in IGF-I and a moderate increase in IGF-II plasma concentrations.</s><s>Growth retardation is a major problem for children with chronic renal insufficiency (CRI). However, during the ensuing 2 yr, the higher GH dose induced a significantly greater improvement in height velocity SD score for chronological age than 2 IU GH. The pretreatment elevation of IGF-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) levels decreased by 50% during the first study year with the higher GH dose, whereas there was no decrease with 2 IU. The elevated pretreatment IGFBP-3 levels increased comparably and significantly with either GH dose.

There were also no differences in the incidence of rejection in the first year: eight episodes in 13 patients v five episodes in nine patients, respectively. Phosphate, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), parathyroid hormone (PTH), and fasting insulin concentrations rose during the first year of treatment, but not thereafter. Treatment with rhGH improves growth in prepubertal and pubertal children with renal transplants, with no significant change in GFR or the incidence of rejection.</s><s>Anthropometric measurements and circulating growth factors were studied serially in 44 prepubertal children with growth failure and chronic renal failure (GFR = 10 to 40 ml/min/1.73 m2) who were randomized to receive either recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH; N = 30) or no treatment (N = 14).

After 18 +/- 9 weeks of therapy for all patients, hematocrit increased from 31 to 39%.</s><s>One hundred seventeen patients with anemia related to chronic renal failure not severe enough to require maintenance dialysis were randomly assigned to receive recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO; 50, 100, or 150 U/kg body weight) or placebo intravenously (IV) three times a week for 8 weeks or until their anemia was corrected. Correction of anemia (hematocrit of 40% for males, 35% for females) occurred in 87% of those given 150 U/kg, 64% of those given 100 U/kg, 46% of those given 50 U/kg rHuEPO and in 3% of the placebo group. However, it is essential that blood pressure and hematocrit be carefully monitored, particularly in hypertensive patients, to prevent the development of complications associated with hypertension.</s><s>Recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO) was administered in two phases to 12 patients with chronic renal insufficiency (creatinine clearances of 0.17-0.51 ml/second [10-30 ml/minute]) and uremic anemia. During the first eight weeks (acute phase), an equal number of patients was randomized to placebo or one of three doses of r-HuEPO (50, 100 or 150 unit/kg intravenously three times weekly). The 51Cr red cell mass also increased significantly in a dose-related manner in patients receiving r-HuEPO but did not change in the placebo group. Several adverse events occurred, but none were definitely linked to r-HuEPO. Recombinant human erythropoietin is an effective and potent treatment of anemia caused by renal failure.</s><s>To determine the efficacy and safety of recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO) in predialysis renal patients. Inpatient and outpatient facility in the Clinical Research Center of a university-based hospital. Recombinant human erythropoietin, 50, 100, or 150 IU/kg body weight or placebo given intravenously three times per week. Subjects who received active r-HuEPO showed a dose-dependent rise in hematocrit; mean hematocrit increased 41% from 0.27 +/- 0.01 to 0.38 +/- 0.01. Maximal oxygen consumption during exercise increased 9% from 16.0 mL/min.kg +/- 1.8 to 17.5 mL/min.kg +/- 1.9.</s><s>A study was undertaken to ascertain the effects of recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO) on renal function in chronic renal failure predialysis patients. Forty patients were randomized to the untreated arm and 43 patients to the treatment arm (50 U/kg r-HuEPO subcutaneously three times weekly). Baseline characteristics were comparable for the r-HuEPO-treated and untreated groups. There was a statistically significant increase in hematocrit for the r-HuEPO-treated group that was not associated with acceleration of deterioration in residual renal function. This was demonstrated by the lack of a significant (P = 0.376) between-group difference in mean change in GFR from baseline to last available value for the r-HuEPO-treated (-2.1 +/- 3.2 mL/min) and untreated (-2.8 +/- 3.5 mL/min) groups.</s><s>To examine the effects of erythropoietin on the anemia of chronic renal disease and on the rate of renal deterioration, we administered recombinant human erythropoietin to 17 patients with anemia and progressive renal failure who did not yet require dialysis (serum creatinine level, 353 to 972 mumol per liter [4.0 to 11.0 mg per deciliter]). The rate of the response depended on the initial erythropoietin dose and was similar to that observed in patients who were on dialysis. All the patients reported improvements in appetite, activity level, and sense of well-being.</s><s>Anemia is already present in patients with moderate renal failure and is a major cause of the decline in exercise capacity seen in these patients. These patients were compared to a control group of 8 patients (5 men, 3 women). The EPO group increased their total hemoglobin (THb) from 323 +/- 89 to 466 +/- 128 g (p less than 0.001) and their hemoglobin concentration from 86 +/- 8 to 117 +/- 11 milligrams (p less than 0.001). Their exercise capacity, measured by a standardized exercise test on a bicycle ergometer, increased from 128 +/- 45 to 147 +/- 57 W (p less than 0.01).</s><s>Fourteen nondialyzed patients with chronic renal insufficiency (serum creatinine 265 to 972 mumol/L [3.0 to 11.0 mg/dL]) and severe anemia (hematocrit less than 30%) were randomized to receive either recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO) or a placebo subcutaneously thrice weekly for 12 weeks or until reaching a hematocrit of 38% to 40%. No acceleration in the progression of renal failure (1/serum creatinine v time) or change in serum potassium was noted for either the placebo or treated group over the 12-week period. This resulted in functional iron deficiency and the requirement for iron supplementation. The average systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not differ significantly between the two groups of patients during the study. Quality of life was improved in all r-HuEPO-treated patients but not in those in the placebo group.</s>"

Peak concentrations as well as the time required to achieve them were similar in the intramuscular and high-dose intravenous groups. All blood concentrations exceeded the 99% in vitro inhibitory concentration (EC99) of 0.89 mg/l or less of quinine for 60 isolates of Plasmodium falciparum, which were taken from children with malaria during the same period. The time taken to clear parasites with both the high-dose intravenous and intramuscular regimens were significantly shorter than those obtained in the low-dose group. We have also shown for the first time that the rate of parasite clearance can be directly related to the area under the quinine concentration versus time curve. This applied to all three quinine regimens (r = 0.4252, P less than 0.02; n less than or equal to 35).

By this time it was also apparent that at posttreatment and at 6 months follow-up no benefit was being realized from combining cognitive-behavior therapy with desipramine.</s><s>Two treatments for bulimia nervosa have emerged as having established efficacy: cognitive-behavioral therapy and antidepressant medication. Patients receiving medication in combination with psychological treatment experienced greater improvement in binge eating and depression than did patients receiving placebo and psychological treatment. In addition, cognitive-behavioral therapy plus medication was superior to medication alone, but supportive psychotherapy plus medication was not. At present, cognitive-behavioral therapy is the psychological treatment of choice for bulimia nervosa.</s><s>This study examined the relative effectiveness of desipramine, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and their combination in the treatment of bulimia nervosa, together with the effects of withdrawing medication after two different lengths of treatment. Seventy-one patients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for bulimia nervosa, recruited from an eating disorders clinic or by advertisements, were assigned at random to one of five groups: desipramine (withdrawn at 16 or 24 weeks), combined treatment (medication withdrawn at 16 or 24 weeks), and cognitive-behavioral therapy (15 sessions). At 16 weeks, both cognitive-behavioral therapy and the combined treatment were superior to medication given for 16 weeks in reducing binge eating and purging. At 32 weeks, however, only the combined 24-week treatment was superior to medication given for 16 weeks. Overall, the results favor the use of a combination of medication and cognitive-behavioral therapy in the treatment of bulimia nervosa, with medication continued for at least 24 weeks.</s><s>This study compared and combined fluoxetine and individual cognitive behavioral therapy in the treatment of bulimia nervosa. Participants were 76 women who sought treatment at the Eating Disorders Program of the Toronto Hospital and who met DSM-III-R criteria for bulimia nervosa. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive fluoxetine alone, cognitive behavior therapy alone, or the two in combination and were treated over 16 weeks. Short-term outcome revealed that all three treatment conditions were associated with clinical improvement across a wide range of parameters.</s><s>The aims of the paper are to determine whether nutritional counselling is associated with an improvement in bulimic symptomatology, whether this improvement is maintained during post-treatment follow-up, and whether the addition of fluoxetine 3 x 20 mg/day confers additional benefit. After a 1-week 'wash-out', active treatment was given over 8 weeks, followed by post-treatment interviews at 12 and 20 weeks. Fluoxetine patients decreased their energy intake and lost a modest amount of weight. They went on to regain weight during the follow-up period, returning to levels higher than they were initially. The addition of fluoxetine may confer some benefit during active treatment, but its discontinuation may contribute to a higher rate of recurrence of symptoms post treatment.</s><s>Previous research on the treatment of outpatients with bulimia nervosa has focused on two treatment strategies: (1) drug therapy, primarily using tricyclic antidepressants, and (2) psychotherapy, often employing behavioral and cognitive behavioral techniques. The addition of antidepressant treatment to the intensive group psychotherapy component did not significantly improve outcome over intensive group psychotherapy combined with placebo treatment in terms of eating behavior, but did result in more improvement in the symptoms of depression and anxiety.</s><s>In a double-blind trial 40 patients with bulimia nervosa according to DSM III-R criteria were randomly assigned either to a 60 mg fluoxetine group or to a placebo control group. Parallel to the drug trial, patients participated in an intensive inpatient behavioral psychotherapy program. In self-ratings and expert ratings concerning attitudes towards eating, eating behavior, and general psychopathology, significant improvements over time were observed in both groups. Results show that the intensive inpatient-care and psychotherapy program was highly effective in changing eating behavior and attitudes as well as general psychopathology. These results can possibly be explained by the existence of a \"ceiling effect\".</s>"

In this population of 35 patients with BCC, 24 received imiquimod 5% cream and 11 received vehicle cream in 1 of 5 dosing regimens for up to 16 weeks. Adverse events were predominantly local reactions at the target tumor site, with the incidence and severity of local skin reactions declining in groups dosed less frequently.</s><s>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is increasingly used as a noninvasive treatment for nodular basal cell carcinoma (BCC), without a sound evidence base. Primary end point was clinically assessed lesion clearance at 3 months after treatment. Complete response rates did not differ significantly between groups (51/52 [98%] lesions with surgery vs 48/53 [91%] lesions with methyl aminolevulinate PDT; difference [95% confidence interval], 4.8% (-3.4% to 13.0%]; P =.25). At 12 months, tumor-free rates were 50 (96%) of 52 lesions with surgery vs 44 (83%) of 53 with methyl aminolevulinate PDT (P =.15). More patients treated with methyl aminolevulinate PDT than surgery had an excellent or good cosmetic outcome at all time points (significant at 12 and 24 months on patient assessment, P<.05, and at 3, 12, and 24 months on investigator evaluation, P<.001). At 24 months, 5 lesions that had initially cleared with methyl aminolevulinate PDT had recurred, compared with 1 after surgery. Methyl aminolevulinate PDT is an effective treatment for nodular BCC, and while there is a trend for higher recurrence with this modality, it conveys the advantage over surgery of better cosmesis.</s><s>Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) are very frequent cutaneous cancers, often located on the face. Cure rates with surgery and radiotherapy are high, but these treatments have never been compared prospectively. A randomized trial was initiated in 1982 to compare surgery and radiotherapy in the treatment of primary BCC of the face measuring less than 4 cm. The primary end point was the failure rate (persistent or recurrent disease) after 4 years of follow-up. Of the 173 patients in the radiotherapy group, 55% were treated with interstitial brachytherapy, 33% with contactherapy and 12% with conventional radiotherapy. The cosmetic results assessed by four of the five judges were significantly better after surgery than after radiotherapy.</s><s>To establish a safe and efficacious dosing regimen for the treatment of primary nodular basal cell carcinoma (BCC) using 5% imiquimod cream. The study populations comprised 99 patients enrolled in the 6-week study and 92 patients in the 12-week study. Patients were at least 18 years old and had a biopsy-confirmed diagnosis of nodular BCC. In the 6-week study, imiquimod was applied once daily for 3 or 7 days per week or twice daily for 3 or 7 days per week. Dosing once daily for 7 days per week resulted in the highest clearance rate, with 25 (71%) of 35 and 16 (76%) of 21 patients showing clearance of their tumor in the 6- and 12-week studies, respectively. Topical 5% imiquimod cream is well tolerated and most effective in treating nodular BCC when applied once daily for 7 days per week for either 12 or 6 weeks.</s><s>Imiquimod 5% cream has been investigated for non-surgical treatment of superficial and nodular basal cell carcinoma (BCC) tumours. Two studies were conducted to examine the effect of occlusion at low dosing frequencies on the safety and efficacy of topical imiquimod 5% cream for the treatment of superficial and nodular BCC. Patients were randomized to one of four groups to apply imiquimod 5% cream 2 or 3 days per week either with or without occlusion. In both studies, the highest histologically complete response rate was seen in the 3 days per week with occlusion groups, with complete response rates of 87% and 65% for the superficial and nodular studies, respectively. Occlusion did not have a statistically significant effect on response rate at either dosing frequency. Response rates for superficial and nodular BCC tumours treated 3 days per week without occlusion were 76% and 50%, respectively.</s><s>Interferons (IFN), especially alfa-2a and 2b, are potent inhibitors of normal and malignant cell growth and effective choices in the treatment of basal cell carcinoma (BCC). A total of 45 patients with histopathologically confirmed BCC were divided into three groups, equally. IFN alfa-2a and 2b were injected alternately in Group 3 (5 IFN alfa-2a and 5 IFN alfa-2b). Eight weeks after completion of therapy, cytologic specimens were taken, and all cases were evaluated clinically and cytologically. Ten (66.6%) patients had a complete response (CR) and 5 (33.3%) had a partial response (PR) in Group 1. These results suggest that IFN alfa-2a, 2b, and the combination of 2a and 2b appear to be effective choices for the treatment of BCC; the effectiveness is not increased by their combination.</s><s>Imiquimod is an immune response modifier that acts through toll-like receptor 7 to induce cytokine production and a subsequent innate and adaptive cell-mediated immune response. The target tumour location was identified with an indelible ink mark before treatment initiation. Efficacy assessments included the composite response rates (proportion of subjects with clinical and histological clearance) and response rates solely based on histology (proportion of subjects with histological clearance). For the intent-to-treat dataset, there was a statistically significant difference between imiquimod and vehicle groups for both composite clearance rates (clinical and histological assessments) and histological clearance rates. Composite clearance was demonstrated in 77% and 6% of subjects treated with imiquimod and vehicle cream, respectively. Imiquimod 5% cream administered 7 x/week for 6 weeks is a safe and effective treatment for sBCC when compared with vehicle cream.</s><s>Efficient treatment of patients with multiple synchronous nonmelanoma skin cancers represents a therapeutic challenge. Clinical and cosmetic responses were assessed and graded at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after verteporfin PDT, with optional follow-up visits at 12, 18, and 24 months. The histopathologic response, defined as absence of tumor on biopsy specimens 6 months after verteporfin PDT, ranged from 69% at 60 J/cm(2) to 93% at 180 J/cm(2). No significant systemic adverse events were observed; most events occurred at the treated tumor sites and included events such as pain. A single course of verteporfin PDT showed treatment benefit for patients with multiple nonmelanoma skin cancers.</s><s>Intralesional interferon alfa-2b has been proven effective in the treatment of basal cell carcinomas. In this study, 65 basal cell carcinomas were treated in one of two dosing schedules with intralesional sustained release interferon alfa-2b (10 million IU per injection). Thirty-three patients received a single injection and 32 patients received one injection per week for 3 weeks.</s><s>In certain situations, successful topical therapy of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) without the inconvenience, risk, and expense of surgery would be of great value to patients. Placing 5-fluorouracil (FU) in an appropriate carrier may solve these problems. We propose that employing PC as a vehicle will facilitate the penetration of 5-FU and increase efficacy as compared to petrolatum-based 5-FU cream. Thirteen patients with 17 biopsy-proven, moderate thickness BCCs were randomized to receive either cream A (5% 5-FU in a PC vehicle) or cream B (Efudex(R): 5% 5-FU in a petrolatum base). Although the study was unable to detect any statistically significant differences in outcome between the study groups, this small pilot study shows preliminary findings which may indicate an increase in the short-term eradication of BCC using a PC-based vehicle as compared to conventional petrolatum-based formulations.</s><s>In a clinical trial of 172 patients at four medical centers, interferon alfa-2b (1.5 x 10(6) IU) or a placebo was injected directly into biopsy-proved noduloulcerative or superficial basal cell carcinomas three times weekly for 3 weeks, for a cumulative dose of 13.5 million IU. Efficacy of treatment was determined at 16 to 20 weeks by examination of biopsy specimens that demonstrated cure of lesions in 86% of interferon-treated patients and in only 29% of placebo-treated patients. Side effects of treatment, mainly flu-like symptoms, were usually mild and transient and occurred more commonly in the interferon-treated group. Only three patients, all in the interferon-treated group, discontinued therapy because of side effects. For some patients with noduloulcerative or superficial basal cell carcinomas, intralesional interferon alfa-2b may be an alternative, effective treatment.</s><s>To develop a nonsurgical treatment alternative for basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), we evaluated intralesional sustained-release chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil/epinephrine injectable gel (5-FU/epi gel). To optimize the dose and treatment schedule, we compared the safety, tolerance, and efficacy of six treatment regimens of 5-FU/epi gel in patients with BCCs. No clinically significant treatment-related systemic adverse events occurred. The complete response rate based on histologic assessment in this group was 100%. Results demonstrate that treatment of BCC with 5-FU/epi gel is both safe and effective, may result in histologically confirmed complete response rates comparable to surgery, and provides a nonsurgical treatment alternative in selected patients.</s><s>A prospective randomised trial to compare radiotherapy and cryotherapy in the treatment of basal-cell carcinomas was carried out in 93 patients. It is concluded that cryotherapy does not offer a satisfactory alternative to radiotherapy in the treatment of basal-cell carcinomas.</s><s>Imiquimod 5% cream may provide an effective nonsurgical treatment for superficial basal cell carcinoma (sBCC) based on results of previous studies. Patients (n = 128) were dosed twice daily, once daily, 5 times a week, or 3 times a week in this 12-week, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study. At 6 weeks after treatment, the entire tumor area was clinically evaluated, excised, and examined exhaustively for histologic evidence of residual sBCC. Complete response rates were 100% (10/10), 87.1% (27/31), 80.8% (21/26), and 51.7% (15/29) for patients in the twice daily, once daily, 5 times a week, and 3 times a week imiquimod groups, respectively, and 18.8% (6/32) in the vehicle group.</s><s>Imiquimod is an immune response modifier that is a Toll-like receptor 7 agonist that induces interferon and other cytokines through the innate immune system and stimulates cell-mediated immunity through T cells. Imiquimod has been shown to be efficacious as a topical treatment for basal cell carcinoma (BCC). The lesion site was clinically examined 12 weeks posttreatment and then excised for histological evaluation. Histological clearance rates for the 5 and 7x/week imiquimod groups were 82% and 79%, respectively. Increasing severity of erythema, erosion, and scabbing/crusting was associated with higher clearance rates. Imiquimod appears to be safe and effective for the treatment of sBCC when compared with vehicle cream.</s><s>The aim of this prospective randomized study was to compare the clinical and cosmetic outcome of superficial basal cell carcinomas (BCC), using either laser or broadband halogen light, in photodynamic therapy with topical 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA). Of these, 80 lesions (84%) in the laser group and 101 lesions (92%) in the lamp group were independently evaluated to have an excellent or good cosmetic post-treatment score.</s><s>Rates of recurrence of facial basal-cell carcinoma are consistently lower after Mohs' micrographic surgery (MMS) than after other treatments, such as surgical excision (SE). 408 primary and 204 recurrent facial carcinomas (374 and 191 patients, respectively) were analysed separately in this prospective randomised study. Of the basal-cell carcinomas included in the trial, 397 primary (198 MMS, 199 SE) and 201 recurrent (99, 102) tumours were actually treated. Of the primary carcinomas, five (3%) recurred after SE compared with three (2%) after MMS during 30 months of follow-up. Of the recurrent carcinomas, three (3%) recurred after SE and none after MMS during 18 months of follow-up. Although both differences favoured MMS, they were not significant (primary, difference 1% [95% CI -2.5% to 3.7%], p=0.724; recurrent, 3.2% [-2.0% to 5.0%], p=0.119). No definitive conclusion on recurrence rates of primary or recurrent basal-cell carcinomas is yet possible.</s><s>Superficial basal cell carcinoma (sBCC) is an increasingly common tumor in fair-skinned populations throughout the world. We conducted a multicenter, randomized, open-label dose-response trial of imiquimod 5% cream in the treatment of primary sBCC assessing efficacy and safety of different dose regimens. Intention-to-treat analysis revealed 100% (3/3) histologic clearance in the twice-daily regimen, 87.9% (29/33) clearance in the once every day regimen, 73.3% (22/30) clearance in the twice-daily 3 times/week regimen, and 69.7% (23/33) clearance in the once-daily 3 times/week regimen. Dose-related inflammatory skin reactions at the site of application were common. The majority were well tolerated and only 1 patient withdrew from the trial as a result of a medication-related skin reaction.</s>"

The levothyroxine group was randomized to continue or discontinue levothyroxine after 1 year. Kaplan-Meier analyses showed relapse rates to be similar in the levothyroxine group (20% after 1 year, 32% after 2 years) and the randomized controls (18%, 24%), whereas relapses were significantly more frequent in the follow-up group of patients with endogenously suppressed TSH (33%, 49%). Levothyroxine therapy did not influence TSH-receptor antibody, nor did it reduce goiter size. The study demonstrates that levothyroxine does not prevent relapse of hyperthyroidism after successful restoration of euthyroid function by antithyroid drugs and characterizes posttreatment TSH as a main prognostic marker.</s><s>Regardless the autoimmune origin of Graves' disease, the preferred method of its treatment remains antithyroid drug administration. The aim of the study was to assess the influence of early immunosuppressive treatment of autoimmune thyrotoxicosis with azathioprine on the course of the disease and the incidence of its complications. The dose of both drugs was adjusted during the treatment according to metabolic status of each patients. The treatment was continued for 8-14 months, the follow-up duration after therapy withdrawal was 5 years. Euthyreosis was achieved in all patients 2-8 weeks after treatment initiation. In four patients additionally treated with azathioprine, gastrointestinal side effects or leucopenia were present. The patients of group I were also more frequently referred to surgical treatment due to rapid goitre growth (accordingly 5 (17.8%) and 1 (2.7%) patients, p=0.07), the difference between both groups not being statistically significant. Additional early immunosuppressive treatment significantly decreased frequency of Graves' disease complications and thyrotoxicosis recurrence.</s><s>A direct immunosuppressive action of antithyroid drugs (ATD) has been suggested by the progressive decrease of thyroid antibodies during treatment. High doses of ATD were then proposed to improve the level of remissions of Graves' disease but the results of such high doses remain a matter of controversies. After 18 months of therapy and a 2-year follow-up the remissions are 70.9% with high and 53% with low doses (p = 0.03).</s><s>A prospective randomized study was performed in patients with hyperthyroid Graves' disease (GD) in order to compare long (18 months) and short term (6 months) antithyroid drug treatment on the remission rate. A therapeutic protocol was offered to all GD patients who had not been treated for this disease previously. Of the patients having undergone long term treatment, 61.8% still were in remission 2 yr after treatment withdrawal, whereas only 41.7% of the patients treated for 6 months were in remission (P less than 0.05). Such findings clearly establish that treatment duration has a direct beneficial incidence on the remission rate. Only the thyroid-stimulating antibody levels determined at the time of diagnosis and at the end of treatment were higher in the relapse group, a difference that was relevant only globally, due to value scattering.</s><s>Sixty patients with Graves' disease (GD) hyperthyroidism were distributed in two randomized groups. Serum TSH persisted undetectable in 16 out of 60 patients (group A: 9; group B: 7), after treatment. Relapse occurred in 38 patients (63.3%), (group A: 18 (60%) vs. group B: 20 (66.7%)). Eighty-seven percent (14/16) of patients with undetectable TSH after therapy relapsed, vs. 54.5% (24/44) of those with normal TSH (P = 0.01). Undetectable TSH at the end of treatment was the only independent variable in the logistic analysis to predict relapse. This study has found that, in Spanish patients, the use of high doses of carbimazole with T4 offers no advantages in the treatment of GD hyperthyroidism.</s><s>Antibodies to thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptors that stimulate the thyroid gland cause hyperthyroidism in patients with Graves' disease, and their production during antithyroid drug treatment is an important determinant of the course of the disease. One factor that might contribute to the persistent production of antibodies to TSH receptors is stimulation of the release of thyroid antigens by TSH during antithyroid drug therapy. We therefore studied the effect of the suppression of TSH secretion by thyroxine on the levels of antibodies to TSH receptors after thyroid hormone secretion had been normalized by methimazole. Sixty patients then received 100 micrograms of thyroxine and 10 mg of methimazole and 49 received placebo and 10 mg of methimazole daily for one year. In the thyroxine-treated group, the mean serum thyroxine concentration increased from 108 +/- 16 nmol per liter to 145 +/- 11 nmol per liter (P less than 0.01), and the level of antibodies to TSH receptors decreased from 28 +/- 10 percent to 10 +/- 3 percent after one month of combination therapy. One patient in the thyroxine-treated group (1.7 percent) and 17 patients in the placebo group (34.7 percent) had recurrences of hyperthyroidism within three years after the discontinuation of methimazole. The administration of thyroxine during antithyroid drug treatment decreases both the production of antibodies to TSH receptors and the frequency of recurrence of hyperthyroidism.</s><s>The optimal treatment regimen with thionamide drugs remains a matter for debate. Thirty-seven patients with a first episode of Graves' disease were enrolled. During the 6 months of treatment we evaluated the rate of normalization of serum thyroid function tests, changes in serum thyroid auto-antibody levels and the rate of side-effects during treatment. However, for those patients who completed 6 months of treatment (high-dose group = 9, low-dose group = 16), multivariate survival analysis demonstrated a significantly longer median relapse-free interval (P < 0.04) in the high-dose group (27 weeks; 25th percentile: 9.6 weeks, 75th percentile: 75 weeks) versus the low-dose group (6 weeks; 25th percentile: 4.8 weeks, 75th percentile: 13.1 weeks). High-dose carbimazole treatment delays, but does not prevent, relapse from Graves' disease in those patients able to tolerate the treatment. However, it leads to more frequent side-effects than conventional dose treatment.</s><s>Antithyroid drugs are effective in patients with hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease, but the rate of recurrence after treatment is high. If these results are confirmed, combined therapy with an antithyroid drug and T4 might become the treatment of choice for all patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism. Then one group received carbimazole alone for 17 months (52 patients), and the other group received carbimazole plus T4 for 17 months and T4 alone for 18 months (59 patients). In the carbimazole group, the dose was adjusted after one month to maintain a normal serum thyrotropin concentration. At the time of our analysis, 53 of the 111 patients had completed at least 3 months of follow-up (median, 12 months) after carbimazole was withdrawn. The administration of T4 to patients with Graves' disease during carbimazole treatment and after its withdrawal neither delays nor prevents the recurrence of hyperthyroidism.</s><s>Medical treatment of Graves' disease involves antithyroid drugs with or without the addition of exogenous T4. There have been conflicting reports as to whether the addition of T4 improves remission rates or delays relapse. To evaluate this issue in a North American population, 199 patients were treated with methimazole until they were euthyroid. After 18 months, methimazole was stopped, and T4 was continued in groups 2 and 3. One hundred forty-nine patients have been followed for at least 6 months after stopping methimazole (mean 27 months). Among those patients who did relapse, however, there was a significant difference in the months to relapse after stopping methimazole between groups B and 1 (group 1: 3.3 +/- 0.7, group A: 5.6 +/- 0.8, group B: 7.4 +/- 1.7; P = 0.01 for the comparison between groups B and 1).</s><s>To investigate the significance of treatment with antithyroid drugs longer than 12 months on lasting remission in Graves' hyperthyroid patients, and to study clinical and laboratory parameters of prognostic value. They were treated with carbimazole during 12 and 24 months in Group I (n = 28) and Group II (n = 24), respectively. At the end of the short-term period, relapse had occurred in 13 (46.4%) Group I patients and in 13 (54.1%) Group II patients, p = 0.36. No difference could be observed between patients who had stayed in remission and who had suffered relapse, within the 5-yr follow-up period regarding to goiter size, frequency of ophthalmopathy, TSH and TRAb levels. The high relapse rate observed could be due to high iodine intake in our country.</s><s>In Graves' hyperthyroidism treated with antithyroid drugs (ATD), the overall relapse rate reaches 30-50% following ATD discontinuation. Also, clinicians are in search of useful parameters to predict the risk of a recurrence of hyperthyroidism after ATD treatment. Following ATD discontinuation, the patients were randomly assigned (double-blind placebo-controlled trial) to taking 100 microg/day l-T4 (vs placebo) for an additional year. During ATD treatment, serum free T4 and T3 and TSH concentrations were recorded after 1 (optional), 2, 4, 6, 9, 12 and 15 months, and echography at the end of ATD treatment. During the randomized trial, serum free T4 and T3 and TSH concentrations were checked every 3 months (or until a recurrence). Two parameters were identified that might be useful to help predict recurrence risks after ATD: (i) positive TSHR-Ab (at the end of ATD treatment) was significantly associated with a greatly increased recurrence risk; and (ii) despite the relatively small number of patients who were smokers, regular cigarette smoking was shown, for the first time, to be significantly associated with an increased recurrence risk. Two factors, namely positive TSHR-Ab at the end of ATD treatment and regular smoking habits may represent clinically useful (albeit not absolute) predictors of the risk of recurrence in patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism treated with ATD. However, due to the relatively small number of smoking patients in the present cohort, this conclusion needs to be confirmed by a larger study.</s><s>TSH has been incriminated in Graves' disease for increasing the production of antibodies against TSH receptor (TRAb). It has been, therefore, suggested that T4 administration after successful antithyroid drug (ATD) treatment may indirectly decrease the production of TRAb and, therefore, the frequency of recurrence of hyperthyroidism. During the follow-up period, patients daily received either 100 microg T4 or 25 microg T3 or placebo after random and double-blinded assignment into three groups. At 12 months of the follow-up period, 14 out of 33 (42.4%), 6 out of 38 (15.8%), and 9 out of 37 (24.3%) patients receiving T4, T3 and placebo, respectively, recurred. Recurrence rate of T4-treated patients was statistically higher than that of the T3-treated patients or controls (p < 0.05). We conclude that T4 administration after successful ATD treatment of Graves' disease is associated with increased recurrence of hyperthyroidism as compared to the T3 or placebo administration.</s><s>We evaluated whether antithyroid drug treatment could be terminated more appropriately when both the serum basal thyrotrophin (TSH) level and TSH receptor antibody activity have become normal. This was a prospective randomized study of patients with Graves' disease followed for a mean of 28 months after the withdrawal of antithyroid drug treatment. A total of 174 patients with hyperthyroid Graves' disease were entered consecutively into this study, 11 of whom were subsequently excluded. One hundred and sixty-three patients were divided randomly into two groups having different criteria for the discontinuation of the antithyroid drug. All patients were treated initially with 400 mg/day of propylthiouracil followed by decreasing doses that maintained a euthyroid state. The mean duration of treatment in Group 1 was 10.2 +/- 4.5 months (range 5-24, median 10). Median duration of treatment in Group 1 was 14 months shorter than in Group 2. In Group 1, the relapse rate was independent of the duration of the treatment. When both the serum TSH level and TBII activity were normalized, the relapse rate of Group 2 was not significantly different from that of Group I for treatment periods of 6-12 months (25 vs 24.2%, P greater than 0.1), 12-18 months (33.3 vs 40%, P greater than 0.1), and 18-24 months (46.2 vs 50%, P greater than 0.1). Of the clinical and laboratory parameters measured, male sex, change of goitre size during treatment, and TSH levels and TBII values at the end of treatment, were of prognostic significance in predicting a relapse.</s><s>To compare the relapse rates in Graves' disease the first 2 years after methimazole 60 mg day-1 combined with thyroxine versus a titration regimen with methimazole alone, and to look for possible prognostic factors. Methimazole was given for 6 months in both groups, and thyroid status evaluated every 3rd month during the first year, and every 6th month during the second year. The study was performed at our outpatient clinic with patients referred from primary care. Thus, 19 patients in the high- and 22 in the low-dose group completed 6 months with methimazole. In those tolerating the treatment, the relapse rates in the high- and low-dose groups were 26.3 vs. 59.1% (P < 0.05), 42.1 vs. 77.3% (P < 0.02); and 57.9 vs. 77.3% (NS) after 3, 12 and 24 months, respectively. The corresponding relapse rates calculated on an 'intention to treat' basis were: 51.7 vs. 66.7%; 62.1 vs. 81.5%: 72.4 vs. 81.5% (NS).</s><s>In a prospective, randomized study of 135 newly diagnosed patients with hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease we compared the effect on remission rates of additional triiodothyronine (T3) with conventional antithyroid drug therapy. 1mU/l), which could be achieved in 82% of patients on 100% of their monthly visits. No significant difference (P>0.05, Chi square) was seen in relapse of hyperthyroidism after a mean follow-up of 16 months (range: 12-31 months; groups 1:52%, 2:44% and 3:42%) in an area of low-to-moderate iodine intake (prevalence of 24h urinary iodine excretion <100 microgram/24h: 17 and 25% at two different measurements respectively). Concomitantly, no predictor of recurrence of disease could be identified, irrespective of treatment modality.</s><s>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the possible influence of 2 different methods of treatment (antithyroid drugs and antithyroid drugs plus levothyroxine) on the number of recurrences in Graves' disease, as well as to study the possible prognostic factors for the evolution of the disease. Group A included those patients treated with decreasing doses of carbimazole and group B included patients treated with high doses of carbimazole plus levothyroxine. The follow-up of these patients was carried out over a minimum of 36 months after discontinuation of treatment. No significant differences were observed in either the clinical characteristics or hormonal or antibody values in both groups on initiation and at the end of treatment. Recurrence was not correlated with either the clinical or biochemical parameters evaluated, although it did correlate with goiter size with recurrence observed in 100% of the patients with goiter greater than or equal to II.</s><s>To investigate the effect of different antithyroid drug (ATD) regimens on relapse rates of Graves' disease, and to look for predictors of relapse. After discontinuation of antithyroid therapy, each group was stratified to either 12 Months further treatment with l-T(4) or no treatment. Clinical and biochemical assessments were carried out before treatment, after 3 and 6 weeks, and every third Month for 12 Months. If the patients lacked symptoms of relapse, laboratory tests were performed every third Month for the second Year, and thereafter annually. Similarly, relapse was more frequent (55.5%) in patients having large goiter compared with subjects with small goiter (36.3%, P=0.0007). Relapse rates of Graves' disease were independent of ATD regimen whether followed by l-T(4) therapy or not.</s><s>Antithyroid drugs are commonly used as first-line treatment for Graves' disease, but the optimum regimen for inducing remission remains unclear. The remission rate one year after cessation of treatment was 59% with the 6 month course and 65% with 12 months; this was not significantly different. These results show that six months treatment with a block-replace regimen of antithyroid drugs is probably sufficient, in the UK, to achieve maximum remission of Graves' disease and that there are no HLA markers which clearly predict outcome.</s><s>Although antithyroid drugs (ATD) are widely used in the treatment of Graves' disease, management protocols, especially treatment duration, remain a subject of debate. As no prospective study has provided data on even longer protocols exceeding 2 years, we conducted a prospective trial to determine potential benefits of a 42-month treatment compared with an 18-month treatment. The aim of this prospective randomized trial was to compare relapse rates achieved two years after treatment withdrawal in patients who received carbimazole at decreasing doses for 18 months (n = 62) vs 42 months (n = 72). Although the percentage of patients with TSAb was significantly lower in the 42-month treatment group (18% vs 42%, P = 0.004) at treatment withdrawal, the percentage of TSAb-positive patients did not significantly decrease between 18 and 42 months in this group (27% vs 18%, NS). Treatment duration greater than 18 months did not improve remission rate determined 2 years after treatment withdrawal or immunological variables or early iodine uptake measured at the time of discontinuation of treatment. These findings would indicate that, when a defined duration treatment is planned, prolonging treatment beyond 18 months does not provide any additional benefit.</s><s>The optimal antithyroid drug regimen for Graves' disease remains a matter of controversy. Extended follow-up of patients from a prospective multicentre trial, designed to study methimazole dose effects on the outcome of Graves' disease. In this paper, we describe the outcome in these patients after a mean observation period of 4.3 +/- 1.3 years and have looked for potential predictors of this outcome. At the time of inclusion into the trial: thyroid size, T4, T3, TSH-binding inhibiting immunoglobulins, urinary iodide excretion, thyroid uptake, Crook's therapeutic index of hyperthyroidism (a measure of clinical disease severity). At the time of follow-up examination: TSH, T4, T3, thyroid size, thyroid ultrasound, THS-binding inhibiting immunoglobulins. Thus, none of these variables was potentially suitable for predicting outcome. The dose of methimazole in Graves' disease therapy can safely be kept to the minimal required dose. This will provide the same chance of remission as higher doses, and provide the best balance of risk and benefit.</s><s>Based on findings that thyroxine may have a beneficial effect on the recurrence of Graves' hyperthyroidism, we prospectively studied the effects of a TSH suppressive treatment with thyroxine on the course of Graves' disease in fifty patients with recent onset of hyperthyroidism. By the end of the second year, a relapse of hyperthyroidism had occurred in 43% of the patients with and in 45% of the patients without suppressive T4 treatment. However, patients on suppressive T4 treatment tended to have a greater reduction in thyroid volume than patients with normal TSH serum concentrations (P = 0.05). In conclusion, we were unable to detect a preventive effect of exogenous TSH suppression on the recurrence of hyperthyroidism.</s><s>A comparative study of high-dose (HD, carbimazole 60 mg plus thyroxine 100-150 micrograms daily) and titration-dose (TD) regimens of carbimazole was carried out in 70 patients with Graves' disease, the patients being assigned randomly to one or other regimen. The treatment was given for 1 year and follow-up was for 2 years after stopping treatment. By 2 years after stopping treatment, recurrence had occurred in 50% of the HD and 66% of the TD group. Cigarette smoking was similar in both the groups and did not influence the frequency of relapse.</s>"

Comprehensive treatment approach for patellofemoral pain syndrome in young women.</s><s>Patellofemoral pain (PFP) and abnormal patellofemoral congruence (PFC) are common athletic problems whose treatment remains controversial. A sample of 100 subjects was randomly divided into two groups: control and treatment. All subjects of both groups were tested for PFC, using a Merchant x-ray view, function, via Kujala patellofemoral score (KPS), and pain, through a visual analog scale (VAS), initially and then 4 wk later. CONCLUSIONS/CLINICAL RELEVANCE: It was concluded that the treatment reduced PFP and PFC as compared with the control.</s><s>The goal of this prospective study was to evaluate the efficacy of open versus closed kinetic chain exercises in the nonoperative management of patellofemoral pain. Sixty patients were randomized into a 5-week program that consisted of only closed kinetic chain exercises or only open kinetic chain exercises. Both groups experienced a statistically significant decrease in pain and an increase in functional performance. This study shows that both open and closed kinetic chain exercise programs lead to an improved subjective and clinical outcome in patients with anterior knee pain.</s><s>The authors have studied the efficacy of 3 different muscle training programs (electromyostimulation, isokinetic training and isometric training) in cases of patellar chondromalacia.

The study design was a pretest-posttest control design with two posttest points. The 137 subjects were selected randomly from three first-ranked teaching hospitals. Twenty-three subjects in the experimental group and 23 in the control group from each hospital participated in the study. The control group had the same sequence of sessions with a presentation by the researcher on theory analysis in nursing. The significant difference on means of the CGHQ in posttest 1 at week 2 showed that the self-reported psychophysiologic health level responded to the relaxation training earlier than to the self-reported work stress level.</s><s>This study examined coping strategies and occupational burnout in a sample of 118 health-care providers. Subjects who participated in a 6-week program designed to improve coping reported significant short-term decreases in emotional exhaustion and lack of personal accomplishment, two dimensions of burnout. Subjects who received 1-hr coping \"refresher\" sessions at 5, 11, and 17 months showed consistent decreases in burnout throughout the 2-year period.</s><s>The purpose of this randomized controlled trial was to test the efficacy and effectiveness of process consultation consisting of a series of nurse manager-consultant problem-solving meetings for leadership development that would lead to their staff's improved morale, quality of care, and reduced absenteeism. Demographic data and information regarding family life responsibilities were collected as well. Assessment of quality of care was determined by the frequency and type of incident reports and by patients' perception of their satisfaction. A ratio of absence hours to total paid hours of work was used to compare experimental and control units' absenteeism rates. These organizational changes were accompanied by improved working relationships and less alienation from work. However, a subanalysis of the units by \"dose\" of the intervention identified those who benefited from the effects of the consultation. Subjects whose nurse managers participated more actively in the consultation process accounted for the changes in working relationships and perceived organizational changes.</s><s>The purpose of the study was to examine the effectiveness of assertiveness training in improving self-perceived levels of stress and assertiveness among nurses in Taiwan, Republic of China. The two-group experimental design was conducted in a 2,000-bed veteran general hospital. Subjects in each group participated in six 2-hour workshops in the same two-week period.</s><s>All fourteen nurses working in a burn unit were given three hours of individual training in cognitive behavioral stress management skills.

        "Abstracts": "<s>Strictly enforced antibiotic formulary restriction in combination with formulation of agreed guidelines for antibiotic use in common infection problems such as septicemia, febrile neutropenia, urinary tract infection, biliary sepsis, liver abscess, peritonitis, nosocomial pneumonia, soft tissue infection and purulent meningitis, generated a combined savings of 307,748.5 bahts or 13.5 per cent cost reduction over a 6 month period, and improved quality of use, appropriate 54.8 vs 67.5 per cent, statistically significance (P less than 0.002). In the months during the restrictions, no significant changes occurred regarding patients response and mortality. Moreover, the antibiotic use control was operationally successful, most house-staff and attending physicians, not only antibiotic evaluating team, have accepted the program in a very positive way. We are now continuing our program and also trying to modify so that it will be useful to all departments in the hospital.</s><s>The objectives of this study were to reduce the quantity and improve the quality of surgical prophylaxis and to reduce costs. Process outcome parameters were antibiotic choice, duration, timing, antibiotic volume and costs. Segmented regression analysis was used to estimate the effect size of the intervention. After the intervention, antibiotic choice was inappropriate in only 37.5% of the cases instead of in 93.5% expected cases had the intervention not occurred. The intervention led to improved quality of surgical prophylaxis and to reduced antibiotic use and costs without impairment of patient outcome.</s><s>Society for Health Care Epidemiology guidelines recommend decreasing the use of fluoroquinolone antibiotics in institutions where methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is endemic. An 87-bed Veterans Affairs teaching hospital with an extended-care facility. After the intervention, fluoroquinolone use decreased by approximately 34%, and levofloxacin use decreased by approximately 50%. Decreased fluoroquinolone use was offset by increased cephalosporin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole use. The nosocomial MRSA infection rate decreased from 1.37 to 0.63 episodes per 1,000 patient-days after the study intervention (P=.02). Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and Enterococcus infection rates also decreased.</s><s>Fear of infection in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) often leads to early use of empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics, a strategy that selects for resistant bacteria. We investigated whether the emergence of resistant strains could be halted by modifying the empiric antibiotic regimens to remove the selective pressure that favours resistant bacteria. There were 436 admissions, divided equally between the two regimens (218 in each). Three neonates treated with the penicillin-tobramycin regimen became colonised with bacilli resistant to the empirical therapy used versus 41 neonates on the amoxicillin-cefotaxime regimen (p<.0001). Enterobacter cloacae was the predominant bacillus in neonates on the amoxicillin-cefotaxime regimen, whereas Escherichia coli predominated in neonates on the penicillin-tobramycin regimen. These colonisation patterns were also seen when the units exchanged regimens.</s><s>To determine whether a computerized decision support system could increase the proportion of oral quinolone antibiotic orders placed for hospitalized patients. A web-based intervention was deployed as part of an existing order entry system at a university hospital on 5 February 2002. There were a total of 15 194 quinolone orders during the study period, of which 8962 (59%) were for oral forms. This model could be applied to other antibiotics or other drug classes with good oral bioavailability.</s><s>Inappropriate antibiotic use for pulmonary infiltrates is common in the intensive care unit (ICU). We sought to devise an approach that would minimize unnecessary antibiotic use, recognizing that a gold standard for the diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia does not exist. Diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia by bacteriologic analysis of bronchoscopic and nonbronchoscopic \"blind\" bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. 1991;143: 1121-1129) was used as operational criteria for decision-making regarding antibiotic therapy. In patients in whom CPIS remained </= 6 at the 3 d evaluation point, antibiotics were still continued in 96% (24 of 25) in the standard therapy group but in 0% (0 of 25) of the patients in the experimental therapy group (p = 0.0001). The operational criteria used, regardless of the precise definition of pneumonia, accurately identified patients with pulmonary infiltrates for whom monotherapy with a short course of antibiotics was appropriate.</s><s>To evaluate an intervention to reduce inappropriate use of key antibiotics with interrupted time series analysis. Use of Alert Antibiotics increased before the intervention started but decreased steadily for 2 years thereafter. The cost of development, dissemination and implementation of the intervention ( pound 20133) was well below the most conservative estimate of the reduction in cost ( pound 133296), which is the lower 95% CI of effect size assuming that cost would not have continued to increase without the intervention. Segmented regression analysis of pharmacy stock data is a simple, practical and robust method for measuring the impact of interventions to change prescribing. The Alert Antibiotic Monitoring intervention was associated with significant decreases in total use and cost in the 2 years after the programme was implemented.</s><s>Practice guidelines suggest that all patients hospitalised with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) should receive antibiotics within 4 h of admission. An experienced multidisciplinary steering group designed a management pathway to improve the early delivery of appropriate antibiotics to patients with CAP. Simple modelling from the results of a large observational study suggests that the cost per death prevented could be 3003 pound with no post-implementation evaluation, or 16,632 pound with a limited post-implementation evaluation. The intervention markedly improved door-to-antibiotic time, albeit at considerable cost. It might still be a cost-effective strategy, however, to reduce mortality in CAP. Uncertainty about the cost effectiveness of such interventions is likely to be resolved only by a well-designed, cluster randomised trial.</s><s>Widespread antibiotic use has been associated with increases in both bacterial resistance and nosocomial infection. To characterize the impact of hospital-wide clindamycin restriction on the incidence of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea and on antimicrobial prescribing practices. Clinical data on individual patients and data on antibiotic use were obtained from hospital pharmacy records. An outbreak of C. difficile-associated diarrhea was caused by a clonal isolate of clindamycin-resistant C. difficile and was associated with increased use of clindamycin. It can also lead to a return in clindamycin susceptibility among isolates and can effect cost savings to the hospital.</s><s>To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of a tailored multifaceted strategy, delivered by a national clinical effectiveness programme, to implement a guideline on induced abortion. All 26 hospital gynaecology units in Scotland providing induced abortion care. Following the identification of barriers to guideline implementation, intervention units received a package comprising audit and feedback, unit educational meetings, dissemination of structured case records and promotion of a patient information booklet.</s><s>The objective of the present study was to evaluate trends in antibiotic expenditure over an 11-year period (1982-1992) in a 370-bed district general hospital in Northern Ireland and to examine the impact of two separate antibiotic policies on antibiotic usage. A further objective was to examine the attitudes of prescribers to the second policy. Drug utilization review was used to collect information on antibiotic expenditure and usage before and after introduction of separate antibiotic policies in 1985 (not intensively monitored) and 1989 (intensively monitored).</s><s>Use of selected systemic antimicrobial agents at Boston City Hospital (BCH) has been monitored by requiring that choice of those agents be justified to a member of the Infectious Diseases Unit before the agent is dispensed for use in a patient. Whether these differences in usage led to better care for the patient could not be determined from the data presented.</s><s>Antibiotic misuse is common and costly and may promote antibiotic resistance. A randomized controlled trial was conducted in a large US teaching hospital. During an 18-week study period, 17 general medical, oncology, and cardiology services either received academic detailing or did not. In multivariable analyses controlling for baseline prescribing and study interval, the rate of unnecessary use of the 2 target antibiotics was reduced by 41% on the intervention services compared with controls (95% confidence interval, 44%-78%; P< .001). Targeted one-on-one education is a practical, effective, and safe method for reducing excessive broad-spectrum antibiotic use.</s><s>Our aim was to identify financial and outcome benefits of therapeutic intervention by a multidisciplinary antimicrobial treatment team composed of pharmacists, a clinical microbiologist, and an infectious disease specialist. The groups were similar with regard to severity of illness, infection type, and time from admission to randomization. Physicians received timely, detailed reviews of relevant microbiologic and clinical data with recommendations of possible optimal antibiotic choices, dosages, and rationales. Median length of stay after randomization for control and intervention groups was 9.0 days and 5.7 days, respectively (3.3-day difference, p=0.0001).</s><s>We examined the impact of a rational antibiotic prescription programme based on a multidisciplinary consultative approach in a 600-bed hospital. a restricted prescriptions policy for the most expensive antibiotics; (3.assessment of the prescription of these antibiotics by regular audits; and (4). Six audits, conducted since June 1997, show that the rate of unjustified prescriptions first fell significantly (from 6 to 0%, P<0.001), then increased significantly (from 0 to 3%, P<0.05) before stabilizing at 3%. The prevalence of MRSA and CRP remained stable, while that of EPESB fell significantly (P<0.001).</s><s>We studied the effect of a bayesian pharmacokinetic dosing program on the outcome of aminoglycoside therapy in patients with clinical infections. Patients were randomized to a control (dosing based on physician choice; n = 75) or experimental group (dosing based on the bayesian program; n = 72). Both groups used serum aminoglycoside concentration data when making dosing decisions. Mean length of total hospital stay was significantly longer for patients in the control group (20.3 days) compared with the experimental group (16.0 days) (p = 0.028). On the basis of a reduced length of stay, a potential cost savings of $1311 per patient can be achieved.</s><s>During the past decade, a variety of instrument-assisted bacterial identification and antimicrobial susceptibility test systems have been developed which permit provision of test results in a matter of hours rather than days, as has been the case with traditional overnight procedures. The intent of this study was to objectively define the clinical impact of rapid bacterial identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. In the overnight test group, these values were 19.6 and 25.9 h, respectively (P < 0.0005). There were 273 evaluable patients in the first group and 300 in the second group. Other than the length of time required to provide susceptibility and identification test results, no significant differences were noted between the two groups with respect to > 100 demographic descriptors. Similarly, statistically significantly fewer laboratory studies, imaging procedures, days of intubation, and days in an intensive or intermediate-care area were observed with patients in the rapid test group. Rapid testing was also associated with significantly shortened lengths of elapsed time prior to alterations in antimicrobial therapy.</s><s>The impact of changes in antibiotic policy on Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD), over a five-year period between 1995 and 2000, were studied in the Preston Acute Hospitals Trust. In 1996 the policy was changed in the Preston Acute Hospitals Trust from cefotaxime to ceftriaxone for initial treatment of severe sepsis or pneumonia in medical patients. A policy of restricted duration of ceftriaxone was introduced, and although this reduced usage by over 50%, CDAD continued at an average of 9.2 cases per month, despite withdrawal of oral cephalosporins in December 1998.</s><s>An analytical framework is suggested for the economic evaluation of policies to improve the management of hospital infection. Consideration of the costs and benefits to be expected from improved policies implies the existence of an optimal infection rate which is higher than the minimum attainable. It follows that hospitals can and probably do spend too much on infection control in, at least, some areas.</s><s>After noting a rise in vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) infections, we initiated a program to decrease inappropriate vancomycin use that focused on improvement of house staff prescribing practices. The initial intervention in June, 1995, encouraging house staff to follow hospital guidelines for vancomycin use and eliciting support from service chiefs in this effort, had little impact. A more intensive educational intervention, beginning in January, 1996, involved concurrent review of all vancomycin orders and one-on-one discussion with the house staff regarding the rationale for the order by an infectious diseases clinical pharmacist. When usage was deemed inappropriate, the pharmacist asked that vancomycin be discontinued, but no automatic stop orders were issued. This change was primarily due to a decrease in appropriate vancomycin prophylaxis by cardiothoracic surgery.</s><s>This study was designed to test whether rotation of antibiotics can reduce colonization with resistant Gram-negative bacilli in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Pharyngeal and rectal samples were obtained 3 times a week and tested for Gram-negative bacilli resistant to each of the rotation antibiotics. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis determined the numbers of genetically discordant resistant organisms on each team. The incidence of nosocomial infection and mortality also were similar across teams. These data indicate that rotation of parenteral antibiotics according to the applied protocol has no detectable effect in decreasing the reservoir of resistant Gram-negative bacilli in a tertiary-care NICU.</s><s>Toxin-producing Clostridium difficile is the commonest bacterial cause of nosocomial diarrhoea and is a well recognized cause of hospital outbreaks in elderly care units. A restrictive antibiotic policy that would maintain colonization resistance in the gastrointestinal tract was introduced throughout this unit. Patients admitted with suspected infection were prescribed intravenous (i.v.) trimethoprim 200 mg twice daily to cover urinary tract pathogens and Haemophilus influenzae. If the patient had septic shock a single iv dose of gentamicin was given (120-180 mg) to cover more resistant gram-negative bacilli. The number of cases of C. difficile toxin-positive diarrhoea; cefuroxime and total antibiotic use on the elderly care wards; patient mortality rates; and length of hospital stay: two hundred and fifty-two and 234 patients respectively with a discharge diagnosis of infection were admitted before and after the antibiotic policy change. Thirty-seven cases of C. difficile diarrhoea occurred in the period before and 16 in the period after the policy change.</s><s>A two-stage intervention was undertaken to extend the dosing interval of metronidazole--from the typically prescribed q6h or q8h regimen to a q12h dosing interval. Following an 2-week informational period, all prescriptions for parenteral metronidazole specifying a dosage interval of 8 hours or less were modified to 12-hour dosage intervals, unless overridden by the prescriber. Prescriptions for the 6-month periods prior to and following the intervention were reviewed to assess its impact on prescribing patterns and cost containment.</s><s>We previously reported decreased mortality following implementation of a community-acquired pneumonia guideline derived from specialty society recommendations. We utilized Utah data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid from 1993 to 2003 to determine if pneumonia guideline implementation was associated with 30-day all-cause mortality, length of hospital stay, and readmission rate. We adjusted outcomes by age, gender, Deyo comorbidity score, prior hospitalizations, and race. Guideline compliance was measured by initial default guideline antibiotic administration. We included patients > or = 66 years old with primary International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes 480.0-483.9, 485.0-486.9, 487.0, 507.0 or 518.81, and 038.x with secondary code pneumonia. Mortality OR at 16 Intermountain Healthcare hospitals was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.82 to 0.97; p = 0.007) compared with 19 other Utah hospitals. Improved clinical outcomes were associated with pneumonia guideline utilization.</s><s>To report the investigation and effective control of a nosocomial epidemic of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea. Patients who were positive for cytotoxin were compared with control patients without infection. Antimicrobial agent use from hospital pharmacy records and selected patient data from chart review were correlated with frequency of specific laboratory abnormalities. Restricting clindamycin use led to a prompt disease in infection rate and the type J7 organisms. A nosocomial epidemic of C. difficile diarrhea was controlled by analysis of antibiotic use patterns and by subsequent restriction of clindamycin.</s><s>To determine if local monitoring data on vancomycin use directed quality improvement and decreased vancomycin use or vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), we analyzed data from 50 intensive-care units (ICUs) at 20 U.S. hospitals reporting data on antimicrobial-resistant organisms and antimicrobial agent use. After data were adjusted for changes in prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, changes in specific prescriber practice at ICUs were associated with significant decreases in vancomycin use (mean decrease -48 defined daily doses per 1,000 patient days, p<0.001). In this study, practice changes focused towards specific ICUs were associated with decreases in ICU vancomycin use and VRE prevalence.</s><s>The impact of how positive blood culture results are reported on the evolution bloodstream infections (BSIs) has not been assessed. Overall, 297 episodes (109 in group A, 99 in group B, and 89 in group C) were studied. After receipt of microbiological reports, recommendations for changes in therapy were issued for patients in groups B (52.3%) and C (53.1%). For groups A, B, and C, the proportions of days on which adequate treatment was received were 66.3%, 92.1%, and 91.2% (P<.001); the mean numbers of defined daily doses of appropriate antibiotic therapy were 16.4, 22.2, and 20.7 (P=.003); the mean durations of hospital stay were 19.8, 23.6, and 24.1 days (P=.761); and the mortality rates during the late period were 12.9%, 15.6%, and 11% (P=.670), respectively.</s><s>We developed a pneumonia guideline at Intermountain Health Care that included admission decision support and recommendations for antibiotic timing and selection, based on the 1993 American Thoracic Society guideline. We included all immunocompetent patients > 65 years with community-acquired pneumonia from 1993 through 1997 in Utah; nursing home patients were excluded. Thirty-day mortality was 13.4% (1,037 of 7,719) among admitted patients and 6.3% (1,801 of 28,661) overall. For episodes that resulted in hospital admission after guideline implementation, 30-day mortality was 11.0% among patients treated by Intermountain Health Care-affiliated physicians compared with 14.2% for other Utah physicians.</s><s>To evaluate the impact of an interventional multidisciplinary antibiotic management program on expenditures for antibiotics and on the incidence of nosocomial infections caused by Clostridium difficile and antibiotic-resistant pathogens during 7 years. A multidisciplinary antibiotic management program to minimize the inappropriate use of third-generation cephalosporins was implemented in 1991. The program also appeared to have a favorable impact on VRE rates without a sustained impact on MRSA rates. These results suggest that an ongoing multidisciplinary antibiotic management program may have a sustained beneficial impact on both expenditures for antibiotics and the incidence of nosocomial infection by C. difficile and resistant bacterial pathogens.</s><s>Two hundred twenty-six patients with bacteremia were prospectively enrolled in a randomized trial that was performed to determine the clinical impact of the receipt of in vitro microbiological data by the physician soon after organism detection as opposed to having the physicians wait until similar data were available by routine methods. In both groups an infectious disease fellow used the information to make therapeutic recommendations to the responsible physician. When compared with that provided by the routine method, the information provided by the direct method was significantly more likely to result in an initiation of antibiotic therapy, a change to more effective therapy, or a change to less expensive therapy. Recommendations were significantly more likely to be followed in patients whose isolates were processed by the direct method versus the routine method.</s><s>To describe the epidemiology, antimicrobial susceptibility, and control of widespread ceftazidime-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae infections in a North American hospital and circumstances that led to delayed detection. PATIENTS AND CLINICAL ISOLATES: Patient records were reviewed retrospectively and prospectively. One hundred fifty-five patients were colonized or infected, representing more than 70 per 1000 average daily census. The outbreak coincided with increasing use of ceftazidime therapy for multiresistant Acinetobacter infections. Ceftriaxone, ceftizoxime, cefotaxime, and cephamycins were inhibitory, but not bactericidal, against ceftazidime-resistant Klebsiella and appeared effective by routine disc diffusion tests. Preliminary studies indicated that the outbreak was caused by one or more plasmid-mediated beta lactamases. Ineffective therapy, delayed detection of resistance, and epidemic spread are potential consequences.</s><s>Strictly enforced formulary restrictions for aminoglycosides, cephalosporins, and a vancomycin group generated combined savings of $2.61 (p less than 0.0046) per antibiotic day and $34,597 (p less than 0.0003) per month. Even after some cost increases (not significant) in new and other antibiotics, the program saved $1.33 (p less than 0.0175) per antibiotic day and $24,620 (p less than 0.0311) per month for all antibiotics.</s><s>Previous administration of third-generation cephalosporins predisposes to colonization and infections by multiresistant Enterobacter sp. To evaluate the efficacy of measures to control colonization and nosocomial infection by multiresistant bacteria in a neonatal unit. This study was conducted from October 1995 through December 1999 in 4 phases: a cross-sectional study, a longitudinal study with intervention measures, monthly cross-sectional studies, and determination of nosocomial infections caused by multiresistant bacteria (oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative bacteria resistant to either aminoglycosides or third-generation cephalosporins). Specimens for surveillance culture were obtained through umbilical and rectal swabs, and tracheal aspirates from intubated babies. Risk factors were analyzed through univariate and multivariate logistic regression. In the first phase, 32% (10/31) of the patients were colonized by multiresistant bacteria (29% by multiresistant E cloacae ).</s><s>Improving obstetric care in resource-limited countries is a major international health priority. Multidisciplinary teams in 2 hospitals used simple methods to improve their systems for prescribing and administering perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. Before improvement, prophylaxis was administered to 71% of women in hospital A; 24% received prophylaxis in a timely fashion. In hospital A, the surgical site infection rate decreased immediately after the improvements (P<.001). Simple quality improvement methods can be used to optimize obstetric services and improve outcomes of care in resource-limited settings.</s><s>A comprehensive program of clinical and administrative strategies to reduce expenditures for antimicrobial agents is described. A cornerstone of the program is the support for cost-reduction interventions offered by the pharmacy and therapeutics committee and its subcommittee on therapeutics; that support is demonstrated through endorsement and enforcement of pharmacy programs. Physicians are reminded of the cost-reduction programs through periodic articles in the pharmacy newsletter and an \"antibiogram\" card supplied by the division of epidemiology.</s><s>This study investigated the impact of a combined intervention strategy to improve antimicrobial prescribing at University Hospital Groningen. In a second phase, academic detailing (AD) was used to improve specific areas of low compliance with the guidelines. Materials and methods: Prescribing data were prospectively collected for 2869 patients receiving 7471 prescriptions for an antimicrobial for an infection covered by the guidelines between July 2001 and September 2003. The first intervention showed a significant change in the level of compliance of +15.5% (95% CI: 8%; 23%). AD did not lead to statistically significant additional changes in already high levels +12.5% (95% CI:-3%; 28%) of compliance. An 86% compliance level was achieved in this study without compulsory measures.</s><s>At EHS Christ Hospital and Medical Center, an eight-step process improvement model was developed that incorporates continuous quality improvement concepts for monitoring, evaluating and improving patient care. Nursing home residents admitted with pneumonia were identified as the group having the most influence on mortality and costs associated with treatment of pneumonia at our hospital. A multidisciplinary team evaluated clinical resource use and patient care processes, and identified root causes of various influencing treatment. The methodologic framework of a process improvement program combines epidemiologic, clinical, and quality improvement sciences.</s><s>Early diagnosis is difficult because initial clinical signs are nonspecific. Consequently, physicians frequently prescribe antibiotic treatment to newborn infants for fear of missing a life-threatening infection. A total of 1291 infants were randomly assigned to receive antibiotic therapy according to the guidelines of each center (standard group) or to receive antibiotic therapy when IL-8 was >70 pg/mL and/or CRP was >10 mg/L (IL-8 group). The primary outcome variables were 1) the number of infants treated with antibiotics and 2) the number of infants with infections missed at the initial evaluation.</s><s>A controlled cross-over study in 12 Victorian public hospitals was performed to examine the power of marketing techniques in influencing prescribing. The targeted prescribing behaviour was the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery, and the criteria for judging the appropriateness of therapy were its duration and timing, as are detailed in the fourth edition of the booklet Antibiotic guidelines. One year later, the intervention was mounted in the six hospitals that previously had been the control hospitals. The interventional campaign consisted of material that was similar to that which is used by the pharmaceutical industry, including an \"academic\" representative. The proportion of antibiotic courses that were assessed as satisfactory in terms of duration increased significantly after the first campaign in the hospitals where the intervention was mounted. We conclude that inappropriate prescribing behaviour in hospitals can be modified successfully by educational marketing techniques.</s><s>To compare two strategies for implementing guidelines for nursing home-acquired pneumonia (NHAP) and to measure outcomes associated with treatment in accordance with the guidelines. For the preintervention group (n = 226), 62.2% (79/127) of the episodes were treated with parenteral antibiotics (PA) when PA were recommended by the guidelines and 57.6% (57/99) of episodes were treated with oral antibiotics (OA) when OA were indicated by the guidelines. A preintervention significant difference in 30-day mortality observed between episodes with indications for PA (37.8% (48/127)) and episodes with indications for OA (6.1% (6/99)) (P < .001) was not present postintervention (11.5% (6/52); (23.8% (15/64); P = .06). The difference in PA use was not associated with significant differences in hospital admissions for episodes on NHAP. The addition of a practical severity of NHAP model or a change in reimbursement structure may enhance the guidelines' impact on hospitalization for NHAP. The financial benefits available with use of the guidelines will be limited unless the guidelines contribute to a reduction in rates of hospitalization.</s><s>New injectable antimicrobial agents are generally costly and broad-spectrum. This study aimed to evaluate the economic impact of a system using an antimicrobial order form to assist rational usage of expensive antimicrobial agents. The target drugs were 3 costly, broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs, namely imipenem, vancomycin, and injectable ciprofloxacin. The restriction of these 3 drugs was started in 1992 and was extended to netilmicin and ceftazidime in 1995. A filled antimicrobial order form (AOF) was required by pharmacists before dispensing the drugs. Feedback was given to the prescribers by infectious disease specialists at least twice a week. Impact of AOF without endorsement, audit and feedback, was evaluated in 1996. The expenditures of the drugs were adjusted to the average admitted patient-days per fiscal year of the study period. The system with endorsement was well accepted and could be maintained for 4 years. The system did not work with ceftazidime which was commonly used for febrile neutropenia and nosocomial infections.</s><s>To evaluate an antibiotic discontinuation policy for clinically suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Between April 2002 and July 2003, 290 patients completed the clinical trial. Hospital mortality (32.0% vs 37.1%, p = 0.357) and ICU length of stay (6.8 +/- 6.1 days vs 7.0 +/- 7.3 days, p = 0.798) were also statistically similar. The application of an antibiotic discontinuation policy for clinically suspected VAP was associated with a decrease in the overall duration of antibiotic treatment.</s><s>Lower respiratory tract infections are often treated with antibiotics without evidence of clinically relevant bacterial disease. Serum calcitonin precursor concentrations, including procalcitonin, are raised in bacterial infections. Primary endpoint was use of antibiotics and analysis was by intention to treat. Final diagnoses were pneumonia (n=87; 36%), acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (60; 25%), acute bronchitis (59; 24%), asthma (13; 5%), and other respiratory affections (24; 10%). Serological evidence of viral infection was recorded in 141 of 175 tested patients (81%). Bacterial cultures were positive from sputum in 51 (21%) and from blood in 16 (7%).</s><s>In patients with community-acquired pneumonia, guidelines recommend antibiotic treatment for 7 to 21 d. Procalcitonin is elevated in bacterial infections, and its dynamics have prognostic implications. To assess procalcitonin guidance for the initiation and duration of antibiotic therapy in community-acquired pneumonia. The control group (n = 151) received antibiotics according to usual practice. The primary endpoint was antibiotic use; secondary endpoints were measures of clinical, laboratory, and radiographic outcome. At baseline, both groups were similar regarding clinical, laboratory, and microbiology characteristics, and Pneumonia Severity Index. Procalcitonin guidance reduced total antibiotic exposure (relative risk, 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.48-0.55; p < 0.001), antibiotic prescriptions on admission (85 vs. 99%; p < 0.001), and antibiotic treatment duration (median, 5 vs. 12 d; p < 0.001) compared with patients treated according to guidelines.</s><s>The development and use of a hospital-pharmacy-based, computer-assisted antimicrobial monitoring program are described. In the pharmacy department of a teaching hospital in Spain, a manual system for collecting data on use of antimicrobial agents was replaced with a computer-assisted program that compiles data on culture and sensitivity results, the number of patients receiving antimicrobial or bacteriostatic agents (including combination therapy), and the specific agents used by hospital ward, clinical department, and physician. Antimicrobial use at this hospital is similar to that reported at other institutions. In 1984 penicillins were the most commonly used agents, followed by aminoglycosides and cephalosporins.</s><s>The effect of several drug restriction policies on benzodiazepine and cephalosporin use was evaluated in a large federal hospital. The five major types of drug restrictions implemented were the: (1) requirement that all diazepam prescriptions be countersigned by the chief of staff, (2) deletion of cephalothin sodium from the formulary, (3) required countersignature by a physician from the infectious disease service for all cefazolin sodium prescriptions, (4) requirement that justification accompany all cefazolin sodium prescriptions after the countersignature requirement was lifted, and (5) amendment of the countersignature requirement for diazepam with a series of designated exceptions. Formulary deletion, countersignature requirements, or restricted use to a service or physician are action plans that may alter the use rates of drugs.</s><s>We created a structured antibiotic order form designed to guide physicians toward correct therapeutic decisions without restricting their clinical options. The forms were supplemented with brief literature reviews and appropriate references. Before introduction of the form, pharmacokinetically incorrect orders for clindamycin, cefazolin sodium, and metronidazole hydrochloride accounted for 90%, 60%, and 75% of patient-days of therapy for these drugs, respectively. We conclude that in a period of increasing constraints on hospital budgets and proliferating restrictions on physicians' clinical choices, educational intervention at the time orders are written can provide a cost-effective and noncoercive means of improving some forms of acute-care clinical decision making.</s><s>Despite the publication of guidelines for the management of pneumonia, significant variation in care continues to exist. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that a project implemented by a quality improvement organization in small hospitals would lead to an improvement in care that could not be accounted for by secular trends in the management of pneumonia. Medicare-insured hospital admissions for pneumonia were reviewed from 20 small hospitals in Oklahoma (intervention group) at baseline and after feedback. Project intervention included onsite feedback presentations to the medical staff, samples of performance improvement materials, and comparative measures of performance of predefined quality indicators. These hospitals subsequently underwent an identical intervention with a follow-up assessment. Improvements in processes of care achieved by the intervention hospitals resulted from activities initiated because of participation in a quality improvement organization-directed project.</s><s>To evaluate the impact of a multifactorial intervention to improve the quality, efficiency, and patient understanding of care for community-acquired pneumonia. The average age was 71.4 years, and 44.1% of cases were low risk, 36.8% were moderate risk, and 19.2% were high risk. There was also a borderline decrease in the proportion of patients being discharged prior to becoming clinically stable, from 27.0 to 23.5% (p = 0.06). However, there were no improvements in the other targeted indicators, including time to first dose of antibiotics, proportion receiving antibiotics within 8 h, timely switch to oral antibiotics, timely discharge, length of stay, or patient education outcomes. Changing physician and organizational behavior in academic health centers will require the development and implementation of more intensive, system-oriented strategies.</s><s>The financial impact of using cefamandole and cefoxitin rather than cefazolin and of using ticarcillin rather than carbenicillin in one institution was assessed; the effectiveness of clinical pharmacists in reducing the costs associated with these drugs also was determined. If the indication for these orders was missing or considered inappropriate, the pharmacist contacted the prescriber and recommended substituting appropriate doses of cefazolin for cefamandole and cefoxitin and of carbenicillin for ticarcillin. The number of doses prepared and quarterly purchase data were collected as in Phase 1. The projected savings resulting from clinical pharmacist input relating to these drugs was calculated. Ticarcillin accounted for 77.1% of the total ticarcillin and carbenicillin doses in Phase 1, and 16.6% in Phase 2. A projected annual savings of $156,756 was achieved because of clinical pharmacist input at a cost of $16,000 for time devoted to the effort.</s><s>The effects on the quantity and quality of antimicrobial drug use of removing an antimicrobial restriction policy are reported. Data were obtained for nine restricted drugs and for three that were never restricted. Retrospective drug-use reviews were conducted for ceftazidime and imipenem-cilastatin. There were no significant changes in the number of courses of therapy or cost for the unrestricted antimicrobials.</s><s>The authors' hospital embarked on a three-component, multidisciplinary, hospital-based antimicrobial use program to cut costs and reduce inappropriate antimicrobial use. For the next two years, an antimicrobial use program was implemented consisting of three strategies: automatic therapeutic interchanges; antimicrobial restriction policies; and parenteral to oral conversion. Simultaneously, the average cost per dose per patient day dropped from $11.88 in 1991 to $10.16 in 1994. Overall, mean monthly acquisition cost savings rose from $6,810 in 1992 to $27,590 in 1994.</s><s>There is a considerable gap between randomized clinical trials and implementing the results into practice. Hospital pharmacists can be effective vehicles for bridging this gap and promoting evidence-based medicine. A total of 323 patients who were prescribed cefotaxime were randomized into an intervention or nonintervention group where only the former was challenged by pharmacists for inappropriate cefotaxime usage relative to hospital guidelines. Logistic regression analysis was then used to identify factors that were associated with successful clinical response. Overall, 94% of orders in the intervention group met cefotaxime dosage criteria compared with 86% in the control group (p = .018). However, several barriers to optimizing the impact of the pharmacist were implied by the data.</s><s>Appropriate antibiotic treatment decreases mortality, while superfluous treatment is associated with antibiotic resistance. We included patients suspected of harbouring bacterial infections in three hospitals (Israel, Germany and Italy). The primary outcome, appropriate antibiotic treatment, was assessed among patients with microbiologically documented infections (MDI). Among 1203 patients included in the cohort study (350 with MDI), TREAT prescribed appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment significantly more frequently than physicians (70% versus 57%, P < 0.001) using less broad-spectrum antibiotics at half physicians' antibiotic costs. Length of hospital stay, costs related to future resistance and total antibiotic costs were lower in intervention versus control wards. TREAT improved the rate of appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment while reducing antibiotic costs and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment.</s><s>This study sought to assess the impact of restricting use of vancomycin and third-generation cephalosporins on vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) prevalence. Changes in VRE prevalence after sequential restrictions on use of vancomycin and third-generation cephalosporins were evaluated. The correlation between antibiotic use and VRE prevalence was also investigated. Restricting the use of vancomycin and third-generations cephalosporins had little impact on VRE prevalence. The association between clindamycin use and the prevalence of VRE suggests that restriction of this and perhaps other antianaerobic agents might be an important component of future antimicrobial interventions.</s><s>The impact of attendance by infectious disease specialists (IDS) on hospitalised adults with community-acquired infection was assessed by studying 402 consecutive febrile adults who were admitted randomly to either of two internal medicine wards over a 4-month period and given intravenous antibiotics. In ward 1, patients were attended by IDS, whereas those in ward 2 were attended by physicians from other specialties. In total, 160 patients were treated in ward 1 and 242 in ward 2 (median age 66 years; 49% male). Ward 1 and 2 patients received 188 and 315 antibiotic courses, respectively, of which 32% and 20% required approval from IDS (p 0.003). Patients in ward 1 were more likely to receive ceftriaxone (7.5% vs. 2%; p 0.002), erythromycin (7% vs. 1.5%; p 0.002) and cefuroxime (48% vs. 26%; p < 0.0001), but were less likely to receive amoxycillin-clavulanate (8% vs. 28%; p < 0.0001). Regular attendance by IDS resulted in significantly higher rates of accurate diagnosis and appropriate therapy.</s><s>A multidisciplinary antibiotic review team (MART) was implemented to improve patient care and reduce antimicrobial expenditures. MART consists of pharmacists and infectious disease (ID) physicians reviewing patients three times weekly. ID physician or pharmacist offered recommendations and initiated order changes if the attending physician agreed. Annualized savings was $74,371, with 40% of the recommendations resulting in an improved antimicrobial therapy.</s><s>Shortening the turnaround time of microbiological procedures was associated with an improved clinical outcome in two studies performed in the USA. To study the clinical impact of a shortened turnaround time in a northwest European setting in which an automated system was used for bacterial identification and susceptibility testing, a single-blind, prospective, randomised controlled trial was conducted in a hospital in the Netherlands. All hospitalised patients with a bacterial infection confirmed by culture were randomly assigned to a control (conventional) group or an intervention (rapid) group. The turnaround time of the microbiological cycle using the Vitek 2 system as compared to conventional methods was studied and the clinical impact of a shortened turnaround time assessed in terms of mortality, morbidity, and cost. There was no significant difference between groups in any of the clinical impact variables. For the overall patient group in our hospital setting, however, this had no clinical impact.</s><s>To evaluate the effectiveness of an educational visit to help obstetricians and midwives select and use evidence from a Cochrane database containing 600 systematic reviews. Randomised single blind controlled trial with obstetric units allocated to an educational visit or control group. Rates varied greatly, but the overall baseline mean of 43% (986/2312) increased to 54% (1189/2196) 9 months later. Pooling rates from all 25 units, use of antibiotics in caesarean section and use of polyglycolic acid sutures increased significantly over the period, but use of steroids in preterm delivery was unchanged. Labour ward guidelines seldom agreed with evidence at baseline; this hardly improved after visits. Our educational visits added little to this, despite the informal setting, targeting of senior staff from two disciplines, and donation of educational materials. Further work is needed to define cost effective methods to enhance the uptake of evidence from systematic reviews and to clarify leadership and roles of senior obstetric staff in implementing the evidence.</s><s>A high proportion of medical in-patients in the UK receive intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy. Six months later, data were collected for a further 4 weeks following a second intervention (group 3). Interventions consisted of pharmacy-led implementation of guidelines incorporating criteria for IV therapy and switching to the oral route. The second intervention also included pharmacy-initiated feedback on prescribing. In groups 2 and 3, oral switch timing was appropriate in 90% and 88%, vs. 17% in group 1 (p < 0.001). Between groups 1 and 2, median duration of IV therapy was reduced from 3 to 2 days (p = 0.01). Pharmacy-led introduction of antibiotic guidelines appears to result in clinically appropriate reductions in IV therapy.</s><s>To achieve sustained improvement in use of cefotaxime and ceftriaxone (CEFX) in a major teaching hospital, as measured against national antibiotic guidelines. Pre- and post-intervention survey of CEFX use in the Royal Melbourne Hospital, a tertiary hospital in Melbourne, Victoria. Web-based antimicrobial approval system linked to national antibiotic guidelines was developed by a multidisciplinary team and implemented in March 2001. CEFX use decreased from a mean of 38.3 DDDs/1000 bed days pre-intervention to 15.9, 18.7 and 21.2 DDDs/1000 bed days at 1, 4 and 15 months post-intervention. The web-based antimicrobial approval system achieved a sustained reduction in CEFX use over 15 months as well as increased prescribing concordance with antibiotic guidelines.</s><s>To test whether a ceftazidime restriction policy in a pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) could decrease the endemic rate of colonization with ceftazidime-resistant gram-negative bacilli. After an observation period in which antibiotic use was not controlled, ceftazidime was prohibited unless the patient's microbiological results indicated that the drug was necessary for cure. However, there was a more substantial decrease in the proportion of ceftazidime-resistant organisms derived from species known to harbor derepressible amp C beta-lactamases (68.2% vs. 45.9%, p < .05).</s><s>Guidelines and clinical Cupertino for rational antibiotic use were implemented in a Norwegian paediatric department in 1994. Eight point prevalence studies showed that on average 23% (range 21-38%) of the patients were treated with antibiotics. Penicillins were used in 44% of courses, aminoglycosides in 35% of courses and cephalosporins in 9% of courses.</s><s>(GRE) had been established at approximately 50% in a series of prevalence studies on a busy haematological malignancy unit. In addition, an intense education programme was introduced to improve hygiene to reduce the risk of case-to-case spread. During the initial 4 months, at any time, 40-50% of patients in the unit were colonized with GRE, and 43 of 75 (57%) new patients initially negative for GRE acquired it within 6 weeks of their admission. A return to ceftazidime in Phase 3 was associated with a return of the risk of acquiring detectable GRE colonization, despite continued hygiene teaching and surveillance, with 21 out of 58 patients (36%) acquiring GRE (cohort 1 vs cohort 3: P = 0.08).</s><s>To implement and monitor the effectiveness of a strategy to curb unnecessary use of vancomycin and teicoplanin for inpatients in a teaching hospital/tertiary referral centre where 33% of S. aureus isolates (72% from ICU patients) were methicillin resistant. A sample of 182 vancomycin/teicoplanin inpatient prescriptions surveyed, revealed that only 31 (17%) conformed with Centre for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines. Following education (ward-rounds, bulletins) on appropriate CDC based guidelines for prescribing glycopeptides directed at relevant clinicians, 'Immediate Concurrent Feedback' (ICF) was gradually deployed throughout the hospital. This entailed review of respective inpatient records on the next working day. Each memo detailed the 'errant' incident, listed appropriate indications and explicitly advised desisting from such prescribing and suggested alternative therapy if necessary. Compared with baseline values, during 2 years of ICF, inpatient prescribing of vancomycin and teicoplanin deemed to conform increased to 71% (773/1086); difference 54% (P < 0.0001, 95% CIs 47-62%).</s><s>Rapid diagnostic tests with a high sensitivity for lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) could lead to improved patient care and reduce unnecessary antibiotic use and associated costs. Diagnostic yields, feasibility, and costs of real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens in the routine diagnostic work-up for LRTI were determined. Real-time PCR results for patients in the intervention group were reported to the treating physician; results for patients in the control group were not made available. A total of 107 patients (mean age [+/- standard deviation], 63.6+/-16.3 years) were included, of whom 55 were allocated to the intervention group. Use of real-time PCR increased treatment and diagnostic costs with 318.17 per patient. Implementation of real-time PCR for the etiological diagnosis of LRTI increased the diagnostic yield considerably, but it did not reduce antibiotic use or costs.</s><s>Although numerous reports have described interventions designed to influence antibiotic utilization, to our knowledge none have been evaluated in a randomized study. Adult inpatients receiving 1 or more of 10 designated parenteral antibiotics for 3 or more days during a 3-month period were randomized to an intervention (n = 141) and a control (n = 111) group using an unblocked, computer-generated random number table. Obstetric patients and those seen in infectious disease consultation were excluded. The intervention group received antibiotic-related suggestions from a team consisting of an infectious disease fellow and a clinical pharmacist. Sixty-three (84%) of these suggestions were implemented; the majority involved changes in antibiotic choice, dosing regimen, or route of administration. Per patient antibiotic charges were nearly $400 less in the intervention group vs controls (P = .05). Almost all the savings were related to lower intravenous antibiotic charges. This is the first randomized study to evaluate whether antibiotic choices can be influenced in a cost-effective fashion without sacrificing patient safety.</s><s>To reduce antimicrobial drug costs associated with the administration of cefazolin, a two-stage therapeutic intervention--employing persuasive (informational) and power (therapeutic interchange) strategies--was initiated at this 1,000-bed major Canadian teaching hospital. The target of the intervention was to extend the dosage interval of cefazolin to q8h. During a 12-week preimplementation period, 32% of orders specified 8-hour dosage intervals.</s><s>The implementation, monitoring, and impact of a program to restrict vancomycin use are described. A vancomycin restriction program was implemented in February 1995 at an acute care teaching hospital after guidelines for vancomycin use were established by a multidisciplinary group. Pharmacists reviewed each vancomycin order, suggested alternative treatments when vancomycin use did not comply with the guidelines, and set duration limits for all orders.</s><s>Patients with pneumonia often remain hospitalized after they are stable clinically, and the duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy is a rate-limiting step for discharge. The purpose of this study was to determine whether implementation of an evidence-based guideline would reduce the duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy and length of stay for patients hospitalized with pneumonia. Within site, physician groups were assigned randomly to receive a practice guideline alone (control arm) or a practice guideline that was implemented using a multifaceted strategy (intervention arm). The effectiveness of guideline implementation was measured by the duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy and length of stay; differences in the rates of discontinuation and hospital discharge were assessed with proportional hazards models. Intravenous antibiotic therapy was discontinued somewhat more quickly in the intervention group (hazard ratio [HR] =1.23; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00 to 1.52; P = 0.06) than in the control group.</s><s>Prescribing antibiotics for perioperative prophylaxis in common surgical procedures presents an ideal target for educational intervention. Prior to the intervention, 95% of sections receiving prophylaxis were given cefoxitin and 3% were given cefazolin. After the intervention, these proportions were reversed, with the shift in use occurring immediately after the intervention (p less than .001). Savings from this change alone accounted for over $26,000 each year, or $47.36 per patient-day of prophylaxis. Lasting improvements in clinical practices may be brought about by means that are noncoercive, inexpensive and well-accepted by medical staff.</s><s>Reassessment of ongoing antibiotic therapy is an important step towards appropriate use of antibiotics. Patients hospitalized on the surgical and medical wards of a university hospital and treated with an intravenous antibiotic for 3-4 days were randomly allocated to either an intervention or control group. The primary outcome was the time elapsed from randomization until a first modification of the initial intravenous antibiotic therapy. The results suggest that a short questionnaire, easily adaptable to automatization, has the potential to foster reassessment of antibiotic therapy.</s><s>A University-based hospital in Bogotá, Colombia, developed and implemented an educational intervention to complement a new structured antibiotic order form. This intervention was performed after assessing the appropriateness of the observed antibiotic prescribing practices using a quasi-experimental study. An application of interrupted time series intervention analysis was conducted in three antibiotic groups (aminoglycosides, cephradine/cephalothin, and ceftazidime/cefotaxime) and their hospital weekly rate of incorrect prescriptions before and after the intervention.</s><s>Resistance to amikacin, gentamicin, and tobramycin was surveyed prospectively during controlled aminoglycoside usage in 14 hospitals. Following an initial baseline period (minimum, three months) during which gentamicin use predominated, gentamicin and tobramycin were placed on restrictive control, establishing amikacin as the aminoglycoside of general use (86 percent of total aminoglycoside usage). During an average of 35 months' restriction of gentamicin and tobramycin, significant reductions in gram-negative resistance to gentamicin (8.4 to 7.0 percent, p less than 0.001) and tobramycin (6.0 to 5.3 percent, p less than 0.01) were observed. These data were compared with data from a similar surveillance program at the 700-bed Minneapolis Veterans Administration Medical Center. Despite predominant amikacin use for a total of 38 months, amikacin resistance did not increase and actually decreased significantly (p less than 0.05) in the last 12 months.</s><s>Both vancomycin and third-generation cephalosporin use are believed to contribute to a rise in vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) infections. In 1998, the largest number of VRE infections in our hospital occurred in the trauma/burn intensive care unit (TBICU), accounting for nearly 20% of hospital infections. In an attempt to control the VRE infection rate, antibiotic protocols for prophylaxis, empiric, and definitive therapy were initiated during the final quarter of 1998 to minimize cephalosporin use by the introduction of piperacillin/tazobactam. These data were compared to those in the medical and surgical intensive care units. In contrast, cephalosporin use in the medical and surgical intensive care units remains significantly higher than in the TBICU, and neither unit has had a reduction in their VRE infection rates.</s><s>To assess the impact of an automated intraoperative alert to redose prophylactic antibiotics in prolonged cardiac operations. Randomization to an audible and visual reminder on the operating room computer console at 225 minutes after the administration of preoperative antibiotics (reminder group, n = 137) or control (n = 136). Redosing was formally declined for 19 of the 44 patients in the reminder group without redosing. The rate of surgical-site infection in the reminder group (5 of 137; 4%) was similar to that in the control group (8 of 136; 6%; P = .42), but significantly lower than that in the pre-study period (48 of 480; 10%; P = .02). The use of an automatic reminder system in the operating room improved compliance with guidelines on perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis.</s><s>The effect of a change in the first line antibiotic treatment in a neonatal unit was studied. A total of 238 neonates (G1), admitted between 1 January and 31 July 1989, and treated with gentamicin, were compared with 398 (G2) admitted between 1 August 1989 and 31 July 1990 who received amikacin, in the combination of ampicillin plus an aminoglycoside. The change in treatment had no effect on the incidence of nosocomial infections [19.7% (G1) vs. 16.3% (G2) RR = 1.21 (0.86-1.70)], but the proportion of patients with nosocomial infections caused by the E. cloacae decreased (6.3% vs. 2.0% RR 3.14 CI 1.35-7.28). Certain trends in the bacterial ecology emerged: E. aerogenes and Enterococci increased in G2. It also highlights the need for epidemiologic surveillance, and poses the question of how best to modify antibiotic policy.</s><s>To evaluate a program to discontinue intravenous antibiotics at two teaching hospitals, 102 inpatients meeting eligibility criteria were randomly assigned to two groups. The intervention significantly reduced mean antibiotic costs per patient ($19.82 vs $35.84, p = 0.03), but related labor costs exceeded this benefit. Institutions considering such programs or with one in place should conduct similar evaluations.</s><s>We investigated the possible association between fluoroquinolone use and the rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) recovery from consecutive hospitalized patients. Three university hospitals were used as controls because they had similar preintervention rates of MRSA. During the intervention period (2001), the annual rate of fluoroquinolone use decreased from 54 to 5 defined daily doses per 1000 patients per day at Caen Hospital and remained stable in the control hospitals. This quasi experimental study confirms the association between fluoroquinolone use and MRSA isolation among hospitalized patients.</s><s>In 1995, changes in our hospital formulary were made to limit an outbreak of vancomycin-resistant enterococci and resulted in decreased usage of cephalosporins, imipenem, clindamycin, and vancomycin and increased usage of beta-lactam/beta-lactamase-inhibitor antibiotics. In this report, the effect of this formulary change on other resistant pathogens is described. Following the formulary change, there was a reduction in the monthly number (mean +/- SD) of patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (from 21.9 +/- 8.1 to 17.2 +/- 7.2 patients/1,000 discharges; P = .03) and ceftazidime-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (from 8.6 +/- 4.3 to 5.7 +/- 4.0 patients/1,000 discharges; P = .02). However, close surveillance is needed to detect the emergence of other resistant pathogens.</s><s>Vancomycin-resistant enterococci represent an increasingly important cause of nosocomial infections. Randomized controlled trial assessing frequency and duration of vancomycin therapy by physicians. Three hundred ninety-six physicians and 1,798 patients in a tertiary-care teaching hospital. Computer screen displaying, at the time of physician order entry, an adaptation of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for appropriate vancomycin use. Analysis of pharmacy data confirmed a decrease in the overall hospital use of intravenous vancomycin during the study period. Computerized guidelines represent a promising tool for changing prescribing practices.</s><s>An observational study on the epidemiology of multiresistant Enterobacteriaceae was conducted in the neurology and neurosurgery wards of a university hospital to determine the impact of hospital hygiene measures and an additional temporary restrictive antibiotic agent policy on the sudden rise in incidence of these bacteria. The incidence and prevalence of patients with multiresistant Enterobacteriaceae were assessed, and patient isolates were typed phenotypically and by random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis. The isolates recovered from the other patients comprised eight different species, and subsequent genotyping yielded a great variety of strains. The increased incidence could not be controlled with hospital hygiene measures alone.</s>"

Preterm birth rates were 19% lower among the experimental high-risk patients (7.4% vs 9.1%), and differences were significant (p < 0.05) when preterm risk was taken into account. There was no evidence to suggest that the secondary interventions provided added benefit over the primary intervention protocol of preterm birth prevention education and increased visits. The 19% reduction in preterm birth rate observed in the experimental clinics suggest an overall program benefit from a protocol that offered education, more frequent visits, and greater attention given to patients while the selected interventions were applied.</s>"

Report of the International study of Kidney Disease in Children.</s><s>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study to determine whether tuna fish oil decreased hyperlipidemia and proteinuria in children with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome. Small sample size, low dosage, short duration of supplementation and wash-out period are among the important limitations in this study.</s><s>There is no generally accepted treatment for primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Steroids alone and steroids plus cyclophosphamide can be expected to induce a remission of the proteinuria in only 27% of patients. Probably the majority of FSGS patients will reach ESRD over the extended course of their disease. In addition to the work presented in this study, there have been many reports of the potential effectiveness of cyclosporine (CSA) on reducing the proteinuria of FSGS. Proteinuria was significantly reduced from 151.7 +/- 162.4 mg/kg per 24 h at Week 0 to 36.9 +/- 42.3 at the end of the study in the group that received CSA (P < 0.05). A significant correlation between the percentage change of proteinuria over the 6 months of the study and the prestudy serum cholesterol levels (r = 0.79, P < 0.05) was seen in the CSA group. In conclusion, CSA reduces proteinuria, increases serum albumin levels, and can be expected, therefore, to reduce the symptoms of nephrotic syndrome.</s><s>First line immunosuppressive treatment in steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome in children is still open to discussion. Patients in the CSA group (n = 15) were initially treated with 150 mg/m(2) CSA orally to achieve trough levels of 120-180 ng/ml, while patients in the CPH group (n = 17) received CPH pulses (500 mg/m(2) per month intravenous). Given these results, the study was stopped, in accordance with the protocol. Partial remission was achieved by seven of the 15 (46%) CSA and two of the 15 (11%) CPH patients (p <0.05). Five patients in the CSA group and 14 patients in the CPH group were withdrawn from the study, most of them during the non-responder protocol.</s><s>The treatment of steroid-resistant minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS) continues to pose a therapeutic challenge. We conducted a randomised prospective controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of i.v. cyclophosphamide achieved remission; this was sustained in 4 patients, while 3 relapsed. Of the 6 patients who received oral cyclophosphamide, 2 dropped out, 1 responded and 3 children continued to remain steroid resistant.</s><s>We have conducted a controlled trial on the efficacy of cyclosporine in eight patients with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (four with idiopathic minimal lesion nephrotic syndrome and four with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis). Patients were randomly allocated to a cyclosporine (5 mg/kg/d) or a control group. Before the initiation of treatment, there was no difference between the groups with regard to proteinuria and serum albumin levels. This study does not support the use of cyclosporine at the dose of 5 mg/kg/d in patients with steroid-resistant minimal lesion nephrotic syndrome or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.</s><s>We aimed to test if fosinopril reduces urinary protein excretion and alleviates renal tubular damage in normotensive children with steroid-resistant idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (SRINS). Forty-five normotensive patients with SRINS were randomly divided into two groups. Group I was treated with fosinopril and prednisone for 12 weeks, while group II was treated with prednisone alone for the same duration. Patients in group I showed lower serum concentrations of urinary retinol-binding protein and beta(2)-microglobulin (P<0.01) at the end of the study, but the patients' blood pressure and components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) had no change during treatment.</s><s>Irreversible renal failure after indomethacin in steroid-resistant nephrosis.</s><s>Controlled trial of azathioprine in children with nephrotic syndrome. A report for the international study of kidney disease in children.</s><s>We have examined, in a randomized crossover trial, the antiproteinuric effect of treatment with low- (0.2 mg/kg daily) and high-dose (0.6 mg/kg daily) enalapril in 25 consecutive patients with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS). Those in group B ( n=14) initially received enalapril at high and then low doses. Patients continued to receive treatment with tapering doses of prednisolone; none received concomitant therapy with daily oral or intravenous steroids, alkylating agents, cyclosporine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and other antihypertensive medications. Baseline clinical, biochemical, and histological features were comparable in the two groups. In the first phase, treatment with low-dose enalapril (group A) resulted in median 34.8% Ua/Uc reduction compared with 62.9% with high doses (group B) ( P<0.01). High-dose enalapril was associated with a significant reduction in Ua/Uc ratio in both groups. Prolonged treatment with enalapril thus resulted in a dose-related reduction in nephrotic-range proteinuria.</s><s>Sixty children, with biopsy diagnosed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and with unremitting nephrotic syndrome despite intensive therapy with adrenocortical steroids, were randomly allocated into a clinical trial comparing prednisone, 40 mg/m2 on alternate days for a period of 12 months (control group), with the same prednisone regimen plus a 90-day course of daily cyclophosphamide, 2.5 mg/kg in a single morning dose (experimental group). One-quarter of the children in each group had complete resolution of proteinuria. The proportions of children with increased, unchanged, and decreased proteinuria by the end of the study were the same in the two groups. Five patients died during the trial, 3 in the experimental group and 2 in the control group.</s><s>To examine whether tacrolimus is more effective and safe than cyclosporine (CsA) in inducing remission in patients with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS). Tertiary-care hospital; 41 consecutive patients with idiopathic SRNS, estimated glomerular filtration rate greater than 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2), and histological characteristics showing minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, or mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis were randomly assigned to treatment with tacrolimus (n = 21) or CsA (n = 20). Tacrolimus (0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg/d) or CsA (5 to 6 mg/kg/d) for 1 year; cotreatment with alternate-day prednisolone and enalapril. Patients achieving complete remission (urinary protein-creatinine ratio < 0.2 g/g and serum albumin > or = 2.5 g/dL) or partial remission (urinary protein-creatinine ratio, 0.2 to 2 g/g, and serum albumin > or =2.5 g/dL) at 6 and 12 months; time to remission; proportion with relapses; side effects. The proportion of patients who experienced relapse was significantly greater in those receiving CsA compared with tacrolimus (RR, 4.5; 95% CI, 1.1 to 18.2; P = 0.01). Persistent nephrotoxicity necessitating stoppage of medicine was seen in 4.7% and 10% patients, respectively. Therapy with tacrolimus is a promising alternative to CsA in view of the lower risk of relapses and lack of cosmetic side effects.</s><s>To compare the efficacy (induction of remission) and safety of cyclosporine (CsA) with those of supportive therapy in patients with steroid-resistant idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS), we organized an open, prospective, randomized, multicentric, controlled study for parallel groups, stratified for adults and children. Forty-five patients with steroid-resistant INS were randomly assigned to supportive therapy or CsA (5 mg/kg/day for adults, 6 mg/kg/day for children) for six months, then tapered off by 25% every two months until complete discontinuation. At month 6 the mean urinary protein excretion, the mean serum proteins and plasma cholesterol had significantly improved in the CsA group but were not changed in the controls. The CsA-related side-effects were mild; no significant difference in blood pressure between the two groups was seen at any time.</s><s>We compared, in a randomized controlled trial, the efficacy of a regimen based on intravenous (i.v.) dexamethasone and oral cyclophosphamide therapy in inducing remission in patients with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS). injection of cyclophosphamide once a month for 6 months and prednisolone on alternate days. Data from 49 patients (26 in group I, 23 in group II) were analyzed; their clinical and biochemical features were similar at inclusion. Chief adverse effects, including cushingoid features and serious infections, were similar in both groups. In patients with SRNS, the efficacy of treatment intravenously with cyclophosphamide and orally with prednisolone was similar to the combination of dexamethasone intravenously, orally administered cyclophosphamide and prednisolone.</s>"

Patients were also asked to subjectively comment on changes in the amount of pain and on changes in the activities of daily living (ADL).</s><s>Results from a dose-ranging study in a selected group of de novo patients with rotational cervical dystonia (CD) suggest that 500 units of Dysport (Clostridium botulinum toxin type A haemaglutinin complex) is the optimal starting dose. The present study aimed to confirm the efficacy and safety profile of this dose in a population of CD patients more representative of those seen in a typical dystonia clinic. Treatment was administered according to the clinical pattern of head deviation, using a standardised injection protocol. Patients defined as non-responders at week 4 were re-treated in an open phase with 500 units of Dysport at week 6, and were followed up at week 10. Significant between-group differences in Tsui scores were present at weeks 4 (p=0.001) and 8 (p=0.002). Open phase treatment produced improvements in Tsui (p < 0.001) and pain scores (p=0.011), and 23/24 patients were classified as responders.</s><s>We studied the effect of botulinum toxin injection in 30 patients with torticollis in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Clinical improvement was assessed by a rating scale and by patient self-evaluation. The use of larger doses and injection of additional muscles may be necessary to achieve increased efficacy of botulinum toxin in the treatment of torticollis.</s><s>We used turns-amplitude analysis of the EMG as a guidance for botulinum toxin (BT) treatment in 19 patients with cervical dystonia. At the first examination, muscles showing abnormal activity (> 100 turns/sec at rest) were given BT 75 units (10 patients) or placebo (9 patients). Six weeks after the first BT treatment the sternocleidomastoid muscle contralateral to the involuntary head rotation and the ipsilateral and contralateral posterior neck muscles (PNM) showed a reduction of involuntary activity, as indicated by reduced turns/sec and mean amplitude at rest. This may reflect a functional random loss of muscle fibres, combined with inability to activate all motor units.</s><s>A double blind placebo controlled crossover trial was performed of botulinum toxin \"A\" in 20 patients with spasmodic torticollis. After a follow up period of one year, 16 still seemed to benefit from repeated toxin injections.</s><s>Botulinum toxin A was administered to 19 patients in a double-blind placebo controlled trial. Toxin was more effective than placebo for improving both head position and pain which was measured by an objective rating scale and videofilm assessments. A total of 60 patients with torticollis received toxin in a total of 117 treatment periods. Some improvement in neck posture occurred in 83% of the treatment periods with a mean duration of 12 weeks.</s><s>We enrolled 55 patients in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design study of the effectiveness of botulinum toxin (Botox) injections for the treatment of spasmodic torticollis. Compared with placebo, Botox produced statistically significant improvement in the severity of torticollis, disability, pain, and degree of head turning.</s><s>Botulinum toxin injections were given to 23 patients with cervical dystonia in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. The remaining 18 patients completed the study and showed a significant improvement after the injections of botulinum toxin in comparison with that of the placebo. The effect started about 1 week after injection and the maximal effect lasted about 11 weeks in patients with a satisfactory response. Thus, botulinum toxin injection is effective in treating cervical dystonias; injection of a higher dose of botulinum toxin in a greater number of neck muscles is required for those patients with complex cervical dystonia.</s>"

To compare the effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (ramipril), a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (amlodipine), and a beta-blocker (metoprolol) on hypertensive renal disease progression. Interim analysis of a randomized, double-blind, 3 x 2 factorial trial conducted in 1094 African Americans aged 18 to 70 years with hypertensive renal disease (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] of 20-65 mL/min per 1.73 m(2)) enrolled between February 1995 and September 1998. This report compares the ramipril and amlodipine groups following discontinuation of the amlodipine intervention in September 2000. However, compared with the amlodipine group, after adjustment for baseline covariates the ramipril group had a 38% reduced risk of clinical end points (95% CI, 13%-56%), a 36% slower mean decline in GFR after 3 months (P =.002), and less proteinuria (P<.001). Ramipril, compared with amlodipine, retards renal disease progression in patients with hypertensive renal disease and proteinuria and may offer benefit to patients without proteinuria.</s><s>ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists may favorably affect serum lipids and glucose metabolism. The primary aim of the Fosinopril Versus Amlodipine Cardiovascular Events Randomized Trial (FACET) was to compare the effects of fosinopril and amlodipine on serum lipids and diabetes control in NIDDM patients with hypertension. Prospectively defined cardiovascular events were assessed as secondary outcomes. Exclusion criteria included a history of coronary heart disease or stroke, serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dl, albuminuria > 40 micrograms/min, and use of lipid-lowering drugs, aspirin, or antihypertensive agents other than beta-blockers or diuretics.</s><s>The Verapamil in Hypertension and Atherosclerosis Study (VHAS) is a prospective randomized study the objective of which was to compare the long-term effects of verapamil and chlorthalidone on the blood pressure, clinical safety, and the progression/regression of carotid wall lesions in members of a large population of hypertensive patients. After a 3-week placebo run-in period, 1414 hypertensive patients [692 men and 722 women, aged 53.2 +/- 7 years, blood pressure 168.9 +/- 10.5/ 102.2 +/- 5.0 mmHg (means +/- SD)] were assigned randomly to be administered either 240 mg sustained-release verapamil (n = 707) or 25 mg chlorthalidone (n = 707) once a day for 2 years. The study design was double blind for the first 6 months and open thereafter. 25-50 mg/day captopril were added to the treatment of non-responding patients; subsequently, patients not responding to combined therapy were switched to any therapy chosen by the treating doctors (free therapy). The patients for whom we added captopril treatment constituted 22.6% of the verapamil and 26.2% of the chlorthalidone group; while 11.6 and 12.2% of patients in these groups, respectively, were administered free therapy. A decrease in heart rate (by 5.8%) occurred in members of the verapamil group only. Adverse events were reported by 32.5% of patients treated with verapamil and by 33.4% of those treated with chlorthalidone. In total 315 dropped out (153 from the verapamil and 162 from the chlorthalidone group). Similar antihypertensive efficacies, tolerabilities and cardiovascular event rates were observed with verapamil and with chlorthalidone.</s><s>Hypertensive patients are often given a calcium antagonist to reduce cardiovascular disease risk, but the benefit compared with other drug classes is controversial. To determine whether initial therapy with controlled-onset extended-release (COER) verapamil is equivalent to a physician's choice of atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide in preventing cardiovascular disease. Double-blind, randomized clinical trial conducted at 661 centers in 15 countries. After a mean of 3 years of follow-up, the sponsor closed the study before unblinding the results. Initially, 8241 participants received 180 mg of COER verapamil and 8361 received either 50 mg of atenolol or 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide. First occurrence of stroke, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular disease-related death. For fatal or nonfatal stroke, the HR was 1.15 (95% CI, 0.90-1.48); for fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, 0.82 (95% CI, 0.65-1.03); and for cardiovascular disease-related death, 1.09 (95% CI, 0.87-1.37). Nonstroke hemorrhage was more common with participants in the COER-verapamil group (n = 118) compared with the atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide group (n = 79) (HR, 1.54 [95% CI, 1.16-2.04]; P =.003). When considered in the context of other trials of calcium antagonists, these data indicate that the effectiveness of calcium-channel therapy in reducing cardiovascular disease is similar but not better than diuretic or beta-blocker treatment.</s><s>It is well established that hypertensive patients benefit from drug treatment of their disorder. In all these studies beta-blockers and/or diuretics were used in comparison with placebo. Newer therapeutic alternatives have, however, at least theoretically, many advantages which could result in further improvements in prognosis. The initial Swedish Trial in Old Patients with Hypertension (STOP-Hypertension 1) was conducted in men and women aged 70-84 years. Patients in primary health care (300 centres) will be included if their supine blood pressure is > or = 180/105 mmHg (and/or).</s><s>It has recently been reported that the use of calcium-channel blockers for hypertension may be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular complications. Using a multiple logistic-regression model with adjustment for cardiac risk factors, we found that nisoldipine was associated with a higher incidence of fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarctions (a total of 24) than enalapril (total, 4) (risk ratio, 9.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.7 to 33.8). In this population of patients with diabetes and hypertension, we found a significantly higher incidence of fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction among those assigned to therapy with the calcium-channel blocker nisoldipine than among those assigned to receive enalapril. Since our findings are based on a secondary end point, they will require confirmation.</s><s>Despite evidence of efficacy of antihypertensive agents in treating hypertensive patients, safety and efficacy of antihypertensive agents for coronary artery disease (CAD) have been discerned only from subgroup analyses in large trials. Patients were randomly assigned to either CAS (verapamil sustained release) or NCAS (atenolol). Trandolapril was also recommended for patients with heart failure, diabetes, or renal impairment. Primary: first occurrence of death (all cause), nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke; other: cardiovascular death, angina, adverse experiences, hospitalizations, and blood pressure control at 24 months. At 24 months, in the CAS group, 6391 patients (81.5%) were taking verapamil sustained release; 4934 (62.9%) were taking trandolapril; and 3430 (43.7%) were taking hydrochlorothiazide. After a follow-up of 61 835 patient-years (mean, 2.7 years per patient), 2269 patients had a primary outcome event with no statistically significant difference between treatment strategies (9.93% in CAS and 10.17% in NCAS; relative risk [RR], 0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90-1.06).</s><s>Most cardiovascular events associated with hypertension are complications of atherosclerosis. The European Lacidipine Study on Atherosclerosis (ELSA) was a randomized, double-blind trial in 2334 patients with hypertension that compared the effects of a 4-year treatment based on either lacidipine or atenolol on an index of carotid atherosclerosis, the mean of the maximum intima-media thicknesses (IMT) in far walls of common carotids and bifurcations (CBM(max)). This index has been shown by epidemiological studies to be predictive of cardiovascular events. The yearly IMT progression rate was 0.0145 mm/y in atenolol-treated and 0.0087 mm/y in lacidipine-treated patients (completers, 40% reduction; P=0.0073). Patients with plaque progression were significantly less common, and patients with plaque regression were significantly more common in the lacidipine group.</s><s>The Valsartan Antihypertensive Long-term Use Evaluation (VALUE) trial was designed to test the hypothesis that for the same blood-pressure control, valsartan would reduce cardiac morbidity and mortality more than amlodipine in hypertensive patients at high cardiovascular risk. The main outcome of cardiac disease did not differ between the treatment groups. Unequal reductions in blood pressure might account for differences between the groups in cause-specific outcomes. The findings emphasise the importance of prompt blood-pressure control in hypertensive patients at high cardiovascular risk.</s><s>The Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study (TOMHS) is a randomized, double-blind clinical trial currently being conducted to compare the effects of nonpharmacologic therapy alone with those of 1 of 5 active drug regimens combined with nonpharmacologic therapy, for long-term management of patients with mild hypertension. All participants received nutritional-hygienic advice to reduce weight and sodium and alcohol intakes and to increase physical activity. End points include blood pressure change, side effects and quality-of-life indices; incidence of electrocardiographic and echocardiographic abnormalities; and incidence of cardiovascular clinical events, including death, among participants receiving drugs as first-step treatment as well as nonpharmacologic treatment compared with incidence among those participants randomized to nonpharmacologic treatment only as the initial step.</s><s>Patients with diabetes have increased risk for adverse cardiovascular events. The primary outcomes of the Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial were doubling of serum creatinine levels, end-stage renal disease, and death from any cause. Randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with a median follow-up of 2.6 years. Time to cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, strokes, and coronary revascularization. The three groups were not statistically different in the composite of cardiovascular events. Likewise, patients receiving amlodipine had a significantly lower rate of myocardial infarction when compared with placebo recipients (hazard ratio, 0.58 [CI, 0.37 to 0.92]; P = 0.02).</s><s>Our aim was to compare the effect of lacidipine and chlorthalidone on cardiovascular outcome as a primary parameter and blood pressure as a secondary in elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension in a prospective study with an open design. Patients were recruited if sitting systolic blood pressure was > or = 160 mmHg with a diastolic blood pressure equal or lower than 95 mmHg. Primary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. At the end of treatment period (median 32 months), the reduction was 36.8/8.1 mmHg (systolic/diastolic) in the chlorthalidone and 38.4/7.9 mmHg in the lacidipine group, the final on treatment blood pressures being 142.0/79.2 and 143.2/79.5 mmHg, respectively. Similar reductions were obtained in a subgroup of patients (n = 209) followed in double-blind fashion for 1 year. The overall incidence of the primary endpoints was 9.3% with no significant between-group difference.</s><s>The apparent shortfall in prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) noted in early hypertension trials has been attributed to disadvantages of the diuretics and beta blockers used. For a given reduction in blood pressure, some suggested that newer agents would confer advantages over diuretics and beta blockers. Our aim, therefore, was to compare the effect on non-fatal myocardial infarction and fatal CHD of combinations of atenolol with a thiazide versus amlodipine with perindopril. The study was stopped prematurely after 5.5 years' median follow-up and accumulated in total 106 153 patient-years of observation. Though not significant, compared with the atenolol-based regimen, fewer individuals on the amlodipine-based regimen had a primary endpoint (429 vs 474; unadjusted HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.79-1.02, p=0.1052), fatal and non-fatal stroke (327 vs 422; 0.77, 0.66-0.89, p=0.0003), total cardiovascular events and procedures (1362 vs 1602; 0.84, 0.78-0.90, p<0.0001), and all-cause mortality (738 vs 820; 0.89, 0.81-0.99, p=0.025). Nevertheless, the results have implications with respect to optimum combinations of antihypertensive agents.</s><s>Are newer types of antihypertensive agents, which are currently more costly to purchase on average, as good or better than diuretics in reducing coronary heart disease incidence and progression? Will lowering LDL cholesterol in moderately hypercholesterolemic older individuals reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease and total mortality? ALLHAT is designed to determine whether the combined incidence of fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) and nonfatal myocardial infarction differs between persons randomized to diuretic (chlorthalidone) treatment and each of three alternative treatments--a calcium antagonist (amlodipine), an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (lisinopril), and an alpha-adrenergic blocker (doxazosin). For the lipid-lowering trial, participants must have an LDL cholesterol of 120 to 189 mg/dL (100 to 129 mg/dL for those with known CHD) and a triglyceride level below 350 mg/dL. Further features of the rationale, design, objectives, treatment program, and study organization of ALLHAT are described in this article.</s><s>The efficacy of antihypertensive drugs newer than diuretics and beta-blockers has not been established. We randomly assigned patients nifedipine 30 mg in a long-acting gastrointestinal-transport-system (GITS) formulation (n=3157), or co-amilozide (hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg [corrected] plus amiloride 2.5 mg; n=3164). Dose titration was by dose doubling, and addition of atenolol 25-50 mg or enalapril 5-10 mg. Overall mean blood pressure fell from 173/99 mm Hg (SD 14/8) to 138/82 mm Hg (12/7). There was an 8% excess of withdrawals from the nifedipine group because of peripheral oedema (725 vs 518, p<0.0001), but serious adverse events were more frequent in the co-amilozide group (880 vs 796, p=0.02). Nifedipine once daily and co-amilozide were equally effective in preventing overall cardiovascular or cerebrovascular complications. The choice of drug can be decided by tolerability and blood-pressure response rather than long-term safety or efficacy.</s><s>To compare the rate of progression of mean maximum intimal-medial thickness (IMT) in carotid arteries, using quantitative B-mode ultrasound imaging, during antihypertensive therapy with isradipine vs hydrochlorothiazide. Twice daily doses of isradipine (2.5-5.0 mg) or hydrochlorothiazide (12.5-25 mg). At 6 months, mean DBP decreased by 13.0 mm Hg in both groups, and mean SBP decreased by 19.5 mm Hg in hydrochlorothiazide and 16.0 mm Hg in isradipine (P=.002); the difference in SBP between the 2 groups persisted throughout the study but did not explain the increased incidence of vascular events in patients treated with isradipine. The increased incidence of vascular events in patients receiving isradipine compared with hydrochlorothiazide is of concern and should be studied further.</s><s>The effectiveness of diltiazem, a non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, in reducing cardiovascular morbidity or mortality is unclear. We compared the effects of diltiazem with that of diuretics, beta-blockers, or both on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients. The combined primary endpoint was fatal and non-fatal stroke, myocardial infarction, and other cardiovascular death. A primary endpoint occurred in 403 patients in the diltiazem group and in 400 in the diuretic and beta-blocker group (16.6 vs 16.2 events per 1000 patient-years; relative risk 1.00 [95% CI 0.87-1.15], p=0.97).</s>"

Seven very low birthweight infants who were being mechanically ventilated because of CLD were examined. They were enrolled in this study when their feeding volume exceeded 100 mL/kg per day. Each patient was kept on the same position (either prone or supine) during feeding. The tidal volume in the prone position was significantly larger than in the supine position only before feeding. Pulmonary resistance was not different in either position, but the static compliance and the work of breathing of spontaneous breaths were improved significantly when the infants were in the prone position.</s><s>Eighteen stable very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) mechanically ventilated infants with chronic lung disease were studied to examine the effects of right and left lateral positioning in contrast to supine positioning on transcutaneous (tc) oxygen (tcPO2) and carbon dioxide measurements (tcPCO2). Care givers are often reluctant to position infants in side lying, however, because of concerns that ventilation or oxygenation might be compromised. We conclude that placing the stable VLBW mechanically ventilated infant in a side-lying position has no deleterious effects on oxygenation and ventilation, as measured by tcPO2 and tcPCO2, and therefore should be encouraged.</s><s>To compare the effects of supine and prone positions on oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), desaturation episodes (SpO(2) < 90% and >or= 20 seconds), and motor activity in ventilated preterm infants during their first postnatal week. A stabilization period of 10 minutes before observation of each position was allowed. During the protocol, care procedures were kept minimal and ventilator settings remained unchanged. When prone, infants had higher SpO(2), fewer episodes of oxygen desaturation, and less motor activity than when supine. Seventy-four percent of desaturation episodes were associated with vigorous motor activity and crying. The prone position results in less motor activity and may stabilize oxygenation for ventilated preterm infants.</s><s>Sixteen stable intubated premature infants without a clinically significant patent ductus arteriosus were studied during recovery from respiratory distress syndrome in order to determine the effects of left and right lateral, as compared to supine, positioning.

After 2 days, the numbers of positive tracheal cultures in the supine group (67%) and in the lateral group (47%) showed no statistical difference.

        "Abstracts": "<s>To compare, in patients with hyperdynamic septic shock, the effects of norepinephrine or terlipressin on hemodynamic variables and renal function. Global hemodynamic variables, oxygen consumption, urine flow, creatinine clearance, and arterial blood lactate levels were measured. With terlipressin, but not with norepinephrine, a significant decrease in heart rate (from 113 +/- 17 to 104 +/- 11 beats.min(-1), p < .01) and cardiac index (from 5.1 +/- 1.7 to 4.2 +/- 1.6 L.min(-1).m(-2)) was observed, with no change in stroke volume. In patients with hyperdynamic septic shock, both norepinephrine and terlipressin were effective to raise mean arterial blood pressure. With terlipressin, but not norepinephrine, the improvement in blood pressure was achieved at the expense of cardiac index and oxygen consumption, which were significantly decreased.</s><s>Vasopressin has been proposed as a potent vasoactive agent in the treatment of vasodilatory shock in adults and children. The objective of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vasopressin as an adjunctive agent in pediatric vasodilatory shock. Vasoactive infusions were titrated to clinical endpoints of adequate perfusion. There was no significant difference in the primary outcome between the vasopressin and placebo groups (49.7 vs. 47.1 hours; P = 0.85). Low-dose vasopressin did not demonstrate any beneficial effects in this pediatric trial. Although not statistically significant, there was a concerning trend toward increased mortality.</s><s>Vasopressin is commonly used as an adjunct to catecholamines to support blood pressure in refractory septic shock, but its effect on mortality is unknown. In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial, we assigned patients who had septic shock and were receiving a minimum of 5 microg of norepinephrine per minute to receive either low-dose vasopressin (0.01 to 0.03 U per minute) or norepinephrine (5 to 15 microg per minute) in addition to open-label vasopressors. The primary end point was the mortality rate 28 days after the start of infusions. There was no significant difference between the vasopressin and norepinephrine groups in the 28-day mortality rate (35.4% and 39.3%, respectively; P=0.26) or in 90-day mortality (43.9% and 49.6%, respectively; P=0.11). There were no significant differences in the overall rates of serious adverse events (10.3% and 10.5%, respectively; P=1.00). (Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN94845869 [controlled-trials.com].).</s><s>To compare the effects of dopamine and norepinephrine on systemic and splanchnic oxygen utilization in patients with hyperdynamic sepsis. Twenty septic patients with a cardiac index greater than 3.2 L-min-1.m-2 and either a mean arterial pressure (MAP) less than 60 mm Hg or a systemic vascular resistance index less than 1200 dyne.s.cm-5.m-2. Dopamine increased the MAP largely by increasing the cardiac index whereas norepinephrine increased the MAP by increasing the systemic vascular resistance index while maintaining the cardiac index. Although oxygen delivery and oxygen consumption increased in both groups of patients, the pHi increased significantly in those patients treated with norepinephrine whereas the pHi decreased significantly in those patients receiving dopamine (P < .001, for corrected 3-hour value).</s><s>In septic shock, the alteration of the gut barrier contributes to the development of multiple organ failure. Epinephrine or norepinephrine were titrated (from 0.1 microg/kg per minute, with 0.2 microg/kg per minute increases every 5 minutes). There was no significant difference between groups regardless of the systemic and pulmonary hemodynamic or blood gas variable considered. In patients with septic shock, at doses that induced the same mean arterial pressure, epinephrine enhanced more gastric mucosal blood flow than the combination of dobutamine at 5 microg/kg per minute and norepinephrine.</s><s>Despite appropriate therapy, refractory hypotension often occurs in septic shock. A vasopressin infusion increased systolic arterial pressure (98 +/- 5 to 125 +/- 8 mm Hg, p < 0.008) because of peripheral vasoconstriction (systemic vascular resistance increased from 878 +/- 218 to 1,190 +/- 213 dynes/s per cm(-5) p < 0.05). Arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance were statistically unaffected in the placebo group. Before study termination, measured at 24 hours after drug initiation, two patients in the placebo group died of refractory hypotension. However, all patients receiving VP survived the 24-hour study period and had all other catecholamine pressors withdrawn and blood pressure maintained solely with a low-dose VP infusion.</s><s>Terlipressin, a precursor that is metabolized to lysine-vasopressin, has been proposed as a drug for treatment of intraoperative arterial hypotension refractory to ephedrine in patients who have received long-term treatment with renin-angiotensin system inhibitors. The authors compared the effectiveness of terlipressin and norepinephrine to correct hypotension in these patients. After randomization, they received either 1 mg intravenous terlipressin (n = 10) or norepinephrine infusion (n = 10). Beat-by-beat recordings of systolic arterial blood pressure and heart rate were stored on a computer. Terlipressin and norepinephrine corrected arterial hypotension in all cases.</s><s>Disturbances in microcirculatory homeostasis have been hypothesized to play a key role in the pathophysiology of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and vasopressor-associated ischemic skin lesions. The effects of a supplementary arginine vasopressin (AVP) infusion on microcirculation in vasodilatory shock and postoperative multiple organ dysfunction syndrome are unknown. Patients were randomly assigned to receive a combined infusion of AVP/norepinephrine or norepinephrine alone. Demographic and clinical data were recorded at study entry and after 1 hour. Patients receiving AVP/norepinephrine had a significantly higher mean arterial pressure (P = 0.047) and higher milrinone requirements (P = 0.025) than did the patients who received norepinephrine only at baseline. During the study period, there were no differences in either cutaneous reactive hyperaemia or the oscillatory pattern of vascular tone between groups.</s><s>International guidelines for management of septic shock recommend that dopamine or norepinephrine are preferable to epinephrine. This prospective, multicentre, randomised, double-blind study was done in 330 patients with septic shock admitted to one of 19 participating intensive care units in France. Participants were assigned to receive epinephrine (n=161) or norepinephrine plus dobutamine (n=169), which were titrated to maintain mean blood pressure at 70 mm Hg or more. There were no patients lost to follow-up; one patient withdrew consent after 3 days.</s><s>Terlipressin bolus infusion may reduce cardiac output and global oxygen supply. Prospective, randomized, controlled study performed in a university hospital intensive care unit. Septic shock patients requiring a continuous infusion of norepinephrine (0.9 microg kg(-1) min(-1)) to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) at 70 (sd 5) mm Hg were randomly allocated to be treated either with (i) sole norepinephrine infusion (control, n=20), (ii) a single dose of terlipressin 1 mg (n=19), or (iii) a single dose of terlipressin 1 mg followed by dobutamine infusion titrated to reverse the anticipated reduction in Svo2 (n=20). The terlipressin-linked decrease in Svo2 was reversed by dobutamine at a mean dose of 20 (8) microg kg(-1) min(-1) [Svo2 at 4 h: 59 (11)% vs 69 (12)%, P=0.028].</s><s>To compare the ability of dopamine and norepinephrine to reverse hemodynamic and metabolic abnormalities of human hyperdynamic septic shock. If hemodynamic and metabolic abnormalities were not corrected with the maximum dose of one drug, the other was added. With the use of dopamine 10 to 25 micrograms/kg/min, 5 of 16 patients (31 percent) were successfully treated, as compared with 15 of 16 patients (93 percent) by norepinephrine at a dose of 1.5 +/- 1.2 micrograms/kg/min (p < 0.001). At the doses tested, norepinephrine was found, in the present study, to be more effective and reliable than dopamine to reverse the abnormalities of hyperdynamic septic shock.</s><s>Both dopamine and norepinephrine are recommended as first-line vasopressor agents in the treatment of shock. There is a continuing controversy about whether one agent is superior to the other. The primary outcome was the rate of death at 28 days after randomization; secondary end points included the number of days without need for organ support and the occurrence of adverse events. The trial included 1679 patients, of whom 858 were assigned to dopamine and 821 to norepinephrine. There was no significant between-group difference in the rate of death at 28 days (52.5% in the dopamine group and 48.5% in the norepinephrine group; odds ratio with dopamine, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.97 to 1.42; P=0.10). Although there was no significant difference in the rate of death between patients with shock who were treated with dopamine as the first-line vasopressor agent and those who were treated with norepinephrine, the use of dopamine was associated with a greater number of adverse events.</s><s>To measure the blood flow distribution and regional oxygen transport in hyperdynamic septic shock during hypotension and after correction by vasopressor doses of dopamine or norepinephrine. Systemic and regional hemodynamics and oxygen transport were measured in ten patients with hyperdynamic septic shock during hypotension and after vasopressor therapy (norepinephrine or dopamine). Both dopamine and norepinephrine increased systemic blood flow and VO2 independently of the arterial lactate level. Despite the relatively small changes in systemic oxygen transport, major regional changes occurred in oxygen delivery and VO2, and these changes were unpredictable from systemic changes. The increased oxygen demand in the splanchnic region is the main risk factor for splanchnic tissue hypoxia in septic shock.</s><s>To determine whether there was a difference between epinephrine and norepinephrine in achieving a mean arterial pressure (MAP) goal in intensive care (ICU) patients. Patients with septic shock and acute circulatory failure were analysed separately. Blinded infusions of epinephrine or norepinephrine to achieve a MAP >or=70 mmHg for the duration of ICU admission. Two hundred and eighty patients were randomised to receive either epinephrine or norepinephrine. There was no difference in the time to achieve MAP goals in the subgroups of patients with severe sepsis (n = 158; RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.59-1.12; P = 0.18) or those with acute circulatory failure (n = 192; RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.62-1.27; P = 0.49) between epinephrine and norepinephrine.</s><s>Vasodilatory shock is a potentially lethal complication of severe disease in critically ill patients. Currently, catecholamines are the most widely used vasopressor agents to support blood pressure, but loss of catecholamine pressor effects is a well-known clinical dilemma. Arginine vasopressin (AVP) has recently been shown to be a potent vasopressor agent to stabilize cardiocirculatory function even in patients with catecholamine-resistant vasodilatory shock. Forty-eight patients with catecholamine-resistant vasodilatory shock were prospectively randomized to receive a combined infusion of AVP and norepinephrine (NE) or NE infusion alone. Mean arterial pressure, cardiac index, stroke volume index, and left ventricular stroke work index were significantly higher in AVP patients. Gastrointestinal perfusion as assessed by gastric tonometry was better preserved in AVP-treated patients.</s><s>This study was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) as the initial vasopressor in septic shock patients who were managed with a specific treatment protocol. If additional vasopressor support was needed to achieve the hemodynamic goal, then phenylephrine was added. Secondary end points included organ dysfunction, hospital and intensive care unit length of stay, and safety (primarily occurrence of arrhythmias). The 28-day mortality rate was 50% (67/134) with DA as the initial vasopressor compared with 43% (51/118) for NE treatment (P = 0.282). However, there were significantly more cardiac arrhythmias with DA treatment. Patients receiving DA should be monitored for the development of cardiac arrhythmias (NCT00604019).</s><s>To compare the effects of norepinephrine and dobutamine to epinephrine on hemodynamics, lactate metabolism, and gastric tonometric variables in hyperdynamic dopamine-resistant septic shock. These measurements were repeated after 1, 6, 12, and 24 h. All the patients fulfilled the therapeutic goals. No statistical difference was found between epinephrine and norepinephrine-dobutamine for systemic hemodynamic measurements. Gastric mucosal pH (pHi) decreased (from 7.29 +/- 0.11 to 7.16 +/- 0.07; p < 0.01) and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) gap (tonometer PCO2-arterial PCO2) increased (from 10 +/- 2.7 to 14 +/- 2.7 mmHg; p < 0.01) in the epinephrine group. The decrease in pHi and the increase in the lactate/pyruvate ratio in the epinephrine group was transient, since it returned to normal within 24 h.\n                Considering the global hemodynamic effects, epinephrine is as effective as norepinephrine-dobutamine. Nevertheless, gastric mucosal acidosis and global metabolic changes observed in epinephrine-treated patients are consistent with a markedly inadequate, although transient, splanchnic oxygen utilization.</s><s>To compare the effects of arginine-vasopressin (AVP) and norepinephrine (NE) on hemodynamic variables, organ dysfunction, and adverse events in early hyperdynamic septic shock. Twenty-three patients with early (12h) hyperdynamic septic shock in two teaching hospitals. Compared to baseline, AVP increased systemic vascular resistance, decreased exposure to NE, decreased cardiac output by decreasing heart rate, increased creatinine clearance, and improved SOFA score. One AVP patient developed acute coronary syndrome with dose-dependent ECG changes. In early hyperdynamic septic shock, the administration of high-dose AVP as a single agent fails to increase mean arterial pressure in the first hour but maintains it above 70mmHg in two-thirds of patients at 48h.</s><s>To evaluate the effect of terlipressin on oxygenation, PaO2/FIO2, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and mortality in children with septic shock refractory to high doses of dopamine/dobutamine and adrenaline. A randomized, nonblind study in the pediatric intensive care unit of a university hospital. We studied 58 children with septic shock and refractory hypotension despite fluid loading and high doses of catecholamines, randomly enrolled to terlipressin (TP, n=30) or control (n=28). TP was administered as intravenous bolus doses of 20 microg/kg every 6 h for a maximum of 96 h. Hemodynamic changes, PaO2/FIO2 rates, length of stay, and mortality rate in PICU were recorded prospectively. Terlipressin seems to cause no adverse effect but warrants further evaluation as a rescue therapy in refractory septic shock.</s><s>Recent clinical data suggest that early administration of vasopressin analogues may be advantageous compared to a last resort therapy. In all groups, open-label norepinephrine was added to achieve a mean arterial pressure between 65 and 75 mmHg, if necessary. There were no differences among groups in terms of systemic and regional hemodynamics. At the end of the 48-hour intervention period, bilirubin concentrations were higher in the vasopressin and norepinephrine groups as compared with the terlipressin group (2.3 +/- 2.8 and 2.8 +/- 2.5 vs. 0.9 +/- 0.3 mg.dL-1; each P < 0.05). A time-dependent decrease in platelet count was only observed in the terlipressin group (P < 0.001 48 hours vs. BL). The present study provides evidence that continuous infusion of low-dose terlipressin--when given as first-line vasopressor agent in septic shock--is effective in reversing sepsis-induced arterial hypotension and in reducing norepinephrine requirements.</s>"

This randomized controlled study compared the efficacy of an oral ceftibuten switch therapy with a ceftriaxone in both short-term and long-term outcomes. The subject characteristics and laboratory data were not different between the two groups. The use of oral therapy may result in a significant reduction of health care expenditure.</s><s>In this study we compared the efficacy and safety of isepamicin versus amikacin at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg i.v. Sixteen children were enrolled in the study; ten received isepamicin and six amikacin. Peak serum levels ranged from 9.05 to 30.70 mg/l (median: 16.165) and from 12.20 to 25.90 mg/l (median: 19.05) for isepamicin and amikacin, respectively.</s><s>To compare the prevalence of scarring following initial treatment with antibiotics administered intravenously for 10 or three days. Renal scarring developed in 33% of the 110 children in the 10 day intravenous group and 36% of the 110 children in the three day group. Children older than 1 year had more renal scarring than infants (42% (54/129) and 24% (22/91), respectively). During follow up, 15 children had recurrence of urinary infection with no significant difference between the two treatment groups. In children with acute pyelonephritis, initial intravenous treatment for 10 days, compared with three days, does not significantly reduce the development of renal scarring.</s><s>The efficacy and safety of netilmicin, 5 mg/kg of body weight once daily or 2 mg/kg thrice daily for 10 days, for the treatment of gram-negative pyelonephritis in children were compared in a prospective, randomized trial. Explicit criteria were used to define the site of infection, treatment outcome, and adverse effects. Netilmicin was given to 74 children once daily and to 70 children three times daily. At 1 week posttreatment, 73 (99%) of 74 children treated with netilmicin once daily and 70 (100%) of 70 children treated with netilmicin three times daily were cured. Ototoxicity, which was assessed by pure-tone audiometry (250 to 8,000 Hz) and brain stem-evoked response (6,000 Hz), occurred in 2 of 32 children who were evaluated. Thus, it may be possible to treat childhood pyelonephritis with netilmicin once daily.</s><s>235 infants and children were randomized to a 10-day and 42-day treatment group and followed-up for 12 months after their first urinary tract infection. The anatomical level of each symptomatic infection was determined using simple laboratory criteria. The two regimens prescribed were equally effective in eradicating the infection, but after the discontinuation of the 10-day treatment with sulfafurazole, 17 (23%) of 73 patients with their upper urinary tract infection experienced a recurrence within one month, as compared to only one (1) of 76 subjects in the 42-day therapy group. 10-day treatment may not be sufficient to prevent early recurrence of pyelonephritic infections in infants under 6 months of age.</s><s>Cefepime has been used in clinical therapeutic trials for meningitis, serious infection and febrile neutropenia, comprising more than 800 pediatric patients. In this study the safety and efficacy of cefepime were compared with those of ceftazidime for treatment of pyelonephritis in pediatric patients younger than 12 years of age. treatment was then to be continued or replaced by oral trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole for a maximum of 12 to 14 days. The predominant causative pathogens were Escherichia coli, 88%; Proteus spp., 6%; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 2%; and Klebsiella spp., 2%. Bacteriologic eradication was achieved in 96 and 94% of cefepime and ceftazidime patients, respectively, at the end of i.v. study drug treatment and was maintained in 94 and 91%, respectively, at the end of total study therapy. Drug-related clinical adverse events occurred in 14 cefepime patients (91%) and in 10 ceftazidime patients (7%).</s><s>The aim of this study was to compare, in children with acute pyelonephritis, the efficacy of 7 days' (group A) and 3 days' (group B) intravenous antibiotics, both followed by an oral treatment. Technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy was performed within the first days after admission and repeated 6 months later. Among the 92 children included in the study, 87 were followed for at least 6 months (43 in group A and 44 in group B) and were eligible for analysis. When the patients were stratified according to the delay of treatment, the percentage of patients with sequelae in group A was comparable, whether the delay was less or more than 1 week.</s>"

        "Abstracts": "<s>Prophylactic treatment of cytomegalovirus primary infection with ganciclovir in renal transplant recipients.</s><s>Posttransplantation cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection remains a significant cause of morbidity in kidney transplant recipients. Twenty-seven D+R-, 29 D+R+, and 23 D-R+ patients were randomized to receive 3 months of either oral acyclovir (800 mg q.i.d.) The D+R- patients were also given CMV immune globulin biweekly for 16 weeks. Surveillance blood cultures were obtained at transplantation, at months 1, 2, 3, and 6, and when clinically indicated. Both agents were well tolerated, and no drug interruptions for toxicity occurred. Symptomatic CMV disease occurred in 9 of 14 (64%) of the acyclovir patients, two with tissue-invasive disease.</s><s>Our objective in this study was to determine the efficacy of 2 grams a day of oral acyclovir administered for 16 weeks after transplantation for the prevention of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and disease in CMV-seropositive liver transplant recipients. The incidence of CMV disease was significantly lower in the acyclovir group (5%) than in the control group (27%; P < 0.05).</s><s>Treatment with prophylactic oral acyclovir, intravenous ganciclovir, or immunoglobulins to prevent cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and disease in renal transplantation is associated with variable efficacy and significant expense. PCR for CMV was performed on buffy-coat specimens every week for 15 weeks and at months 5 and 6. No patients in the ganciclovir group, compared with 14 of 23 patients (61%) in the deferred-therapy group (P<0.0001), developed CMV disease during the first 12 weeks. The time to disease was also delayed in the ganciclovir group compared with the deferred-therapy group (133+/-17 days vs. 51+/-7 days; P<0.0001).</s><s>Optimal prophylaxis against cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease for organ transplant patients at risk for primary infection (donor seropositive, recipient seronegative, D+R-) remains to be determined. We hypothesized that prolonged oral ganciclovir therapy following intravenous therapy would provide increased protection. Patients were assigned to their treatment groups at a central randomization site, with a separate randomization scheme for each of the organs transplanted (kidney, heart, or liver). In the case of kidney transplants, the patients were stratified according to source of the kidney (living related vs. cadaveric donor). The primary endpoint was the incidence of CMV disease in the first six months post-transplant. This difference was most marked in terms of tissue invasive disease: only 3 of 15 symptomatic patients in the ganciclovir group vs. 10 of 21 in the acyclovir group developed tissue-invasive infection (P<0.05). Prophylaxis with oral ganciclovir following a brief course of intravenous ganciclovir provides useful protection against primary CMV disease.</s><s>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most prevalent opportunistic infection after lung transplantation. To determine whether extending prophylaxis with oral valganciclovir from the standard 3 months to 12 months after lung transplantation is efficacious. Patients were randomly assigned by a central automated system to treatment or placebo. Secondary end points were CMV disease severity, CMV infection, acute rejection, opportunistic infections, ganciclovir resistance, and safety. CMV disease occurred in 32% of the short-course group versus 4% of the extended-course group (P < 0.001). Significant reductions were observed with CMV infection (64% vs. 10%; P < 0.001) and disease severity (110 000 vs. 3200 copies/mL, P = 0.009) with extended treatment.</s><s>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease is a frequent cause of serious morbidity after solid-organ transplantation. The prophylactic regimens used to prevent CMV infection and disease have shown limited benefit in seronegative recipients. Patients were assessed at specified times throughout the first 6 months after surgery for evidence of CMV infection, CMV disease, rejection, opportunistic infections, and possible drug toxicity. In the high-risk group of seronegative recipients (R-) of seropositive livers (D+), incidence of CMV disease was 11 (44.0%) of 25 in the placebo group, three (14.8%) of 21 in the ganciclovir group (p = 0.02). Significant benefit was also observed in those receiving antibodies to lymphocytes, where the incidence of CMV disease was 12 (32.9%) of 37 in the placebo group and two (4.6%) of 44 in the ganciclovir group (p = 0.002).</s><s>Cytomegalovirus is a major viral pathogen in patients who undergo renal transplantation, and cytomegalovirus disease is difficult to treat. Acyclovir was given orally in doses of 800 to 3200 mg per day, according to the patients' estimated level of renal function. Patients took the first dose of either acyclovir or placebo six hours before transplantation and continued to take the assigned medication for 12 weeks. During the first year after transplantation, 4 of 53 patients (7.5 percent) in the acyclovir group had symptomatic cytomegalovirus disease, as compared with 15 of 51 (29 percent) in the placebo group (P = 0.002). There was a single case of cytomegalovirus pneumonia in the acyclovir group, as compared with nine in the placebo group. There were no differences between the groups in the frequency of adverse events or in the rate of survival of either grafts or patients. We conclude that the oral administration of acyclovir, beginning before the transplantation of a renal allograft from a cadaver, reduces the rate of cytomegalovirus infection and disease without affecting the survival rate of either grafts or patients.</s><s>Unlike parenteral gancicovir, the efficacy of oral ganciclovir in the prevention and treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in kidney transplantation has not been well documented. This study prospectively evaluated the episodes of CMV infection within the first nine months after transplantation in renal transplant recipients treated prophylactically with oral ganciclovir (750 mg twice a day) over a period of 3 months (oral ganciclovir, N = 22), compared with patients randomly assigned as controls (controls, N = 22) who did not receive any anti-viral prophylaxis. Diagnosis of CMV infection at presentation included serological determination of CMV-specific immunoglobulin M antibodies, CMV immunofluorescence assay [standard culture tube and shell vial] (blood) and virus isolation (urine and tissue). Except for one, none of these patients developed CMV infection either before or after rejection(s).</s><s>Because of the immunosuppression required, heart-transplant recipients frequently have complications caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV), including pneumonia, esophagitis, gastritis, and a syndrome of fever, hepatitis, and leukopenia. We undertook a controlled trial to evaluate the prophylactic administration of ganciclovir to prevent CMV-induced disease after heart transplantation. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at four centers. Among the seropositive patients, CMV illness occurred during the first 120 days after heart transplantation in 26 of 56 patients given placebo (46 percent), as compared with 5 of 56 patients treated with ganciclovir (9 percent) (P less than 0.001). Among 37 seronegative patients, CMV illness was frequent in both groups (placebo, 29 percent; ganciclovir, 35 percent; P not significant). From day 15 through day 60, the patients who took ganciclovir had significantly fewer urine cultures positive for CMV, but by day 90 there was no difference.</s><s>The optimal prophylactic regimen to prevent cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and disease in orthotopic liver-transplant patients remains to be established. We tested whether a combination of intravenous ganciclovir (GCV) followed by high dosages of oral acyclovir (ACV) for 4 months provided a higher degree of protection from CMV than oral ACV alone. One hundred sixty-seven liver-transplant recipients were randomized to receive 120 days of antiviral treatment starting at the time of transplantation consisting of either ACV 800 mg orally four times daily (n=84) or 14 days of GCV 5 mg/kg intravenously every 12 hr followed by oral ACV 800 mg four times daily (n=83). During the first year after transplantation, CMV infection developed in 57% of patients treated with ACV and in 37% of patients treated with GCV + ACV (P=0.001). In seronegative recipients of allografts from CMV-seropositive donors (D+/R-), CMV disease developed in 58% of patients treated with ACV and in 25% of patients treated with GCV + ACV (P=0.04).</s><s>Antiviral prophylaxis against cytomegalovirus has been associated with reduced risk of allograft rejection and improved allograft survival after renal transplantation. This phenomenon might not be fully explained by preventing the indirect effects of cytomegalovirus. The effect of antiviral agents on lymphocyte function in patients treated with modern immunosuppression has not been studied to date. Adult renal transplant recipients were assigned to 3-month prophylaxis with either valganciclovir (900 mg once daily; n=19) or valacyclovir (2 g four times daily; n=17) as part of an ongoing randomized trial. Valganciclovir suppresses lymphocyte proliferation and activation in patients after renal transplantation.</s><s>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease is a major complication of organ transplantation. We hypothesized that prophylactic treatment with valacyclovir would reduce the risk of CMV disease. Among the seropositive patients, the respective values were 6 percent and 0 percent. At six months, the rate of biopsy-confirmed acute graft rejection in the seronegative group was 52 percent among placebo recipients and 26 percent among valacyclovir recipients (P=0.001). Treatment with valacyclovir also decreased the rates of CMV viremia and viruria, herpes simplex virus disease, and the use of inpatient medical resources. Prophylactic treatment with valacyclovir is a safe and effective way to prevent CMV disease after renal transplantation.</s><s>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is the most frequent infectious complication observed in renal-transplant recipients and induces a significant morbidity in these patients due to CMV disease itself and to associated renal dysfunction or opportunistic superinfection. In order to evaluate the effect of gangiclovir prophylaxis we conducted an open-label prospective randomized study of ganciclovir administration in CMV seronegative recipients of a renal allograft from CMV seropositive donors. Ganciclovir (5 mg/kg b.i.d./day for 14 days) was started on day 14 after transplantation. Thirty-two patients were included in this study (15 in the control group, 17 in the ganciclovir group). The rate of CMV infection and CMV disease were similar in both groups (80% and 73.3% in the control group versus 70.6% and 47.1% in the ganciclovir group; P = NS). Less severe CMV disease was observed in the ganciclovir group compared to controls.</s><s>The potential of prophylactic ganciclovir for the control of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection was evaluated in a prospective controlled trial of 65 patients after liver transplantation. A group of 33 patients received ganciclovir (10 mg/kg/day) during the third and fourth weeks after transplantation, while 32 patients were randomised to receive ganciclovir (10 mg/kg/day) only when clinical CMV disease was diagnosed. However, the frequency of clinical infections was similar in the two groups (9/33 vs. 11/32). Liver function tests during the second month after transplantation were not significantly better in the patients receiving prophylactic ganciclovir.</s><s>Cytomegalovirus (CMV)-seronegative liver transplant recipients with CMV-seropositive donors have the greatest risk for CMV disease. Patients then either received oral ganciclovir (1 g every 8 hr) or continued IV ganciclovir (6 mg/kg once per day on Monday-Friday of each week) from days 15 to 100 after transplantation. All cases of CMV disease occurred more than 90 days after transplantation (median time of onset day +137 for oral ganciclovir and day +135 for IV ganciclovir). These results indicate that, after induction with 14 days of IV ganciclovir, oral ganciclovir can be as effective as IV ganciclovir for long-term prophylaxis of CMV disease in high-risk CMV-seronegative liver transplant recipients with CMV-seropositive donors and eliminates the need for prolonged IV access.</s><s>Both oral ganciclovir and valacyclovir decrease the incidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease after renal transplantation. No differences were found in demography, immunosuppression, or donor/recipient CMV serology. The 12-month incidence of CMV disease was 67% in the DEF group compared with 6% in the GAN group and 3% in the VAL group (P<0.001 GAN or VAL vs. DEF; P=0.575 GAN vs. VAL). The average CMV-associated costs per patient were $3,072, $2,906, and $4,906 in the GAN, VAL, and DEF groups, respectively. Valacyclovir and oral ganciclovir are equally effective in the prevention of CMV disease after renal transplantation. Valacyclovir is associated with a significantly reduced risk of acute rejection compared with both ganciclovir prophylaxis and deferred therapy.</s><s>Despite current approaches to prophylaxis, cytomegalovirus (CMV) continues to be a common cause of infection and disease in solid-organ-transplant patients. Thus, we conducted a controlled trial comparing long-term administration of ganciclovir with high-dose acyclovir for prevention of CMV infection and disease in liver transplant recipients. Patients were followed for development of CMV infection, CMV disease, and drug-related toxicity by frequent cultures, serological tests, laboratory measurements, and tissue biopsies. During the first 120 days after transplant, CMV infection occurred in 48 of 126 (38%) acyclovir patients but in only 6 of 124 (5%) ganciclovir patients (p < 0.0001). In a multivariate analysis of donor-recipient CMV antibody status and other risk factors, prophylactic ganciclovir was the most significant factor protecting against CMV infection (p < 0.0001) and disease (p = 0.001). Incidences of leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, renal failure, and other adverse events were similar in the two groups.</s><s>Viral prophylaxis in hepatic transplantation: preliminary report of a randomized trial of acyclovir and gancyclovir.</s><s>In an attempt to modify the sequelae of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections after lung transplantation, 25 allograft recipients were randomized to either ganciclovir 5 mg/kg once a day 5 d/wk (Group G) or acyclovir 800 mg four times a day (Group A). All subjects received ganciclovir during postoperative Weeks 1 through 3, and they were then given either A or G regimens until Day 90. The short-term benefits of ganciclovir were ultimately limited, moreover, in that cumulative rates of CMV and prevalence of OB are now similar in both treatment groups after approximately 2 yr of observation. We conclude that prolonged ganciclovir prophylaxis decreases the early incidence of CMV and OB among lung transplant recipients, but these effects are of finite duration.</s><s>A randomized trial was performed to compare the sequential use of 2 weeks of intravenous ganciclovir (10 mg/[kg.d]) followed by 50 weeks of high-dose oral acyclovir (800 mg/m2 four times daily) with 2 weeks of intravenous ganciclovir alone as prophylaxis for cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) disease after pediatric liver transplantation. Similarly, the rate of CMV disease among high-risk patients (CMV-positive donor/CMV-negative recipient) treated with the combination regimen was higher than that among high-risk patients treated with ganciclovir alone (four [57%] of seven vs. zero of five, respectively; vs P < .05).</s><s>This study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of oral versus intravenous ganciclovir in high-risk kidney recipients. Thirty-four, cytomegalovirus (CMV) seropositive recipients of kidneys from seropositive donors who had undergone antilymphocytic immunosuppressive therapy were assigned randomly to oral (1000 mg, three times a day, 12 weeks) versus intravenous (5 mg/kg, 2 weeks) ganciclovir prophylaxis. The patients were evaluated for clinical and laboratory outcomes regarding CMV serostatus, CMV disease, graft outcome, and ganciclovir side effects. Sixteen patients in the oral group and 14 in the intravenous group completed the study. Only two patients in the intravenous group experienced CMV diseases, which were not tissue-invasive. The patients tolerated oral ganciclovir well; the compliance percent was 81.6%.</s><s>An open, prospective, randomised study was conducted to compare the safety and efficacy of valacyclovir vs. oral ganciclovir for cytomegalovirus (CMV) prophylaxis in renal transplant recipients. Both groups were similar in terms of demographics, primary renal disease, graft source, HLA matching, immunosuppressive therapy and donor-recipient CMV antibody status. CMV disease was observed in only one patient belonging to the ganciclovir group, who developed enterocolitis 6 months post-transplantation. An increased number of bacterial infections was noted in the ganciclovir group (p 0.003). The estimated cost of valacyclovir treatment was 20% higher than that of ganciclovir treatment. Decisions regarding prophylactic regimens should include additional criteria, such as cost or possible development of resistance.</s><s>Late-onset cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease is a significant problem with a standard 3-month prophylaxis regimen. Confirmed CMV viremia was also significantly lower in the 200-day group (37.4% vs. 50.9%; p = 0.015 at month 12). There was no significant difference in the rate of biopsy-proven acute rejection between the groups (11% vs. 17%, respectively, p = 0.114). Adverse events occurred at similar rates between the groups and the majority were rated mild-to-moderate in intensity and not related to study medication. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that extending valganciclovir prophylaxis (900 mg once daily) to 200 days significantly reduces the incidence of CMV disease and viremia through to 12 months compared with 100 days' prophylaxis, without significant additional safety concerns associated with longer treatment.</s><s>Recent studies showed contradictory results concerning the efficacy of oral acyclovir in the prevention or amelioration of cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease after renal transplantation (TX). This study evaluated the incidence and severity of CMV disease within the first year after TX in high-risk renal transplant recipients (CMV-seropositive donor, seronegative recipient) treated prophylactically with oral acyclovir (800 to 3200 mg/day) over a period of 12 wk (ACY, N = 22), compared with high-risk patients randomly assigned as controls (CO, N = 10). Severity of CMV disease was quantified by a scoring system for CMV-related symptoms. Our results show no beneficial effect of oral acyclovir prophylaxis in CMV high-risk renal transplant recipients.</s><s>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is still a major pathogen in liver transplantation (LTX). Fifty-five patients were enrolled in a prospective, randomised, double-blind and placebo-controlled trial; 28 on acyclovir vs. 27 on placebo. CMV infection was diagnosed in 60% (16 on acyclovir, 17 on placebo) and CMV disease developed in 38% (7 on acyclovir, 14 on placebo) of the patients. Adverse events included neurotoxicity which occurred in 5 cases in the acyclovir, but none in the placebo arm, and nephrotoxicity which was detected in 6 patients in the acyclovir and 5 in the placebo arm, respectively. We conclude that acyclovir prophylaxis significantly reduced the incidence of CMV disease, and delayed the onset of CMV infection in liver transplant patients.</s><s>The aim of this double-blind, placebo-controlled study was to determine whether a prolonged course of low-dose ganciclovir prevented the development of clinical cytomegalovirus disease after heart transplantation. Fifty-six consecutive patients were stratified into two groups: cytomegalovirus-positive recipients (n = 40) and cytomegalovirus-negative recipients of organs from cytomegalovirus-positive donors (n = 16). All patients received equine antithymocyte globulin induction for 7 days and maintenance doses of cyclosporine, azathioprine, and prednisolone. Ganciclovir prophylaxis reduced the actuarial incidence of cytomegalovirus disease from 71% to 11% in cytomegalovirus-mismatched patients (p < 0.01). Gastritis was the most common clinical manifestation of cytomegalovirus disease.</s><s>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a major cause of serious morbidity following solid organ transplantation via both direct and indirect mechanisms. Twenty-seven CMV seropositive adults due to receive a heart transplant were included in a single-center, randomized, double-blind study. Patients were randomized to receive either oral valacyclovir 2000 mg or oral acyclovir 200 mg four times daily starting within 3 days of heart transplant and continuing for 90 days. Other measures were time to asymptomatic CMV infection, symptomatic CMV infections, and end-organ CMV disease. Safety was assessed by evaluating changes in hematology and clinical chemistry parameters and by the occurrence of adverse events. There was also a trend for delayed acute rejection, and fewer opportunistic or other herpesvirus infections occurred in the valacyclovir group.</s><s>To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and cost of preemptive ganciclovir therapy in cytomegalovirus (CMV)-seropositive renal transplant recipients treated with antilymphocyte antibody (ALA) preparations. A prospective, randomized trial at a 650-bed tertiary medical center hospital. Forty consecutive CMV-seropositive renal allograft recipients who underwent transplantation between January 1992 and January 1994 and were treated with ALA for induction immunosuppression or acute rejection therapy. The incidence and severity of CMV disease, length of hospitalization, and patient and allograft survival. Preemptive ganciclovir therapy significantly reduced the incidence of CMV disease (P < .05) in CMV-seropositive renal transplant patients who were treated with ALA and was well tolerated.</s><s>Cytomegalovirus disease is an important cause of morbidity following liver transplantation. One hundred forty-three patients were randomized to receive either high dose oral acyclovir (800 mg 4 times a day) alone for 3 months after transplantation (acyclovir group) or intravenous ganciclovir (5 mg/kg twice a day) for 14 days followed by high dose oral acyclovir to complete a 3-month regimen (ganciclovir group). Of those randomized, CMV disease was seen in 20 (28%) of the acyclovir group compared with 6 (9%) of the ganciclovir group (relative risk, 5.11; 95% confidence interval, 2.05-12.75; P = 0.0001). With respect to primary CMV infection, there was no difference in the rates in the 2 groups, but tissue invasive disease and recurrent CMV disease were less frequent in the ganciclovir group. However, the lack of significant effect in seronegative recipients who received grafts from seropositive donors suggests that other strategies are needed to prevent CMV infection in this high risk population.</s><s>To determine whether preemptive ganciclovir therapy administered daily during antilymphocyte antibody therapy can prevent cytomegalovirus disease in renal transplant recipients who are positive for cytomegalovirus antibody. 113 renal transplant recipients who were positive for cytomegalovirus antibody. Patients were observed for 6 months after completion of antilymphocyte antibody therapy for development of cytomegalovirus disease and cytomegalovirus viremia. Cytomegalovirus disease occurred in 14% of patients (9 of 64) who received preemptive ganciclovir therapy and in 33% of controls (16 of 49) (P = 0.018). Controlling for the reason (induction or treatment of rejection) for using antilymphocyte antibodies in a Cox proportional hazards model, we found that preemptive ganciclovir still protected against cytomegalovirus disease (adjusted relative risk, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.64). Preemptive ganciclovir therapy administered daily during courses of treatment with antilymphocyte antibodies reduced the excessive occurrence of cytomegalovirus disease in renal transplant recipients who were positive for cytomegalovirus antibody.</s><s>Randomized controlled trial of acyclovir for the prevention of cytomegalovirus infection and disease in liver transplant recipients.</s><s>We compared the efficacy and safety of valganciclovir with those of oral ganciclovir in preventing cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease in high-risk seronegative solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients of organs from seropositive donors (D+/R-). In this randomised, prospective, double-blind, double-dummy study, 364 CMV D+/R- patients received valganciclovir 900 mg once daily or oral ganciclovir 1000 mg three times a day (tid) within 10 days of transplant and continued through 100 days. CMV disease, plasma viremia, acute graft rejection, graft loss and safety were analyzed up to 6 and 12 months post-transplant. Endpoint committee-defined CMV disease developed in 12.1% and 15.2% of valganciclovir and ganciclovir patients, respectively, by 6 months, though with a difference in the relative efficacy of valganciclovir and ganciclovir between organs (i.e. CMV viremia during prophylaxis was significantly lower with valganciclovir (2.9% vs. 10.4%; p=0.001), but was comparable by 12 months (48.5% valganciclovir vs 48.8% ganciclovir).</s><s>Cytomegalovirus is an important cause of morbidity and mortality risk after lung transplantation. However, daily prophylaxis is associated with considerable expense, inconvenience, and morbidity risk. Subjects were then monitored for 28 +/- 13 months to identify outcomes and complications. There were no significant differences between the daily and 3-times-weekly groups with respect to survival free from cytomegalovirus infection or survival free from cytomegalovirus disease. However, in most cases the cytomegalovirus syndromes observed were mild and in many cases could be treated on an outpatient basis. Overall patient survival was better in the daily group, but the survival advantage did not appear to be related to a reduction in cytomegalovirus-related disease. We conclude that intravenous ganciclovir given 3 times weekly for 3 months after transplantation is as effective as daily ganciclovir given for a similar time period.</s><s>Cytomegalovirus prophylaxis by ganciclovir followed by high-dose acyclovir in renal transplantation: a randomized, controlled trial.</s><s>Without effective antiviral prophylaxis, cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease is a common cause of morbidity and mortality after liver transplantation. CMV disease occurred in only 1 of 110 patients (0.9%) receiving ganciclovir compared with 8 of 109 patients (7.3%) receiving acyclovir within the first year after transplantation (P =0.019). There was one case of CMV colitis in the ganciclovir group, whereas four cases of CMV syndrome, three cases of CMV pneumonia, and one case of CMV hepatitis developed in the acyclovir group. The only death from CMV disease occurred in an acyclovir-treated patient with CMV pneumonia. The emergence of ganciclovir-resistant strains of CMV was not found during the study. A prophylactic regimen of 2 weeks of IV ganciclovir followed by an additional 12 weeks of oral ganciclovir is superior to a similar regimen of IV ganciclovir followed by oral acyclovir and almost completely eliminates CMV disease after liver transplantation.</s>"

Whether clinical improvement can be maintained by subsequent inhaled therapy is unknown. inhaled budesonide/formoterol 320/9 microg, budesonide 400 microg, formoterol 9 microg or placebo for 12 months. Fewer patients receiving budesonide/formoterol withdrew from the study than those receiving budesonide, formoterol or placebo. Budesonide/formoterol patients had a prolonged time to first exacerbation (254 versus 96 days) and maintained higher FEV1 (99% versus 87% of baseline), both primary variables versus placebo. Budesonide/formoterol in a single inhaler (Symbicort) maintains the benefit of treatment optimisation, stabilising lung function and delaying exacerbations more effectively than either component drug alone or placebo.</s><s>To examine the effect of fluticasone propionate, 250 microg/salmeterol, 50 microg combination (FSC 250/50) twice daily on lung hyperinflation and associated measures of exercise performance in patients with COPD. A total of 185 patients (mean baseline FEV1 of 41% predicted) were enrolled. At a standardized time during exercise (isotime), FSC 250/50 increased postdose IC by 0.20 +/- 0.05 L over placebo with associated improvements in tidal volume and minute ventilation (p < 0.05 vs placebo at week 8). Improvement in exercise time was significantly correlated with the increase in IC (r = 0.45, p < 0.001) but not FEV1 (r = 0.23, p = 0.08). Predose comparisons of FSC 250/50 with salmeterol and placebo favored FSC 250/50. We conclude that FSC 250/50 decreases lung hyperinflation at rest and during exercise with an associated increase in exercise endurance time when compared with placebo.</s><s>This randomized controlled trial examined the benefits of combining an inhaled corticosteroid, fluticasone propionate (F), with an inhaled long-acting beta(2)-agonist, salmeterol (S), to treat the inflammatory and bronchoconstrictive components of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A significantly greater increase in predose FEV(1) at the endpoint was observed after FSC (156 ml) compared with S (107 ml, p = 0.012) and placebo (-4 ml, p < 0.0001). We conclude that FSC improved lung function and reduced the severity of dyspnea compared with individual components and placebo.</s><s>No currently available treatment is reported to reduce the exaggerated airway wall inflammation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We tested the hypothesis that inhaled combined long-acting beta2-agonist (salmeterol) and corticosteroid (fluticasone propionate) will reduce inflammation. After adjustment for multiplicity, comparisons between active and placebo were made for median change from baseline in the numbers of biopsy CD8+ and CD68+ cells/mm2 and sputum neutrophils. Combination therapy was associated with a reduction in biopsy CD8+ cells of -118 cells/mm2 (95% confidence interval [CI], -209 to -42; p = 0.02), a reduction of 36% over placebo (p = 0.001).</s><s>To compare the efficacy and safety of the inhaled corticosteroid fluticasone propionate (FP) and the inhaled long-acting beta(2)-agonist salmeterol (SM), when administered together in a single device (Diskus; GlaxoSmithKline, Inc; Research Triangle Park, NC), with that of placebo and the individual agents alone in patients with COPD. Seven hundred twenty-three patients > or =40 years of age with COPD and a mean baseline FEV(1) of 42% predicted. Other efficacy measures were as follows: morning peak expiratory flow rate (PEF); transition dyspnea index; chronic respiratory disease questionnaire; chronic bronchitis symptom questionnaire; exacerbations; and other symptomatic measures. At Endpoint (ie, the last on-treatment, post-baseline assessment), treatment with FSC significantly (p < or = 0.012) increased the morning predose FEV(1) (165 mL) compared with SM (91 mL) and placebo (1 mL), and significantly (p < or = 0.001) increased the 2-h postdose FEV(1) (281 mL) compared with FP (147 mL) and placebo (58 mL). Compared with placebo, FSC significantly improved dyspnea, quality of life, and symptoms of chronic bronchitis. The incidence of adverse effects (except for an increase in oral candidiasis with FSC and FP) were similar among the treatment groups.</s><s>Bronchodilator agents are central to the symptomatic management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), and long-acting inhaled bronchodilators are regarded as more convenient. The role of inhaled corticosteroids still remains controversial, but there is increasing evidence that they may improve FEV(1) and symptoms in the long-term. of the present small pilot study was to compare Salmeterol & Fluticasone (SM&FP) 50/250 microg bid via a single Diskus inhaler with SM 50 microg bid alone, and with placebo (P) in the treatment of moderate COPD. t-test, anova in each treatment group, and anova among basal values and among the 52 week values were used, being p<0.05 accepted. Also changes (DeltaFEV(1)) from baseline were compared at different control times. The mean number of exacerbations/yr decreased from 3.5+/-0.8 to 1.16+/-0.75 s.d. over the baseline pre-treatment value after 36 weeks of treatment (anova p<0.001), being FEV(1) unchanged after 52 weeks of treatment in SM group (+0.33%+/-2.4 s.d.) After 52 weeks of treatment, only subjects treated with SM&FP showed a reduction of the daily symptoms score from 3.6+/-0.7 to 2.0+/-0.2 s.d.</s><s>Inhaled long-acting beta2 agonists improve lung function and health status in symptomatic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), whereas inhaled corticosteroids reduce the frequency of acute episodes of symptom exacerbation and delay deterioration in health status. We postulated that a combination of these treatments would be better than each component used alone. 1465 patients with COPD were recruited from outpatient departments in 25 countries. We assessed adverse events, serum cortisol concentrations, skin bruising, and electrocardiograms. Combination treatment produced a clinically significant improvement in health status and the greatest reduction in daily symptoms. Because inhaled long-acting beta2 agonists and corticosteroid combination treatment produces better control of symptoms and lung function, with no greater risk of side-effects than that with use of either component alone, this combination treatment should be considered for patients with COPD.</s><s>The efficacy and safety of budesonide/formoterol in a single inhaler compared with placebo, budesonide and formoterol were evaluated in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Severe exacerbations and FEV1 (primary variables), peak expiratory flow (PEF), COPD symptoms, health-related quality of life (HRQL), mild exacerbations, use of reliever beta2-agonist and safety variables were recorded. Budesonide/formoterol reduced the mean number of severe exacerbations per patient per year by 24% versus placebo and 23% versus formoterol.

However, the combination of BCNU plus high-dose methylprednisolone tended to be less effective than BCNU alone in patients with poor prognosis.</s><s>Forty-one consecutive patients with supratentorial primary brain tumors (38 Grade III and IV astrocytomas, one giant-cell astrocytoma, and two cases with insufficient tissue for diagnosis) were randomly allocated within 2 weeks of surgery to one of three therapeutic groups. Group 1 (15 patients) received radiation therapy totaling 4000 to 4500 rads in 4 to 5 weeks. Group 2 (13 patients) received 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea CCNU) 130 mg/sq m orally every 6 weeks. When the disease progressed, patients in Groups 1 and 2 were crossed over to receive CCNU and irradiation respectively. The median time from diagnosis to crossover (Groups 1 and 2) or to progression (Group 3) was 163, 99, and 220 days, and the mean time was 172, 108, and 231 days.</s><s>Within 4 weeks after definitive surgery, 91 patients with supratentorial glioblastomas and malignant astrocytomas were randomized to one of three treatment arms: Group 1 received radiotherapy alone; Group 2 received dibromodulcitol (DBD) during radiotherapy, and treatment was then continued with DBD; and Group 3 received DBD during radiotherapy, followed by combination chemotherapy of CCNU and DBD. No severe myelotoxicity occurred, but combined treatment with CCNU and DBD occasionally caused a transient myelosuppression. The ratio of patients surviving over 18 and 24 months was highest in Group 3. This study suggests that the administration of DBD during irradiation might have been the main factor in improving survival times.</s><s>A prospective, randomized trial evaluates the effects of two postoperative treatment regimens on survival in 198 adult patients with supratentorial gliomas. All patients were irradiated with 6,000 rads after possibly radical removal of tumors. Tumor histological malignancy and patients age were found to be the only important prognostic factors, irrespective of the treatment modality.</s><s>Within three weeks of definitive surgical intervention, 467 patients with histologically proved malignant glioma were randomized to receive one of four treatment regimens: semustine (MeCCNU), radiotherapy, carmustine (BCNU) plus radiotherapy, or semustine plus radiotherapy. We analyzed the data for the total randomized population and for the 358 patients in whom the initial protocol specifications were met (the valid study group). Observed toxicity included acceptable skin reactions secondary to radiotherapy and reversible leukopenia and thrombocytopenia due to chemotherapy.</s>"

Patients with stage-1 endometrial carcinoma (grade 1 with deep [> or =50%] myometrial invasion, grade 2 with any invasion, or grade 3 with superficial [<50%] invasion) were enrolled. The primary study endpoints were locoregional recurrence and death, with treatment-related morbidity and survival after relapse as secondary endpoints. 5-year actuarial locoregional recurrence rates were 4% in the radiotherapy group and 14% in the control group (p<0.001). Endometrial-cancer-related death rates were 9% in the radiotherapy group and 6% in the control group (p=0.37). Grade 3-4 complications were seen in eight patients, of which seven were in the radiotherapy group (2%). 2-year survival after vaginal recurrence was 79%, in contrast to 21% after pelvic recurrence or distant metastases.</s><s>After surgery for intermediate-risk endometrial carcinoma, the vagina is the most frequent site of recurrence. This study established whether vaginal brachytherapy (VBT) is as effective as pelvic external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) in prevention of vaginal recurrence, with fewer adverse effects and improved quality of life. Estimated 5-year rates of vaginal recurrence were 1.8% (95% CI 0.6-5.9) for VBT and 1.6% (0.5-4.9) for EBRT (hazard ratio [HR] 0.78, 95% CI 0.17-3.49; p=0.74). 1.5% (0.5-4.5) versus 0.5% (0.1-3.4) of patients presented with isolated pelvic recurrence (HR 3.10, 0.32-29.9; p=0.30), and rates of distant metastases were similar (8.3% [5.1-13.4] vs 5.7% [3.3-9.9]; HR 1.32, 0.63-2.74; p=0.46). Rates of acute grade 1-2 gastrointestinal toxicity were significantly lower in the VBT group than in the EBRT group at completion of radiotherapy (12.6% [27/215] vs 53.8% [112/208]). VBT is effective in ensuring vaginal control, with fewer gastrointestinal toxic effects than with EBRT.</s><s>From 1968 to 1974, 540 patients with stage I adenocarcinoma of the corpus uteri entered a prospective clinical trial to evaluate the effect of postoperative external pelvic irradiation. At the time vaginal radium was given, randomization was performed: Group A received no further treatment (controls); group B received additional high-voltage irradiation to the pelvic field with a dose of 4000 rads to the pelvic lymph nodes. During the follow-up period of 3 to 10 years a significant reduction in vaginal and pelvic recurrences was found in group B as compared with group A (1.9 versus 6.9%, P < .01). On the other hand, more patients in group B developed distant metastases than those in group A (9.9 versus 5.4%). In almost 20% of 151 consecutive patients, tumor cells were found in endothelial lined spaces.</s><s>Despite their low risk for recurrence, many women with endometrial adenocarcinoma receive postoperative radiation therapy (RT). Four hundred forty-eight consenting patients with \"intermediate risk\" endometrial adenocarcinoma were randomized after surgery to either no additional therapy (NAT) or whole pelvic radiation therapy (RT). They were followed to determine toxicity, date and location of recurrence, and overall survival. Three hundred ninety-two women met all eligibility requirements (202 NAT, 190 RT). The treatment difference was particularly evident among the HIR subgroup (2-year CIR in NAT versus RT: 26% versus 6%; RH=0.42). Overall, radiation had a substantial impact on pelvic and vaginal recurrences (18 in NAT and 3 in RT).</s><s>The purpose of the study was to compare postoperative vaginal irradiation with surgery alone in low-risk International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IA-IB endometrial carcinoma. Perspex vaginal applicators or ovoids were normally used, and the dose was specified at 5 mm from the surface of the applicator. Three to 6 fractions (3.0-8.0 Gy) were given, and the overall treatment time was 4 to 15 days. The locoregional recurrence rate was 2.6%, whereas distant metastases occurred in 1.4%. The conclusions were that the impact of postoperative brachytherapy on even the locoregional recurrence rate seems to be limited in patients with low-risk endometrial carcinoma.</s>"

We included 28 patients, mean age was 11.6 years, five had metastatic disease. Grade 1 and 2 audiologic toxicity was present in 100% of the experimental group against 85% of the controls (p = 0.501). There were no statistical significant differences between the two groups for chemotherapy-related toxicity. amifostine did not reduce the ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity of our treatment regime.</s><s>To test potential protection by ICRF-187 against cumulative doxorubicin-dose-related cardiac toxicity, we conducted a randomized clinical trial in 150 women with advanced breast cancer. In this updated analysis of the entire patient cohort, we provide additional support for these findings and demonstrate that patients in the ICRF-187 group received more cycles (median, 11) and higher cumulative doses (median, 500 mg/m2) of doxorubicin than patients in the control group (median, nine cycles, P less than .01; and 441 mg/m2, P less than .05). Twenty-six patients in the ICRF-187 group received doxorubicin doses of at least 700 mg/m2, and among them, 11 patients received 1,000 mg/m2 or more. Only three patients in the control group received doxorubicin doses of 700 mg/m2; the maximum dose administered to one patient in this group was 950 mg/m2. ICRF-187 cardiac protection was observed in patients with and without prior chest-wall radiation or other risk factors for developing doxorubicin cardiac toxicity. By protecting against cumulative doxorubicin-induced cardiac toxicity, ICRF-187 permits significantly greater doses of doxorubicin to be administered to patients with greater safety.</s><s>To determine the cardioprotective effect of dexrazoxane (DZR) used in a doxorubicin-based combination therapy in advanced breast cancer. Between November 1988 and January 1991, 534 patients with advanced breast cancer were randomized to two multicenter, double-blind studies (088001 and 088006). Patients received fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC) with either DZR (DZR-to-doxorubicin ratio, 10:1) or placebo (PLA) every 3 weeks and were monitored with serial multiplegated acquisition (MUGA) scans. The objective response rates for 088001 were 46.8% for DZR and 60.5% for PLA, a difference of 14% (95% CI, -25% to -2%; P = .019), and for 088006 were 53.7% for DZR and 49.3% for PLA, a difference of 4% (95% CI, -13% to 22%; P = .63). One of the two studies (088001) showed a lower response rate with DZR, but time to progression and survival were not significantly different.</s><s>We conducted an open-label, randomized trial to determine whether ICRF-187 would reduce doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in pediatric sarcoma patients. The two groups were compared for incidence and degree of cardiotoxicity, response rates to four cycles of chemotherapy, event-free and overall survival, and incidence and severity of noncardiac toxicities. Eighteen ICRF-187-treated and 15 control patients were assessable for cardiac toxicity. Objective response rates were identical in the two groups, with no significant differences seen in event-free or overall survival. ICRF-187-treated patients had a significantly higher incidence of transient grade 1 serum transaminase elevations and a trend toward increased hematologic toxicity. Additional clinical trials with larger numbers of patients are needed to determine if the short-term cardioprotection afforded by ICRF-187 will reduce the incidence of late cardiac complications in long-term survivors of childhood cancer.</s><s>Dexrazoxane was found effective in reducing doxorubicin cardiotoxicity when given at a dose ratio (dexrazoxane: doxorubicin) of 20:1. The main objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of dexrazoxane, given at a dose ratio of 10:1 against epirubicin cardiotoxicity. One hundred sixty-two advanced breast cancer patients were randomized to receive epirubicin-based chemotherapy with or without dexrazoxane. Patients who had previously received adjuvant chemotherapy that contained anthracyclines were treated with cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 intravenously (IV), epirubicin 60 mg/m2 IV, and fluorouracil 600 mg/m2 IV, on day 1 every 3 weeks. Noncardiac toxicity, objective response, progression-free survival, and overall survival were similar in both arms. The clinical use of dexrazoxane should be recommended in patients whose risk of developing cardiotoxicity could hamper the eventual use and possible benefit of epirubicin.</s><s>The aim of this study was to determine the protective effect of carvedilol in anthracycline (ANT)-induced cardiomyopathy (CMP). Despite its broad effectiveness, ANT therapy is associated with ANT-induced CMP. Recent animal studies and experimental observations showed that carvedilol prevented development of CMP due to chemotherapeutics. The patients were evaluated with echocardiography before and after chemotherapy. At the end of 6 months of follow-up, 1 patient in the carvedilol group and 4 in the control group had died. Control EF was below 50% in 1 patient in the carvedilol group and in 5 in the control group. Both systolic and diastolic diameters were significantly increased compared with basal measures in the control group. In Doppler study, whereas E velocities in the carvedilol group decreased, E velocities and E/A ratios were significantly reduced in the control group.</s><s>Two groups of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or non-Hodgkin lymphoma, treated with anthracyclines (ANT), were studied: group I, consisting of 10 patients, with coenzyme Q10 (CoQ) therapy; group II, consisting of 10 patients without CoQ therapy. Interventricular septum wall thickening decreased only in group II from baseline (46.10 +/- 10.1) to end therapy (27.00 +/- 18.54) (P < 0.01). Septum wall motion abnormalities were detected only in 2 patients of group II.</s><s>Current treatment strategies for Hodgkin lymphoma result in excellent survival but often confer significant long-term toxicity. Efficient induction of early response by dose-dense drug delivery supported an early-response-adapted therapeutic paradigm. Slow early responders received 2 additional ABVE-PC cycles before 21 Gy radiation. With this regimen, cumulative doses of alkylators, anthracyclines, and epipodophyllotoxins are below thresholds usually associated with significant long-term toxicity. ABVE-PC is a dose-dense regimen that provides outstanding event-free survival/overall survival with short duration, early-response-adapted therapy.</s><s>We conducted a randomized trial to evaluate primarily the cardioprotective effect of dexrazoxane (DEX) in patients with advanced breast cancer and soft tissue sarcomas (STS) treated with high-dose epirubicin (EPI). In either disease, antitumor response rates, time to progression, and survival did not significantly differ between the two arms. All methods of cardiac evaluation clearly documented the cardioprotective effect of DEX. The decrease in LVEF from baseline was significantly greater in the control group. An abnormal antimyosin uptake was observed early in both arms and progressively increased during treatment. However, this increase was significantly higher in the EPI group (P = .004). Although RIS is a sensitive technique in detecting anthracycline cardiac damage, its specificity is low and it cannot be considered a primary test for guiding anthracycline treatment.</s><s>Chemotherapy regimens based on anthracycline (doxorubicin) are well established in lymphoma therapy. The plasma lipid profile and relative mRNA levels of key enzymes of oxidative metabolism (carnitine acyltransferases) were measured at three points of time. In addition to the clinical parameters we used the mRNA of white blood cells to evaluate the toxic effects on cardiomyocytes. In the present study no cardiotoxicity of anthracycline therapy was detected.</s><s>However, the amount of ADM that can be administered must be limited because of the risk of developing a severe dose-dependent myocardiopathy. Prenylamine (PNL), a calcium antagonistic drug, provided partial protection against ADM-induced cardiotoxicity in mice and in the rabbit. Standard ECG and chest radiographs were performed at the beginning of treatment and every two months. In Group A, three patients died from oncological causes, total ADM dose was 359 +/- 100 mg/m2, and the mean age was 59.7 years. These findings suggest that simultaneous administration of PNL may mitigate ADM cardiotoxicity, but larger trials are needed to draw definite conclusions.</s><s>Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity has led to the adoption of empirical dose limits that may restrict continued use of anthracyclines among patients who might benefit. Compared with those receiving anthracycline alone, patients treated with dexrazoxane experienced significantly fewer cardiac events (39% versus 13%, P < 0.001) and a lower and less severe incidence of congestive heart failure (11% versus 1%, P < 0.05). The frequency of adverse events was similar between groups and there were no significant between-group differences in the number of dose modifications/interruptions. Dexrazoxane significantly reduced the occurrence and severity of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity in patients at increased risk of cardiac dysfunction due to previous anthracycline treatment without compromising the antitumor efficacy of the chemotherapeutic regimen.</s><s>Pilot study, examining the cardioprotective effect of an antioxidant regimen in patients with malignancies receiving high dose chemo- or radiotherapy. 14 patients with chemotherapy and 10 patients with radiotherapy were randomized in a double-blind fashion (placebo versus vitamin E and C and N-acetylcysteine). Patients on antioxidants showed no significant fall in EF (radiotherapy: 63 +/- 8 to 61 +/- 7%, chemotherapy: 67 +/- 5 to 64 +/- 6%). The preliminary results, however, suggest efficient cardioprotection by this cheap and safe antioxidant combination, so that larger studies are warranted for confirmation.</s><s>Aim of the present study was to assess the effect of epirubicin-based chemotherapy on QT interval dispersion in patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and the effect of dexrazoxane supplementation. Twenty untreated patients, <or=60 years of age with newly-diagnosed aggressive NHL, eligible for a treatment with epirubicin-based chemotherapy were selected for the study. The patients underwent 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) before and after epirubicin infusion and after dexrazoxane supplementation. All the 20 patients showed increased QT dispersion (44.3 +/- 8.4 vs. 68.4+/-11.4 ms, P<0.001) and QTc dispersion (46.2 +/- 6.2 vs. 72.2 +/- 8.4, P<0.001) after chemotherapy infusion. Therefore, dexrazoxane can reduce the arrhythmic risk in patients treated with epirubicin.</s><s>Doxorubicin chemotherapy is very effective in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) but also injures myocardial cells. Dexrazoxane, a free-radical scavenger, may protect the heart from doxorubicin-associated damage. Serial measurements of serum cardiac troponin T were obtained in 76 of 101 patients in the doxorubicin group and 82 of 105 patients in the group given dexrazoxane and doxorubicin. Troponin T levels were evaluated in a blinded fashion to determine whether they were elevated (>0.01 ng per milliliter)--the primary end point--or extremely elevated (>0.025 ng per milliliter). Elevations of troponin T occurred in 35 percent of the patients (55 of 158).</s>"

Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either alcohol-based or alcohol-free melaleuca oral solution four times daily for 2-4 weeks. Thirteen patients were enrolled into cohort 1, and 14 patients were enrolled into cohort 2. The main outcome measure was resolution of clinical lesions of oral candidiasis. Evaluations were performed at 2 and 4 weeks for clinical signs and symptoms of oral candidiasis and quantitative yeast cultures. Overall, using a modified intent-to-treat analysis, 60% of patients demonstrated a clinical response to the melaleuca oral solution (7 patients cured and 8 patients clinically improved) at the 4-week evaluation.</s><s>Over 37 months, we conducted a prospective double-blind, randomized study in a cohort of 138 HIV-infected patients to compare the effect of two different strategies on the prevention and treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis relapses and on the development of clinical and microbiological resistance to fluconazole. Microbiological resistance was recorded in 12 patients (eight in the fluconazole group, four in the placebo group; P = 0.20). There were no significant treatment group differences in microbiological resistance whether comparisons were made for all cases or for cases up to 1 month post-study. In the few patients who developed clinical and/or microbiological resistance, the cumulative dose of fluconazole before entry into the study was a mean value of 8.6 g (compared with 2.9 g in patients without clinical and/or microbiological resistance). Development of resistant candidiasis (clinical and/or microbiological) was rarely seen in either group and its incidence was not significantly different.</s><s>This double-blind trial compared the clinical and mycological efficacy and safety of itraconazole oral solution with those of fluconazole capsules in the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis in patients with AIDS. A total of 244 patients were enrolled and randomized to one of three groups for treatment with itraconazole oral solution (100 mg twice daily for 7 days or 100 mg once daily for 14 days) or fluconazole capsules (100 mg once daily for 14 days). Among 194 evaluable cases, complete response (clearance of all symptoms and signs) or marked improvement was noted in 54 of 60 patients (90%) receiving once-daily itraconazole and in 65 of 72 fluconazole-treated patients (90%) at the end of treatment; these results were statistically equivalent (P = .0024).</s><s>Fluconazole, a newly available triazole, has been evaluated extensively as a treatment for thrush. It has been effective in the treatment of this condition in patients with HIV infection. Clotrimazole troches have been a common treatment for thrush in patients with HIV infection for several years. Clinical cure was superior with fluconazole tablets than with clotrimazole troches. Also, rates of colonization at the end of therapy and relapse at days 28 and 42 were less with fluconazole tablets than with clotrimazole troches.</s><s>In a randomized, open study, the efficacy of fluconazole as a prophylaxis of recurrent oral candidiasis in patients with advanced stages of HIV-infection (CD4 cell count less than 100/mm3) was studied. Sixty-five HIV-positive patients were included in the study from May, 1989 to January, 1990. Prophylaxis with fluconazole clearly reduced the occurrence of oral candidiasis. In the group receiving 100 mg/day (group 3), four out of 19 patients had nine relapses in total. In group 3, relapse treatment with fluconazole 200 mg/day, or treatment with ketoconazole, became necessary in 116 out of 3314 observation days (3%). As compared to the untreated control group, fluconazole prophylaxis in a daily dosage of 50 as well as 100 mg led to significantly less frequent relapses of oral candidiasis (p less than 0.01).</s><s>To determine the efficacy and toxicity of two systemically active antifungal agents in the treatment of buccal and oesophageal candidiasis 111 HIV-infected patients with microscopically-confirmed candidiasis were randomized to receive either 200 mg itraconazole once a day or 200 mg ketoconazole twice a day for 28 days in a double blind study. After 1 week of treatment, 75 and 82% of the patients on itraconazole and ketoconazole, respectively, had responded clinically.</s><s>Recurrent oropharyngeal candidiasis is common in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related complex. It causes local pain and discomfort, loss of taste, and aversion to food and may lead to secondary complications. If thrush occurred, prophylaxis was stopped and patients were treated conventionally, after which prophylaxis was resumed. After the randomized study, some patients were given continuous fluconazole (open phase). One episode of thrush occurred in the open phase in an intermittently compliant patient (group total, 71.5 patient-months of fluconazole treatment); in contrast, the 25 patients also had had two episodes of Candida esophagitis, three of cryptococcosis, and 13 of dermatophytosis before entry. Larger trials to confirm prevention of all mycoses with prophylaxis should be considered.</s><s>In a randomised, double-blind study the efficacy and toxicity of oral fluconazole 50 mg daily and ketoconazole 200 mg daily were compared for the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and AIDS-related complex (ARC). 20 episodes (18 patients) were treated with fluconazole and 20 episodes (19 patients) with ketoconazole. Pretreatment clinical features and laboratory test results were similar in both groups. Cultures were negative at the end of therapy in 87% of the fluconazole group and 69% of the ketoconazole group.</s><s>To determine if chlorhexidine can be used as an intervention to prolong the time to relapse of oral candidiasis. Clotrimazole troche was prescribed, and the subjects were re-examined every 2 weeks until the lesions were completely eradicated. The time to recurrence of oral candidiasis between the chlorhexidine and the saline group was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). The subjects with lower lymphocyte showed shorter oral candidiasis-free periods (P = 0.034). Further study should be performed to better assess the size of the effect, or to confirm our findings.</s><s>In an open multicentre study the efficacy and safety of fluconazole versus ketoconazole were evaluated in the treatment of 46 pediatric patients with oropharyngeal candidiasis and AIDS or HIV infection. Results showed that fluconazole and ketoconazole have comparable efficacy and safety in the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis in HIV-infected children. One case of drug-related side effects (diarrhea and abdominal pain) in a patient receiving ketoconazole resulted in discontinuation of treatment. Follow-up examinations 2 and 4 weeks post-treatment showed a comparably high rate of relapse in both patient groups.</s><s>The efficacy of oral itraconazole and ketoconazole in the treatment of oropharyngeal and/or esophageal candidiasis, and the rate of post-treatment relapse, were compared in a multicenter, prospective, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, parallel-group trial. Patients were evaluated clinically and mycologically after 1, 2 and 4 (for esophageal patients) weeks of therapy, and relapses were compared in a 6-week post-treatment follow-up period. Of 129 evaluable patients, 98 had oropharyngeal candidiasis and 31 esophageal infection. Marginally significant differences were found between itraconazole and ketoconazole in rates of clearing of infection clinically in patients with oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis (p = 0.0614 and 0.0781, respectively). Itraconazole is marginally more efficacious than ketoconazole in the treatment of oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis in HIV-positive patients and both drugs appear safe and well tolerated.</s><s>The effects of continuous or intermittent therapy with fluconazole on the recurrence of and the development of fluconazole resistance are not known. Development of resistance was defined as a fourfold rise in minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to at least 16 microg/mL from the initial culture in the same species, the emergence of new, resistant (MIC > or =16 microg/mL) species, or a significant increase in the proportion of resistant isolates. During a mean follow-up of 11 months, median annual relapse rates were lower in patients on continuous therapy (0 episodes/year) than in patients on intermittent therapy (4.1 episodes/year; P <0.001). Sterile cultures were seen in 6 of 16 (38%) patients on continuous therapy compared with 3 of 28 (11%) on intermittent therapy (P = 0.04). Microbiological resistance developed in 9 of 16 (56%) patients on continuous treatment, compared with 13 of 28 (46%) on intermittent treatment (P = 0.75). In patients with frequent recurrences, continuous suppressive therapy significantly reduced relapses and colonization.</s><s>To assess the efficacy and tolerance of fluconazole (150 mg oral dose, once a week) in the prevention of recurrent oropharyngeal candidiasis in patients with moderate to severe human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Pre-treatment clinical and laboratory characteristics were similar in the two groups. One patient in the placebo group and 18 patients in the fluconazole group completed six months' treatment without clinical relapse (P < 0.001).</s><s>In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients, fluconazole prophylaxis is associated with reductions in the rate of fungal infection. However, concerns exist with regard to the use of fluconazole prophylaxis and the risk of development of fluconazole treatment-refractory infections. We performed a randomized, open-label trial that compared oral fluconazole given continuously (200 mg 3 times weekly; the \"continuous fluconazole arm\") with fluconazole that was provided only for episodes of orophayngeal candidiasis (OPC) or esophageal candidiasis (EC) (the \"episodic fluconazole arm\") in HIV-infected persons with CD4+ T cell counts of <150 cells/mm3 and a history of OPC. The primary study end point was the time to development of fluconazole-refractory OPC or EC, which was defined as lack of response to 200 mg fluconazole given daily for 14 or 21 days, respectively.</s><s>A total of 167 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with oropharyngeal candidiasis were randomly assigned to receive 14 days of therapy with liquid suspension fluconazole (100 mg once daily) or liquid nystatin (500,000 U four times daily). The fluconazole group had fewer relapses noted on day 28 (18%, vs. 44% in the nystatin group; P < .001).</s><s>Fluconazole 50 mg daily for 14-28 days was effective in the treatment of patients with AIDS and AIDS-related complex with severe oropharyngeal and oesophageal candidiasis. Following clinical cure, 14 patients were entered into the double-blind phase of the study, where fluconazole (150 mg) or placebo capsules were given once weekly. Fluconazole 150 mg once weekly was found to be effective in maintaining patients both clinically and mycologically free of oropharyngeal candidiasis.</s><s>To compare the tolerance, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of amphotericin deoxycholate (Fungizone) prepared in a parenteral fat emulsion (Intralipid 20%) or glucose in HIV patients with candidiasis. All the amphotericin-fat emulsion infusions were given without serious problem whereas four amphotericin-glucose infusions were stopped because of renal impairment (n = 3) or severe chills (n = 2), or both. Magnesium concentration fell significantly with amphotericin-glucose but not with amphotericin-fat emulsion. Serum amphotericin concentrations were significantly lower and the volume of distribution of the drug higher after infusion of amphotericin-fat emulsion than after amphotericin-glucose.</s><s>A randomized un-blinded study on the treatment of oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis was conducted in Kinshasa (Zaire), among 141 inpatients with AIDS and oropharyngeal candidiasis, of whom 136 also had esophageal candidiasis. The study compared the efficacy of gentian violet mouth washes (1.5 ml 0.5% aqueous solution b.i.d. Patients treated with mouth washes swallowed their medication after mouth washing. Patients enrolled in this study had a very high mortality (probability of death: 41.6% after 14 days). At that time, oropharyngeal lesions had disappeared in similar proportions of patients treated with gentian violet (11/26, 42%) and ketoconazole (10/23, 43%), and in a lower proportion of patients treated with nystatin (2/23, 9%; p less than 0.05). As it is very cheap (0.5 US$/treatment course in Kinshasa), we suggest that its use should be assessed in larger studies.</s>"

        "Abstracts": "<s>A review of prosthetic prescription practice reveals that in the United Kingdom about 85% of below and above-knee amputees are fitted with uniaxial feet, whereas in the United States about 80% are fitted with SACH feet. An evaluation method was developed to assess the performance of these two different types of feet. This set-up allowed three-dimensional analysis on the prosthetic and contralateral sides of the subject. Investigations were undertaken in which an experimental prosthesis permitted the interchange of the ankle/foot while keeping the rest of the components the same. It is the purpose of this paper to discuss these differences and their significance.</s><s>This study evaluated the SACH and the Greissinger Plus prosthetic feet, in terms of the symmetry provided between the lower limbs, in the case of unilateral transtibial amputees 16.3 weeks from the time of limb fitting and 38.9 weeks from surgery. Sagittal plane gait analysis was carried out for nine right-limb traumatic amputees. In all examined cases, the spatial and temporal parameters measured were significantly improved.</s><s>Gait analysis was performed on eight men who had unilateral traumatic below-knee amputation and on nine control subjects. During ambulation with the Flex Foot, there was a pattern of larger late vertical forces but smaller late anteroposterior and mediolateral forces. This is consistent with a medial heel whip, and it was observed when the Flex Foot was used. Three months after the biomechanical studies, four subjects used the Flex Foot exclusively, two used the Seattle Foot exclusively, and two used both, ie, the Flex Foot for sports and the Seattle Foot for work.</s><s>The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of prosthetic foot design on the vertical ground reaction forces experienced by the sound and amputated limbs in a group of persons with dysvascular below-knee amputations. Results indicated that the sound limb was exposed to higher vertical ground reaction forces than normal despite a reduced walking velocity. In addition, there was increased loading response knee flexion of the sound limb indicating an attempt by these subjects to modulate floor impact.</s><s>A 3-factor (foot type, speed, and mode of ambulation) repeated-measures experimental design was used. To compare the differences in energy expenditure, gait efficiency, and relative exercise intensity in persons with transtibial amputations with various prostheses. We used progressive speeds of treadmill walking (53.64, 67.05, 80.46, 93.87, and 107.28 m/min) and running (120.69, 134.1, and 147.51 m/min) with 3 different types of prostheses: the Solid Ankle Cushion Heel (SACH) foot, the Flex-Foot (FF), and the Re-Flex Vertical Shock Pylon (VSP) prosthesis. The following statistically significant differences (improvements) between the Re-Flex VSP versus the FF and the SACH foot were found. Energy cost: walking (5%), running (11%); gait efficiency: walking (6%), running (9%); relative exercise intensity: walking (4%), running (5%).</s><s>Loading response challenges the limb with the dual demands of accepting rapidly moving body weight to both absorb the shock of floor contact and create a stable limb over which the body can advance. Ten male individuals with transtibial amputations were tested on three separate occasions wearing each prosthetic foot. A comparison group of ten individuals without transtibial amputations was also examined. Contralateral toe off times were significantly later for each prosthetic foot (p < 0.01). Two altered functions were found for all three prosthetic feet, reduced knee flexion and prolonged heel only support. To improve the walking abilities of those persons with transtibial amputations, prosthetic foot designs need to incorporate mechanisms which promote early foot flat while preserving limb stability.</s><s>The purpose of this pilot study was to investigate some of the new dynamic elastic response (DER) prosthetic feet compared to the SACH foot and determine if any demonstrated trends of producing the most optimum gait. Minimal differences in either free or fast walking were noted between the five feet. Based on this pilot data, recommendations are made for future studies including appropriate sample size.</s><s>The great diversity of prosthetic mechanisms available nowadays leads to the question of which type of artificial foot would be the most advisable for a particular person. This knowledge is obtained by means of the study of the subject-prosthesis interaction, both in static and dynamic conditions. This paper, based on the analysis of 8 trans-tibial (TT) amputees, presents a quantitative method for the study of human gait which allows the determination of the influence of four different prosthetic ankle-foot mechanisms (SACH, Single-axis, Greissinger and Dynamic) on gait. From all the variables available for study only those which offered interpretable clinical information were chosen for analysis. A total of 18 variables (kinetic, kinematic and time-related) were selected.</s><s>Recent advancement in prosthetic technology has led to the development of dynamic elastic response feet (DER), which are reported to store and release energy to facilitate gait. To date, there has been no objective evidence to suggest energy conservation while using these foot designs. The purpose of this study was to compare the energy expenditure of five commercially available prosthetic feet (SACH and four DER feet) in both the traumatic and dysvascular populations during level walking. This increased rate was a function of the greater walking velocity employed by the traumatic subjects, made possible by their better physical fitness.</s><s>The subjective responses and gait patterns of unilateral knee disarticulation amputees wearing prostheses fitted first with the Multiflex foot and then with the Quantum foot were studied. Preference seemed not to be related to physical characteristics of the amputees nor to gait parameters. There were no differences in gait as far as the temporal factors were concerned. During walking at comfortable speed with the Multiflex foot the ankle and hip range of motion averaged 2.1 and 3.1 degrees respectively, less than during walking with the Quantum foot.</s><s>A comparison of the SACH and single axis foot in the gait of unilateral below-knee amputees.</s><s>This study scientifically measures the dynamic gait characteristics and energy consumption of 16 male below-knee amputees, eight vascular and eight traumatic, while wearing solid ankle cushion heel (SACH), single axis and multiple axis prosthetic feet via six-camera motion analysis, metabolic measurement cart and heavy-duty treadmill. Subjective results are additionally determined via questionnaire after testing. Motion analysis showed statistically significant differences at P<0.05 between the SACH, single axis and multiple axis foot in the velocity, cadence, stride length and single limb stance.</s><s>In this study, the metabolic performances of a new energy-storing foot (Proteor) and of the solid-ankle cushion heel (SACH) are compared. Twelve patients with traumatic below-knee amputations (mean age: 50.0 +/- 19.9 years) and 12 patients with vascular below-knee amputations (mean age: 73 +/- 7 years) were studied. Vascular explorations were done in the vascular patients: distal pressure measurements, pulse plethysmography, transcutaneous oxygen tension. However, in subjects with vascular amputation, this foot did not produce an increased free velocity nor an improved energy cost. During the level treadmill test, the traumatic amputee subjects showed a decrease of energy expenditure with the new prosthetic foot, more significant at sufficient speed (4 km/h): 17.00 +/- 3.42 vs 14.67 +/- 2.05 mL/kg/min (p < .05). There is no significant difference in cardiocirculatory effects between the two types of prosthetic foot.</s><s>Altered gait patterns resulting from amputation has been implicated as a possible mechanism for early degenerative changes in the sound limb of unilateral amputees. The purpose of this study was to examine the ground reaction force characteristics and joint motion in this population. Ground reaction forces, joint motion, and stride characteristics of 10 traumatic below-knee amputees were analyzed while wearing five different prosthetic feet (SACH, Flex-foot, Carbon Copy II, Seattle, and Quantum). Results indicated that the Flex-foot significantly reduced the initial peak of the vertical ground reaction force on the sound limb compared to all other feet tested (p < .0001).</s><s>To investigate the physiologic differences during multispeed treadmill walking and physical activity profiles for the Otto Bock C-Walk foot (C-Walk), Flex-Foot, and solid ankle cushion heel (SACH) foot in people with transtibial amputation. One-way ANOVA was employed to analyze foot-type differences for self-selected walking velocity (SSWV), and steps per day (daily activity). Analysis of covariance was used to analyze foot-type differences with SSWV as the covariable for the physiologic measurements. Compared with the C-Walk and SACH, the Flex-Foot showed no significant differences in energy expenditure and gait efficiency, but significantly lower percentage of age-predicted maximum heart rate and RPE values.</s><s>To determine the effects of two different prosthetic feet on the three-dimensional kinetic patterns of both the prosthetic and sound limbs during unilateral trans-tibial amputee gait. Despite the wide variation in the design of prosthetic feet, the benefits of these prostheses remain unclear. During each test session, peak joint moments and powers in the sagittal, transverse and frontal planes were examined, as subjects walked at a comfortable speed. The dynamic Flex foot allowed subjects to rely more heavily on the prosthetic foot for propulsion and stability during walking with minimal compensations at the remaining joints. This information, when used in conjunction with subjective preferences, may contribute to higher functioning and greater satisfaction for individuals with a lower limb amputation.</s><s>This study compared the mechanical and biomechanical functions, metabolic demand, and shock absorption of two dynamic elastic response (DER) prosthetic foot designs with the SACH foot. Nine individuals who had undergone unilateral below knee amputation were studied.</s><s>This study evaluated biomechanical and metabolic performance differences between two prosthetic foot designs in light of their mechanical properties. Increased efficiency of pushoff in the Seattle Ankle/Lite Foot exists as evidenced by the decrease loading on the opposite limb during double support and a less shortened step length on the sound side compared to the SACH foot. Comfortable walking speed and the nadir of metabolic rate and efficiency are not different.</s><s>Dynamic elastic response foot and ankle prostheses (Seattle-Lite, Flex Foot, etc.) used by transtibial amputees feature substantial design improvements over conventional designs (SACH, Single Axis, etc.). Despite this progress, transtibial amputees continue to expend greater energy than normals. In early stance, peak foot and shank velocities were lower (p < 0.01) for both the SL and FF while only shank velocity was lower (p < 0.01) with the SA compared to NA controls. Significant delays in the timing of early stance events such as peak shank velocity, peak ankle plantarflexion and peak knee flexion compromised shank and knee stability in TT amputees. In NA controls on the other hand, appropriate timing and rate of segment velocity changes preserved dynamic stability and forward progression in early stance. This was evidenced by rapid decreases in foot and shank velocity as the thigh velocity increased during weight acceptance.</s><s>In this study, the influence of different prosthetic alignments and components on oxygen consumption and the important biomechanical characteristics of the normal gait pattern of leg amputees was investigated. With 15 transtibial and 12 transfemoral amputees, the oxygen consumption during walking on a treadmill was analyzed and biomechanical parameters during walking on even ground at a self-selected speed were defined. Compared with conventional hydraulic knee controls, the oxygen consumption of transfemoral amputees provided with an electronically controlled hydraulic knee joint is reduced.</s>"

The study design was a prospective, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial. The criteria for exclusion included arthritides other than osteoarthritis; an operation on the knee within the previous six months; symptomatic disease of the hip, ankle, or foot; a previous fracture of the tibia or femur; morbid obesity (a body-mass index of more than thirty-five kilograms per square meter); skin disease; peripheral vascular disease or varicose veins that would preclude use of a brace; a severe cardiovascular deficit; blindness; poor English-language skills; and an inability to apply a brace because of physical limitations such as arthritis in the hand or an inability to bend over. Treatment was assigned on the basis of a computer-generated block method of randomization with use of sealed envelopes. The control group consisted of forty patients (thirty-one men and nine women; mean age, 60.9 years); the neoprene-sleeve group, of thirty-eight patients (twenty-seven men and eleven women; mean age, 58.2 years); and the unloader-brace group, of forty-one patients (twenty-eight men and thirteen women; mean age, 59.5 years).

The efficacy of a novel insole with elastic subtalar strapping and a traditional shoe insert wedge insole was compared. These significant differences were not found in the group with the inserted insole (n = 44). The novel strapped insole leads to valgus angulation of the talus, resulting in correction of the femorotibial angle in patients with knee OA with varus deformity, and may have a therapeutic effect similar to that of high tibial osteotomy.</s><s>To assess the effect of an insole with subtalar strapping on patients with medial compartment osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee.

Iron stores at 3 months in term infants are not influenced by timing of cord clamping at birth.</s><s>The effect of early versus late cord clamping on signs of respiratory distress.</s><s>To examine the effects of the Leboyer method of delivery, we randomly assigned 56 women to either a Leboyer or a conventional delivery and used a variety of clinical and behavioral measures to assess the outcome in mother and child. Women who expected a Leboyer delivery had shorter active labors (P = 0.03), suggesting that psychologic factors (expectations) influence physical outcomes in perinatal medicine. Our results suggest that the Leboyer procedure has no advantage over a gentle, conventional delivery in influencing infant and maternal outcomes.</s><s>This study was carried out to assess whether delaying umbilical cord clamping is effective in improving the haematological status of term infants living in a malaria-endemic area, and whether this is associated with complications in infants and mothers. We randomly assigned women delivering term babies in Mpongwe Mission Hospital, Zambia, to delayed cord clamping (DCC, n = 46) or immediate cord clamping (controls, n = 45) and followed their infants on a bi-monthly basis until the age of 6 months. Throughout the observation period infant Hb levels in both groups declined, but more rapidly in controls than in the DCC group [difference in Hb change from baseline at 4 months 1.1 g/dl, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.2; 2.1].</s>"

        "Abstracts": "<s>The effects of laryngeal lignocaine spray and/or lignocaine jelly as lubricants were studied on the incidence of sore throat, hoarseness, or tracheal irritability as evidenced by either a tendency to cough or frank coughing after intubation with a Sensiv tube (Searle Medical Products). Pressure in the medium-volume, low-pressure cuff was controlled and kept below 2.5 kPa (25 cmH2O) during anaesthesia. The lowest number of patients (62%) with side-effects was found in the control group and the greatest (95%) after the combination of lignocaine jelly and spray (P less than 0.05). The number of side-effects after lignocaine jelly alone was 85% and after the spray alone 68%. Women were more prone to have side-effects, especially sore throat and hoarseness, than men (P less than 0.05). Endotracheal cuff pressures were also studied in 114 patients during N2O-O2 anaesthesia and in 54 patients after the replacement of N2O with nitrogen.</s><s>To test the hypothesis that continuous application of local anesthesia at the contact area between the endotracheal tube cuff and trachea would reduce both the incidence and severity of postoperative sore throat by blocking the tracheal pain receptors with local anesthetic delivered via endotracheal tube (ETT) cuff. The cuffs of the lidocaine group were prefilled with lidocaine for 90 minutes prior to intubation to saturate the cuff membrane. The incidence of sore throat was significantly different at the 24-hour evaluation (59% air vs. 32% lidocaine, p = 0.01).</s><s>We sought to evaluate the effect of filling an endotracheal tube cuff with 40 mg lidocaine alone (Group L) or alkalinized lidocaine (Group LB) in comparison to an Air Control group (Group C) on adverse emergence phenomena in a randomized controlled study (n = 25 in each group). The difference between Group L and Group C remained significant in the two postextubation hours only. This approach also decreases hemodynamic effects, restlessness, dysphonia, and hoarseness.</s><s>A randomized, double-blind study was carried out on 193 ASA I-II surgical patients to assess the effect of aerosolized lidocaine on sore throat, hoarseness and cough in connection with tracheal intubation. The patients were interviewed when leaving the recovery room and the next day in the ward.</s><s>We sought to determine the benefits of using alkalinized lidocaine 40 mg to fill the cuff of a tracheal tube (ETT) in combination with water-soluble gel lubrication to prevent post-intubation sore throat. The work included an in vitro study of the diffusion of alkalinized lidocaine solution through the low-pressure, high-volume cuff of an ETT. We also performed a randomized controlled study (n=20 patients in each group) that included a group who received an alkalinized lidocaine-filled ETT cuff with lubrication of the tube using water-soluble gel (Group G), and two control groups who received an alkalinized lidocaine-filled cuff with ETT lubrication with water (Group W) or an air-filled cuff with ETT lubrication with water (Group C). After extubation, nausea, vomiting, dysphonia and hoarseness were greater for patients with air-filled cuffs compared with the lidocaine-filled cuffs. No significant difference between the groups was recorded in arterial blood pressure and heart rate.</s><s>When alkalinized lidocaine instead of air is used to fill the endotracheal tube (ETT) cuff, coughing, and bucking are decreased during extubation when ventilation is controlled with N2O. After pH determination of different solutions (2 mL of 2% L-HCl and 2 to 6 mL of 8.4%, or 1.4% NaHCO3), an in vitro lidocaine diffusion through the ETT cuffs was evaluated (2 mL of 2% L-HCl and 3 mL of 8.4% or 1.4% NaHCO3). Then, adult patients scheduled for total thyroidectomy surgery were consecutively enrolled (n = 20 for each group). Hoarseness, bucking, dysphonia, dysphagia, cough, restlessness, and postoperative nausea and vomiting were also evaluated. Compared with group air, the alkalinized-lidocaine groups had a significant reduction in sore throat during the 24-h postoperative period (P < 0.0001). The difference was not significant between the two alkalinized lidocaine groups. No laryngospasm, rupture of ETT cuff, or depression of the swallowing reflex were recorded. A decrease in sore throat during the postoperative period was recorded when the cuff was inflated with a small dose of alkalinized lidocaine (i.e., 40 mg of L-HCl and 1.4% of NaHCO3) rather than with air when ventilation was controlled without N2O.</s><s>Postoperative sore throat: effect of lidocaine jelly and pomade on endotracheal intubation.</s><s>Laryngo-tracheal lidocaine spray before intubation is associated with an increased risk of postoperative throat problems. Sore throat and dysphagia were significantly more severe after lidocaine spray was used than after lidocaine or placebo was used. However, there was no significant difference in the incidence or severity of postoperative sore throat, hoarseness or dysphagia between the lidocaine group and the placebo group throughout the study. Therefore, lidocaine spray should be avoided to prevent these unnecessary complications.</s><s>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects (common haemodynamic variables, peak cuff pressures, the incidence of reaction ('bucking') during extubation and the incidence of sore throat after operation) of lidocaine 10% instilled into the endotracheal tube cuff in intubated patients. The incidence and severity of sore throat were significantly lower in group L 1 and 24-h after extubation. Lidocaine was also effective in reducing of incidence and severity of sore throat after operation.</s><s>The study was designed to investigate the changes in pressure and volume of a tracheal tube-cuff inflated with air, mixture of N2O + O2, saline and 4% lidocaine during nitrous oxide anesthesia.</s><s>We investigated whether intravenous lidocaine prior to endotracheal intubation influences the postoperative airway symptoms of sore throat, cough, and sputum. After ethics committee approval, 80 patients undergoing elective operations were studied. A total of 20 patients were given lidocaine 1.0 mg.kg(-1) (group L1), 20 patients were given lidocaine 1.5 mg.kg(-1) (group L2), and 40 patients received normal saline (group C). In conclusion, intravenous lidocaine prior to endotracheal intubation decreased the incidence of postoperative sore throat and cough.</s><s>Postoperative sore throat occurs in up to 90% of intubated patients and is the most common complaint of patients after endotracheal intubation. The purpose of this prospective randomized study was to compare the incidence and severity of sore throat after using lidocaine, saline, or air to inflate the endotracheal tube cuff. The participants were all ASA physical status I, II, or III, female, adult patients undergoing general endotracheal anesthesia for gynecological procedures. Lidocaine, saline, and air had similar effects on postoperative sore throat.</s><s>High intracuff pressure in endotracheal tubes (ETs) may cause tracheal lesions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of endotracheal tube cuffs filled with air or with alkalinized lidocaine. This was a prospective clinical study at the Department of Anesthesiology, Faculdade de Medicina de Botucatu, Universidade Estadual Paulista. The patients were randomly allocated to two groups: Air, with ET cuff inflated with air to attain a cuff pressure of 20 cmH2O; and Lido, with ET cuff filled with 2% lidocaine plus 8.4% sodium bicarbonate to attain the same pressure. Tracheal complaints were similar for the two groups, except for lower ET discomfort and sore throat incidence after 24 hours and lower systolic arterial pressure at the time of extubation in the Lido group (p < 0.05). Thus, alkalinized lidocaine-filled ET cuffs seem to be safer than conventional air-filled ET cuffs.</s><s>To evaluate the efficacy of various ways of lidocaine application in reducing postoperative cough and sore throat. 204 ASA physical status I and II patients scheduled for cataract surgery with general anesthesia. In the G3 group, the distal ends of the ETTs were lubricated with 2% lidocaine jelly. In the recovery room, 64.4% of the patients experienced cough, with greatest frequency in the G3, G6, and G2 groups, and the least in the G5 and G4 groups. Using lidocaine to inflate the ETT cuff or IV lidocaine at the end of surgery decreases the frequency of postoperative cough and sore throat and would provide better outcome for patients and the physician.</s>"

The patient population was representative for the disease as it ordinarily appears in medical outpatient clinics. Improvement or remission was seen in 77% of the 5-aminosalicylic acid-treated patients and in 72% of the prednisolone-treated patients (P greater than 0.05).

Mean disease activity index declined 55% for patients on 5-aminosalicylic acid and 24% for patients on placebo (p = 0.0001). Rapid onset of efficacy was shown by a significant reduction in rectal bleeding within 3 days of treatment initiation.</s><s>5-Aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) is the active component of Salazopyrin and induces a prompt and excellent improvement, when administered as high dosage enema, in patients suffering from active ulcerative colitis. However, the high instability of this metabolite makes its large use difficult. We aimed at finding a more stable preparation and therefore wondered whether another similar molecule, i.e. In the group of the 31 patients treated with 4-ASA, 24 (77%) improved clinically, 24 (77%) sigmoidoscopically and 13 (41%) histologically. Since no difference was registered between the two types of treatment (p = 0.141, X2 test), 4-ASA could be a possible form of treatment for active ulcerative colitis.</s><s>To compare the efficacy and safety of mesalamine (5-ASA) suspension enema versus oral sulfasalazine (SAS) in patients with active mild to moderate distal ulcerative colitis. Safety was assessed by adverse event reports, clinical laboratory tests, and physical examination. Mean DAI scores indicated significant improvement from baseline in both treatment groups. PGI ratings showed more improvement in the 5-ASA treatment group than in the SAS group at wk 2 (p = 0.02) and at wk 4 (p = 0.04). Rectally administered 5-ASA is as effective as oral SAS in treatment of active distal ulcerative colitis but is associated with fewer and milder adverse events. Patients treated with 5-ASA reported improvement earlier than those treated with SAS.</s><s>Rectally administered mesalazine (5-aminosalicylic acid) is a recognized therapy for distal ulcerative colitis. Patients with active distal ulcerative colitis, diagnosed according to standardized criteria, were treated for 4 weeks.

In a multicenter investigator-blind trial, 375 patients with mild-to-moderate UC were randomized to receive mesalamine foam 1 g/80 mL/day or mesalamine liquid enema 1 g/100 mL/day for 4 wk (W). Primary end point was clinical remission at W4 defined as a CAI 1-4 < or = 2. Noninferiority of the foam to liquid enema was declared if the lower limit of the 97.5% unilateral confidence interval (97.5% CI) of the difference in remission rates between foam and liquid enema groups was greater than -15% . Remission rates at W4 in foam versus liquid were 68.3%versus 73.6% in per protocol (PP) population (lower limit of 97.5% CI -15.1%) and 66.7%versus 70.5% in intention-to-treat (ITT) population (97.5% CI -13.4%).</s><s>5-Aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), the presumed active moiety of sulfasalazine, has shown clinical efficacy when administered per rectum as initial therapy to patients with distal ulcerative colitis.

No adverse events attributed to the study drugs were recorded in either of the groups.</s><s>5-Aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), the active moiety of sulphasalazine (SASP), was given as a rectal enema to patients with mild to moderate distal ulcerative colitis to determine the minimum effective dosage. One hundred and thirteen patients with ulcerative colitis attending our outpatient clinic volunteered to participate. Clinical, sigmoidoscopic, and histological assessments were carried out at the beginning of the study and after 15 and 30 days of treatment.

Symptom grading, sigmoidoscopic appearance, rectal biopsy specimens, and diary records were used to assess benefit and side effects. The active drug conferred significant benefit compared with placebo as shown by several criteria, but this benefit was confined to patients not already taking sulphasalazine by mouth.</s><s>Twenty-nine patients with attacks of distal ulcerative colitis were treated randomly with 3 g 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) or 30 mg of prednisolone phosphate sodium (PP) enemas (40 ml).</s><s>The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of mesalamine rectal suspension enema (Rowasa) alone, oral mesalamine tablets (Asacol) alone, and the combination of mesalamine enema and mesalamine tablets in patients with active mild-to-moderate distal ulcerative colitis. Sixty outpatients with ulcerative colitis at least 5 cm above the anal verge and not more than 50 cm, inclusive, and a total disease activity index (DAI) score between 4 and 10, inclusive, were randomized to either mesalamine rectal enema (n = 18) once nightly, oral mesalamine 2.4 g/day (n = 22), or a combination of both treatments (n = 20). Total DAI scores and abbreviated DAI scores were evaluated at wk 3 and 6, and wk 1 and 2, respectively. Physicians' and patients' ratings of improvement indicated that combination therapy significantly improved disease status, compared with mesalamine tablet therapy alone. The combination of oral and rectal mesalamine therapy was well tolerated and produced earlier and more complete relief of rectal bleeding than oral or rectal therapy alone.</s><s>A defence of the small clinical trial: evaluation of three gastroenterological studies.</s><s>Rectally administered mesalazine (mesalamine; 5-aminosalicylic acid) is the first-line therapy for treatment of distal ulcerative colitis. Recently, a high-volume 5-aminosalicylic acid foam has been shown to be as effective and safe as standard 5-aminosalicylic acid enema. 330 patients were evaluable for efficacy and safety by intention-to-treat, 290 for per-protocol analysis. The low-volume foam was associated with a lower frequency of severe discomfort, pain and retention problems. Low-volume 5-aminosalicylic acid foam is as effective and safe as a high-volume 5-aminosalicylic acid foam in the treatment of active distal ulcerative colitis, but offers compliance advantages compared to the high-volume preparation.</s><s>We evaluated the efficacy, tolerance, and acceptance of a new 5-ASA colonic foam versus 5-ASA liquid enema in the short-term treatment of active ulcerative colitis in a three-week prospective, randomized, investigator-blind study, enrolling 233 patients from 12 outpatient clinics in Italy. In arm 1 of the study, 117 patients with mild attacks received 2 g of 5-ASA as foam or enema at bedtime. End points were defined as complete relief of symptoms, and endoscopic and histological evidence of remission or improvement. In patients with moderate relapse, a higher proportion of patients achieved complete clinical remission in the foam group (63%) compared with enema group (52%) after three weeks (difference 11%, 95% CI -7 to 29). No significant differences were observed in endoscopic and histological evaluation of colonic mucosa between treatment groups in either arm.</s><s>Rectal formulations of mesalazine are the treatment of choice in mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. A new foam formulation of mesalazine was developed to improve both drug delivery and patient acceptance. Disease activity was monitored on the basis of the Clinical Activity Index, Endoscopic Index, Histological Index, and global efficacy assessment by the investigators. Similarly, 59% of patients receiving mesalazine but only 41% of those receiving placebo showed an improved Histological Index. The foam enemas were generally well-tolerated, and no treatment-related changes on laboratory variables and vital signs were noted. Mesalazine foam enema was well-tolerated and was more effective than placebo in the treatment of patients with distal ulcerative colitis.</s><s>Alicaforsen is an antisense oligonucleotide inhibitor of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 protein expression with activity in subjects with ulcerative colitis and pouchitis. Subjects received a nightly enema of 120 mg alicaforsen (n=55), 240 mg alicaforsen (n=50), or 4 g mesalazine (n=54) for 6 weeks, followed by a 24-week monitoring period. No significant difference was observed between treatment arms in the primary end point. However, the median duration of response to alicaforsen enema treatment was two- to threefold longer (128 and 146 days) in comparison with mesalazine (54 days). Alicaforsen enema demonstrated an acute response and safety profile similar to mesalazine enema, but was differentiated by a more durable response.</s><s>Topical beclomethasone diproprionate has shown efficacy in ulcerative colitis. In 15 referral gastrointestinal units, 99 patients with distal ulcerative colitis were enrolled. This number was lower than planned according to the statistical analysis, due to a low recruitment rate. The efficacy was assessed by comparing the Disease Activity Index value at T4 and T8 by using the Student's t-test or the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. The Disease Activity Index lowered at T4 and T8 versus T0 in the four groups (T4 versus T0: beclomethasone diproprionate foam Disease Activity Index 2 versus 6 p<0.0001; beclomethasone diproprionate enema 4 versus 6, mesalazine enema 3 versus 6, mesalazine foam 3.5 versus 7, p<0.001 for all three groups; T8 versus T0: p<0.01).</s><s>A new mesalazine rectal gel preparation (without propellant gas) has been recently developed to improve topical treatment in distal ulcerative colitis. To evaluate the efficacy, safety and patient tolerability of mesalazine gel enema compared with mesalazine foam enema in the treatment of patients with acute left-sided ulcerative colitis. In a randomized multicentre investigator-blind parallel group trial, 103 patients with mild to moderate left-sided colitis or proctosigmoiditis were randomly allocated to mesalazine 2 g gel enema (n = 50 evaluable patients) and mesalazine 2 g foam enema (n = 53 evaluable patients) for 4 weeks. Patients' evaluation of treatment tolerability and acceptability was assessed at 2 and 4 weeks. Endoscopic remission rates at week 4 were 51 and 52% for the mesalazine gel and foam enemas, respectively (P = 0.925). Patients reported that the new mesalazine gel preparation was significantly better tolerated than the foam enema.</s><s>The aim of our study was to compare the efficacy and safety of oral mesalazine with mesalazine suppositories in patients with active ulcerative proctitis. Efficacy evaluations included a disease activity index, which represents a score with four variables: stools frequency, rectal bleeding, mucosal appearance, and physician's assessment of disease severity. Safety assessment included clinical laboratory parameters and adverse event reports. There were no significant differences with regard to baseline comparisons of demographics and severity between the two treatment groups. The rate of histologic remission was significantly greater with suppositories compared with tablets both at two and four weeks (P < 0.01).</s><s>are a safe and effective treatment for patients with ulcerative proctitis or distal proctosigmoiditis. After 4 weeks, clinical and sigmoidoscopic remission were observed, respectively, in 84 and 76% of patients treated with Pentasa suppositories, and in 80 and 72% of patients treated with Claversal suppositories 500 mg b.d. Pentasa 1 g suppository once daily induces a quicker clinical and sigmoidoscopic remission, and was better tolerated, than the Claversal 500 mg suppository b.d., and it may represent an advance for the topical treatment of distal proctosigmoiditis.</s><s>Multi-matrix (MMx), a new delivery system for mesalazine, seems to release 5-aminosalicyclic acid (5-ASA) preferentially in the sigmoid colon. The primary endpoint was clinical remission (clinical activity index < or =4) at 8 weeks. Clinical remission rates at 4 and 8 weeks were 57.5% and 60.0% for patients treated with MMx and 68.4% and 50.0% for patients randomized to 5-ASA enemas, respectively (95% confidence interval for the difference at 8 weeks, -12 to +32). Endoscopic remission was achieved by 45.0% of patients on 5-ASA MMx and by 36.8% of those on enema, whereas 15.0% and 8% of patients, respectively, showed histologic remission.</s><s>Mesalazine enemas are of well proven efficacy for the topical treatment of distal ulcerative colitis. Patients were randomly assigned to receive, in open-label fashion, either mesalazine foam 2 g twice a day or mesalazine enema (2 g/60 ml twice a day) for 3 weeks. Patients who did not achieve remission (defined as CAI <4 and EI <6) after 3 weeks continued the study receiving the alternative galenic formulation for a further 3 weeks. Characteristics at baseline were similar except for concomitant therapy with oral 5-ASA products: during the 1st treatment phase, 41% of patients on enema received such treatment vs only 29% of those on foam. Patients with at least one post-treatment efficacy evaluation were included in the intent-to-treat analysis (n=89 foam, n=96 enema). Two patients discontinued treatment with foam prematurely due to anal burning. Salofalk foam and enema are equally effective for the treatment of proctitis, proctosigmoiditis and left-sided ulcerative colitis. The new foam preparation is as well tolerated and accepted as enemas and can be used as a therapeutic alternative to conventional mesalazine enema formulations.</s><s>Distal ulcerative colitis can be treated with oral or rectal mesalazine, or both. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mesalazine foam enemas compared with prednisolone foam enemas in the treatment of patients with acute distal ulcerative colitis. A randomised multicentre investigator blind parallel group trial was conducted. There was a trend in favour of more patients in the mesalazine group achieving sigmoidoscopic remission (40% v 31%, p = 0.10). Histological remission was achieved by 27% and 21% of patients receiving mesalazine and prednisolone respectively. Prednisolone treated patients had significantly fewer days with liquid stools than mesalazine patients, with a median of 0 and 1 days respectively by week 4 (p = 0.001).</s><s>Patients with active distal proctitis received either 5-aminosalicylic (5-ASA) acid or identical placebo suppositories, 500 mg t.i.d. Activity at 3 and 6 wks was assessed using a Disease Activity Index (DAI), derived from four categories: number of daily evacuations more than usual, evacuations containing blood, sigmoidoscopy appearance, and physician's overall assessment. Of the 14 patients, with initial mean DAI 7.1 +/- 1.8, 11 were in complete remission at 6 wks (78.6%). An additional 6 patients with inflammatory bowel disease and 6 healthy volunteers were given 99mTc-labelled 5-aminosalicylic acid suppositories. The extent of spread was limited to the rectum, and the suppositories were retained for 3 hours.</s><s>Sixty patients with active distal ulcerative colitis participated in a multicentre randomized double-blind trial to compare the effect of a beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) enema (3 mg/100 ml) with 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) enemas (2 g/ 100 ml) and enemas with a combination of BDP/5-ASA (3 mg/2 g/100 ml). Two patients on 5-ASA and three on BDP had a marked deterioration during treatment. The combination of BDP and 5-ASA was significantly superior to single-agent therapy in terms of both improved sigmoidoscopic and improved histological score. However, combination therapy with BDP/5-ASA seems superior to single-agent therapy and causes no adverse reactions.</s><s>A multicentre double-blind study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of 1 g or 1.5 g mesalazine daily compared with placebo in 94 patients with mild to moderate distal proctosigmoiditis (less than 20 cm). The study end point was the determination of clinical, endoscopic, and histologic remission rates at 4 weeks.</s><s>Sixty-two patients with ulcerative colitis localised to the distal sigmoid colon and rectum (less than 20 cm) entered the trial.

Among patients who received noninvasive ventilation, the probability of survival and weaning during ventilation was higher (P = 0.002) and time in the intensive care unit was shorter (15.1+/-5.4 days compared with 24.0+/-13.7 days for patients who received invasive ventilation; P = 0.005). Survival rates at 60 days differed (92% for patients who received noninvasive ventilation and 72% for patients who received invasive ventilation; P = 0.009). Noninvasive pressure support ventilation during weaning reduces weaning time, shortens the time in the intensive care unit, decreases the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia, and improves 60-day survival rates.</s><s>Prolonged duration of endotracheal mechanical ventilation (ETMV) is associated with an increased morbidity and mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) as a systematic extubation and weaning technique to reduce the duration of ETMV in acute-on-chronic respiratory failure (ACRF). Conventional invasive pressure support ventilation (IPSV) was used as the control weaning technique in 16 patients (IPSV group), and NIV was applied immediately after extubation in 17 patients (NIV group). In the IPSV group, 12 of 16 patients (75%) were successfully weaned and extubated, versus 13 of 17 (76.5%) in the NIV group (p = NS). The duration of ETMV was significantly shorter in the NIV (4.56 +/- 1.85 d) than in the IPSV group (7.69 +/- 3.79 d) (p = 0. In conclusion, NIV permits earlier removal of the endotracheal tube than with conventional IPSV, and reduces the duration of daily ventilatory support without increasing the risk of weaning failures.</s><s>To evaluate the application of sequential noninvasive following invasive mechanical ventilation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with severe respiratory failure by investigating the appearance of pulmonary-infection-control-window. When the pulmonary infection was significantly controlled (the time of pulmonary infection control was called PIC window) by the antibiotic and comprehensive therapy, all cases were randomized into noninvasive veatiation group (NIV) and control group. Conventional invasive synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) plus pressure support ventilation (PSV) was used as the weaning technique in the control group. Thirty eight cases among 76 patients were in the NIV group, and the rest in the control group. The time of PIC window was (7.5 +/- 1.9) d in the NIV group, and (8.0 +/- 2.5) d in the control group (P > 0.05). The durations of RICU stay and hospital stay were shorter than that in the control group. The incidence of ventilation associated pneumonia (VAP) was 18.4% (7/38) in the NIV group, 39.5% (15/38) in the control group respectively (P < 0.05).</s><s>Early withdraw from invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) followed by noninvasive MV is a new strategy for changing modes of treatment. Ninety intubated COPD patients with severe hypercapnic respiratory failure triggered by pulmonary infection (pneumonia or purulent bronchitis) were involved in the study. When the pulmonary infection had been controlled by antibiotics and comprehensive therapy, the \"pulmonary infection control window (PIC window)\" has been reached. Each case was randomly assigned to study group (extubation and noninvasive MV via facial mask immediately) or control group (invasive MV was received continuously after PIC window by using conventional weaning technique). Compared with control group, study group had shorter duration of invasive MV [(6.4 +/- 4.4) days vs (11.3 +/- 6.2) days, P = 0.000], lower rate of ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) (3/47 vs 12/43, P = 0.014), fewer days in ICU [(12 +/- 8) days vs (16 +/- 11) days, P = 0.047] and lower hospital mortality (1/47 vs 7/43, P = 0.025).</s>"

Sixty-one patients admitted between May 2000 and March 2002 in the intensive care units of two hospitals in France were randomized to one of three groups: control, HF (200 ml/kg/h over 8 h) or HF+HT (32 degrees C for 24 h) induced by cooling the HF substitution fluid. The six-month survival curves of the three groups were significantly different, with better survival in the HF group (p = 0.026) and in the HF+HT group (p = 0.018). Combination of HF with mild HT is feasible and should be evaluated in larger trials.</s><s>Studies in laboratory animals suggest that hypothermia induced shortly after the restoration of spontaneous circulation may improve neurologic outcome, but there have been no conclusive studies in humans. In a randomized, controlled trial, we compared the effects of moderate hypothermia and normothermia in patients who remained unconscious after resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The primary outcome measure was survival to hospital discharge with sufficiently good neurologic function to be discharged to home or to a rehabilitation facility. The demographic characteristics of the patients were similar in the hypothermia and normothermia groups. Twenty-one of the 43 patients treated with hypothermia (49 percent) survived and had a good outcome--that is, they were discharged home or to a rehabilitation facility--as compared with 9 of the 34 treated with normothermia (26 percent, P=0.046).</s>"

In 13 patients aged 24 years at baseline, we evaluated blood pressure, kidney biopsies and kidney function tests at baseline and after 5 years of treatment. Two patients in the placebo group needed antihypertensive treatment because they developed microalbuminuria and/or hypertension, but no patient in the candesartan group did. A significant reduction in mesangial matrix volume and mesangial volume occurred in the candesartan group, although changes in morphological parameters were similar between groups.</s><s>To assess and compare the long-term effects of the combination of candesartan and lisinopril with high-dose lisinopril on systolic blood pressure in patients with hypertension and diabetes. This was a prospective, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, double-dummy study with a 12-month follow-up. Drug therapy was either lisinopril 40 mg once daily or dual-blockade treatment with candesartan 16 mg once daily and lisinopril 20 mg once daily. The study comprised 75 type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients aged 35-74 years.</s><s>Nephropathy and retinopathy remain important complications of type 1 diabetes. The primary end point was a change in the fraction of glomerular volume occupied by mesangium in kidney-biopsy specimens. The retinopathy end point was a progression on a retinopathy severity scale of two steps or more. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed with the use of linear regression and logistic-regression models. Change in mesangial fractional volume per glomerulus over the 5-year period did not differ significantly between the placebo group (0.016 units) and the enalapril group (0.005, P=0.38) or the losartan group (0.026, P=0.26), nor were there significant treatment benefits for other biopsy-assessed renal structural variables. There were three biopsy-related serious adverse events that completely resolved. Early blockade of the renin-angiotensin system in patients with type 1 diabetes did not slow nephropathy progression but slowed the progression of retinopathy.</s><s>Renal disease in people with insulin-dependent diabetes (IDDM) continues to pose a major health threat. We carried out a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the ACE inhibitor lisinopril in 530 men and women with IDDM aged 20-59 years with normoalbuminuria or microalbuminuria. Patients were recruited from 18 European centres, and were not on medication for hypertension. Resting blood pressure at entry was at least 75 and no more than 90 mm Hg diastolic, and no more than 155 mm Hg systolic. There were no difference in baseline characteristics by treatment group; mean AER was 8.0 micrograms/min in both groups; and prevalence of microalbuminuria was 13% and 17% in the placebo and lisinopril groups, respectively. For patients who completed 24 months on the trial, the final treatment difference in AER was 38.5 micrograms/min in those with microalbuminuria at baseline (p = 0.001), and 0.23 microgram/min in those with normoalbuminuria at baseline (p = 0.6). Our results show that lisinopril does not increase the risk of hypoglycaemic events in IDDM.</s><s>Angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) blunt progression of advanced diabetic nephropathy, but their long-term renal effects in other patients are not clear.

Among the telmisartan and placebo groups, 7 and 10 patients had dialysis and 56 and 36 patients had doubling of serum creatinine, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.59 [CI, 1.04 to 2.41]; P = 0.031). Albuminuria increased less with telmisartan than with placebo (32% [CI, 23% to 41%] vs. 63% [CI, 52% to 76%]; P < 0.001).

A total of 75 patients enrolled in this study presented stable type 2 diabetes (not treated with insulin) and mild-to-moderate hypertension with a left ventricular mass > or = 75 g/m2 by two-dimensional echocardiography. After a 4-week washout period, 38 patients were assigned to treatment with captopril, and 37 patients to nitrendipine (random allocation). Both drugs were equally effective in reducing systolic and diastolic blood pressure (captopril: from 165 +/- 13/100 +/- 4 to 147 +/- 11/87 +/- 4 mmHg; nitrendipine: from 167 +/- 17/100 +/- 5 to 143 +/- 9/86 +/- 4 mmHg; P < 0.05) and in reversing LVH (nitrendipine: from 87 +/- 2 to 81 +/- 1 g/m2; captopril: from 89 +/- 2 to 85 +/- 2 g/m2; P = 0.0001). Neither the left ventricular end-diastolic volume index nor the left ventricular ejection fraction changed significantly during the treatment period.</s><s>Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are known to reduce proteinuria. Their combination might be more effective than either treatment alone, but long-term data for comparative changes in renal function are not available. We investigated the renal effects of ramipril (an ACE inhibitor), telmisartan (an ARB), and their combination in patients aged 55 years or older with established atherosclerotic vascular disease or with diabetes with end-organ damage. After a 3-week run-in period, 25 620 participants were randomly assigned to ramipril 10 mg a day (n=8576), telmisartan 80 mg a day (n=8542), or to a combination of both drugs (n=8502; median follow-up was 56 months), and renal function and proteinuria were measured. The primary renal outcome was a composite of dialysis, doubling of serum creatinine, and death. The secondary renal outcome, dialysis or doubling of serum creatinine, was similar with telmisartan (189 [2.21%]) and ramipril (174 [2.03%]; HR 1.09, 0.89-1.34) and more frequent with combination therapy (212 [2.49%]: HR 1.24, 1.01-1.51, p=0.038). Although combination therapy reduces proteinuria to a greater extent than monotherapy, overall it worsens major renal outcomes.</s><s>The effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme lisinopril were compared with those of the calcium antagonist nifedipine in 162 non-insulin-dependent diabetic hypertensive patients for a 24-week period. In 83 and 79 patients, respectively, lisinopril and slow-release nifedipine produced similar reductions in blood pressure (systolic/diastolic: -16/-13 mmHg supine and -14/-11 mmHg standing after lisinopril; -15/-12 mmHg supine and -14/-11 mmHg standing nifedipine). Fasting and post-prandial plasma glucose, glycosylated haemoglobin and plasma lipids appeared to be unaffected by either agent. Moreover, lisinopril appeared to be better tolerated than nifedipine in our study population. Finally, both lisinopril and nifedipine showed a similar antihypertensive effect in these patients which was not associated with significant differences in plasma glucose, insulin or lipid concentrations. The clinical consequences of the insignificant differences in AER remain unclear.</s><s>The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of losartan on blood pressure (BP), creatinine clearance (Ccr) and urinary albumin excretion (UAE), and to assess metabolic parameters in comparison with ACEI. Thirty-three type 2 diabetic hypertensive patients were enrolled in the study. Twenty patients were randomized to receive 50 mg/day losartan and 13 patients to 10 mg/day fosinopril. In the subgroup with microalbuminuria at baseline, UAE rate was lower in both groups at the end of the 1st and 6th months. In conclusion, this study confirms the efficacy and safety of losartan as an antihypertensive drug in diabetic patients.</s><s>To compare the long-term antihypertensive efficacy, tolerability, and metabolic effects of prazosin GITS and enalapril. Sufficient number of patients recruited so that at least 60 complete the entire study. Forty-Eight patients randomized to prazosin GITS group and 41 to enalapril group. Of these, 31 in prazosin GITS group (M 19, F 12; mean age-53.4 yr, SEM 1.68) and 29 in enalapril group (M17, F 12; mean age-54.7 yr, SEM 1.64) completed the entire study. Percent patients with DBP < 90 mm Hg at 24 weeks: prazosin GITS--71.0%, enalapril--72.4%; SBP < 140 mm Hg: prazosin GITS--54.8%, enalapril--55.2; both DBP < 90 mm Hg and SBP < 140 mm Hg: prazosin GITS--54.8%, enalapril--44.8%; percent patients with DBP fall of 10 mm Hg or more at 24 weeks: prazosin GITS--77.4%, enalapril--72.4%. Treatment with prazosin GITS resulted in a favourable effect on serum triglycerides at the end of 8 weeks (p = 0.017) and 16 weeks (p = 0.011), and no detrimental effect or a marginal beneficial effect on total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol. Neither drug had any effect on glycosylated hemoglobin and 12-hr urinary microalbuminuria. Adverse events probably or definitely related to the drug: prazosin GITS--2 of 44 patients (4.5%), enalapril--6 of 39 patients (15.4%). In the doses used, prazosin GITS showed comparable antihypertensive efficacy to enalapril.</s><s>Long-term effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and metabolic control in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients. In hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is associated with a lower incidence of cardiovascular events than those treated with calcium channel-blocking agents. However, the long-term renal effects of ACE inhibitors in these patients remain inconclusive. In 1989, we commenced a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study to examine the anti-albuminuric effects of enalapril versus nifedipine (slow release) in 102 hypertensive, type 2 diabetic patients. These patients have been followed up for a mean trial duration of 5.5 +/- 2.2 years. We examined the determinants, including the effect of ACE inhibition on clinical outcomes in these patients. Renal function was shown by the 24-hour UAE, creatinine clearance (CCr), and the regression coefficient of the yearly plasma creatinine reciprocal (beta-1/Cr). Compared with the normoalbuminuric and microalbuminuric patients, those with macroalbuminuria had the lowest mean CCr (75.5 +/- 24.1 vs. 63.5 +/- 21.3 vs. 41.9 +/- 18.5 mL/min, P < 0.001) and the highest frequency of clinical events (4.7 vs. 5.9 vs. 52%, P < 0. Treatment with enalapril was associated with a greater reduction in albuminuria than with nifedipine in the entire patient group, and especially in those with microalbuminuria.</s><s>Although several important studies have been performed in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients, it is not known whether lowering blood pressure in normotensive (BP <140/90 mm Hg) patients offers any beneficial results on vascular complications. The subjects were randomized to intensive (10 mm Hg below the baseline DBP) versus moderate (80 to 89 mm Hg) DBP control. Mean BP in the intensive group was 128 +/- 0.8/75 +/- 0.3 mm Hg versus 137 +/- 0.7/81 +/- 0.3 mm Hg in the moderate group, P < 0.0001. Although no difference was demonstrated in creatinine clearance (P = 0.43), a lower percentage of patients in the intensive group progressed from normoalbuminuria to microalbuminuria (P = 0.012) and microalbuminuria to overt albuminuria (P = 0.028). Over a five-year follow-up period, intensive (approximately 128/75 mm Hg) BP control in normotensive type 2 diabetic patients: (1) slowed the progression to incipient and overt diabetic nephropathy; (2) decreased the progression of diabetic retinopathy; and (3) diminished the incidence of stroke.</s><s>Contrasting information has been reported concerning the course of renal function in NIDDM with hypertension alone or in association with renal damage. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the course of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in hypertensive NIDDM patients during antihypertensive therapy. The target of antihypertensive treatment was a value < 140 mmHg for systolic and 85 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure (BP). A significant decrease was observed in the values of GFR, AER, and systolic and diastolic BP in normoalbuminuric and microalbuminuric patients during antihypertensive therapy. The GFR fall in the overall population of NIDDM patients was significantly and inversely related to the decrease of mean BP (diastolic + 1/3 pulse pressure) (r = -0.80, P < 0.0001) but not to that of HbA1c, triglycerides, and BMI. The GFR decline (mean +/- SE) per year in the normoalbuminuric patient was 2.03 +/- 0.66 ml.min-1 x 1.73 m-2 (95% CI 0.92-3.17) during cilazapril and 2.01 +/- 0.71 ml.min-1 x 1.73 m-2 (95% CI 0.82-3.11) during amlodipine therapy. Cilazapril and amlodipine lowered AER to a similar extent in normoalbuminuric and microalbuminuric patients. No significant changes were observed concerning other clinical and biochemical features between the two antihypertensive therapies and particularly HbA1c, BMI, triglycerides, and cholesterol plasma values.</s><s>Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors attenuate the decline in renal function in diabetic patients with microalbuminuria. However, no data are available on the use of ACE inhibitors to prevent the decrease in renal function in normotensive, normoalbuminuric patients with type 2 diabetes. Eight outpatient clinics coordinated by a department of medicine in a university hospital. Degree of albuminuria at 24 hours, creatinine clearance, blood pressure, and hemoglobin A1c values. In the placebo group, albumin excretion increased from 10.8 +/- 8 mg/24 h to 26.5 +/- 10 mg/24 h at 6 years (P = 0.001 for enalapril compared with placebo). Further research is needed to determine whether this treatment forestalls the development of overt nephropathy.</s><s>Diabetes is the most common cause of renal failure in the United States, and data regarding the effects of aggressive blood pressure (BP) therapy in normotensive patients with type 2 diabetes are inadequate. A total of 129 type 2 diabetic patients with a BP of <140/80 to 90 mm Hg without overt albuminuria were randomized to either intensive BP control (diastolic BP goal 75 mm Hg) using an angiotensin II receptor blocker, valsartan, versus moderate BP control (diastolic BP 80 to 90 mm Hg with placebo initially) to evaluate the effect on the change in urinary albumin excretion (UAE) from baseline. During the follow-up period, the mean BP was 118 +/- 10.9/75 +/- 5.7 for the intensive v 124 10.9/80 6.5 mm Hg for the moderate BP groups (P < .001). No difference was observed in change in creatinine clearance or serum creatinine from baseline between the two groups.</s><s>BP is an important determinant of kidney disease among patients with diabetes. Effects of active treatment were consistent across subgroups defined by baseline systolic or diastolic BP. Lower systolic BP levels during follow-up, even to <110 mmHg, was associated with progressively lower rates of renal events. In conclusion, BP-lowering treatment with perindopril-indapamide administered routinely to individuals with type 2 diabetes provides important renoprotection, even among those with initial BP <120/70 mmHg.</s><s>To study the effect of lisinopril on the exercise-induced urinary albumin excretion rate. A total of 26 IDDM patients with normoalbuminuria were randomized into two groups, with one group receiving placebo (n = 13, age 36 +/- 3 years, BMI 24.5 +/- 1.1 kg/m2) and the other group receiving an average of 15 mg lisinopril daily (n = 13, age 34 +/- 2 years, BMI 24.4 +/- 0.9 kg/m2). In the lisinopril group, the exercise-induced urinary albumin excretion rate diminished 46% after the 1st year (P = 0.059) and 66% (P < 0.01) after the 2nd year. The dBP decreased significantly at 1 and 2 years in the lisinopril group, while there was no significant change in the sBP. Lisinopril treatment reduces the exercise-induced urinary albumin excretion rate in such patients. These data suggest a protective effect of lisinopril against the development of microalbuminuria.</s><s>Diabetic nephropathy is one of the leading causes of end-stage renal disease. We examined whether ACE inhibitor treatment may have a nephroprotective effect in normotensive insulin-dependent diabetic patients without microalbuminuria and with normal glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and whether any effect was associated with the ACE genotype. Urine albumine/creatinine ratio (ACR), mean blood pressure (MBP) and index of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) based on S-creatinine were determined. During treatment, a significant increase in ACR in the placebo group (p=0.007), Wilcoxon matched paired test) was observed.</s><s>ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists may favorably affect serum lipids and glucose metabolism. The primary aim of the Fosinopril Versus Amlodipine Cardiovascular Events Randomized Trial (FACET) was to compare the effects of fosinopril and amlodipine on serum lipids and diabetes control in NIDDM patients with hypertension. Prospectively defined cardiovascular events were assessed as secondary outcomes. Exclusion criteria included a history of coronary heart disease or stroke, serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dl, albuminuria > 40 micrograms/min, and use of lipid-lowering drugs, aspirin, or antihypertensive agents other than beta-blockers or diuretics.</s><s>Microalbuminuria is an early predictor of diabetic nephropathy and premature cardiovascular disease. We investigated whether treatment with an angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) would delay or prevent the occurrence of microalbuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes and normoalbuminuria. Additional antihypertensive drugs (except angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors or ARBs) were used as needed to lower blood pressure to less than 130/80 mm Hg. Microalbuminuria developed in 8.2% of the patients in the olmesartan group (178 of 2160 patients who could be evaluated) and 9.8% in the placebo group (210 of 2139); the time to the onset of microalbuminuria was increased by 23% with olmesartan (hazard ratio for onset of microalbuminuria, 0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.63 to 0.94; P=0.01). Olmesartan was associated with a delayed onset of microalbuminuria, even though blood-pressure control in both groups was excellent according to current standards.</s>"

Both groups continued to receive the standard service offered by the hospitals. The early follow up group were approached at 7-10 days after injury and offered additional information, advice, support, and further intervention as needed. There were no significant differences overall between the trial and control groups at follow up, but subgroup analysis of the patients with moderate or severe head injuries (posttraumatic amnesia > or = one hour, or admitted to hospital), showed that those in the early intervention group had significantly fewer difficulties with everyday activities (P = 0.03).

Intensive rehabilitation in this study speeded up recovery rather than changed the final outcome.</s><s>Of 1094 patients with a confirmed stroke admitted to Northwick Park, a district general hospital, 364 (33%) died while in hospital, 215 (20%) were fully recovered when discharged, and 329 (30%) were too frail or too ill from diseases other than stroke to be considered for active rehabilitation. Intensive was compared with conventional rehabilitation and with a third regimen which included no routine rehabilitation, but under which patients were encouraged to continue with exercises taught while in hospital and were regularly seen at home by a health visitor.

Individual randomization was not possible and randomization by hospital site was rejected because of demographic and clinical differences between sites. Group assignment was determined by a pre-specified timetable which alternated between hospitals. However, these differences did not obtain statistical significance (p > or = 0.01). Several reasons for these findings are discussed, including the novelty of the new service and methodological issues such as statistical power.</s><s>The effectiveness of ongoing rehabilitation services for postacute stroke survivors is poorly documented. We designed a randomized control, single-blinded study to demonstrate the effectiveness of intensive outpatient therapy. The treatment intervention consisted of 1 hr each of physical and occupational therapy, four times per week, for 12 wk; therapy focused on neuromuscular facilitation and functional tasks. The change from time 0 to 3 mo was significant in the treated group but not in the controls.

There were no significant differences between the groups on any of the four assessments. With the present results, both rehabilitation programmes could be recommended, however, further studies are needed to define patients who may specifically benefit from the home rehabilitation programme.</s><s>The objective was to investigate the effect of increased intensity of rehabilitation therapy provided to brain-injured subjects on the rate at which independence was regained and the duration of hospital admission. A two-centre, prospective, controlled study with random allocation to groups. Increased intensity of rehabilitation therapy input without change in content. Subjects receiving more intensive therapy made more rapid progress and were discharged home sooner. Increasing the hours per week of therapy given to adults recovering from brain injury in hospital can accelerate the rate of recovery of personal independence and result in their being discharged from hospital sooner. There is no evidence of any ceiling effect of therapeutic intensity beyond which no further response is observed.</s>"

Dose increases were permitted after 2 wk of treatment, to 150 mg/d venlafaxine and 40 mg/d fluoxetine, to optimize response. At the final visit, a statistically significantly greater efficacy of venlafaxine over fluoxetine was observed on depressive symptoms and concomitant anxiety, and 75.0 and 50.7% of patients administered venlafaxine and fluoxetine, respectively, showed an overall response. Dose increases were required by a greater percentage of patients in the fluoxetine group (52.9%), than in the venlafaxine group (37.1%), and in those patients whose dose was increased, a higher efficacy was again observed with venlafaxine.</s><s>Fluoxetine and trazodone were compared in a double-blind, randomized, parallel, 6-week trial in 43 outpatients with major depression after a 1-week single-blind placebo period. Thirty-five patients completed at least 3 weeks of active medication, while 25 patients completed all 6 weeks.

The mean scores of all depression rating scales showed that the drugs had comparable efficacy.</s><s>Fluoxetine versus nomifensine in outpatients with neurotic or reactive depressive disorder.</s><s>SSRIs (such as fluoxetine) are well known: it is, however, sure that further progress is needed and the search for antidepressants with other mechanisms of action (such as tianeptine) or different efficacy is still of interest. A multinational study compared tianeptine with fluoxetine in 387 patients with Depressive Episode, or Recurrent Depressive Disorder, or Bipolar Affective Disorder (ICD-10), in a double-blind parallel group design.

Statistically significant clinical and quality-of-life improvements from baseline were observed in both treatment groups, with no between-group differences. Utilisation of medical resources was higher in fluoxetine-treated patients, with significantly more consultations with specialists. The 2 treatment groups were similar in terms of number of hospitalisations and duration of stay, whether related to depression or not. There were no significant differences between groups for work or productivity losses.</s><s>The efficacy and tolerability of the selective reversible monoamine oxidase A inhibitor, moclobemide (300 mg/day) and the selective serotonin uptake inhibitor, fluoxetine (200 mg/day), were compared in a six-week single-centre double-blind fixed-dose study in patients (n = 42) with double depression (DSM-III-R: dysthymia with superimposed major depressive episode) using weekly assessment on the Hamilton depression rating scale (HDRS-17 items) and clinical global impression (CGI) scale. Tolerability was measured by the frequency and severity of volunteered adverse events. There were no significant differences in secondary efficacy outcome measures, but more patients achieved a > or = 50% decrease in HDRS score on moclobemide (71% vs 38%, p < 0.05). The results suggest that moclobemide and fluoxetine are equally well tolerated and at least similar in efficacy in double depression.</s><s>The response of patients with major depressive illness to fluoxetine or dothiepin was compared in a double-blind multi-centre trial. No differences in efficacy were observed, but the profile of side-effects differed with tremor, rash, nausea and headache occurring with fluoxetine, and drowsiness, dizziness and visual disturbance with dothiepin.</s><s>Fluoxetine and imipramine were compared in a six-week, double-blind, randomized trial in 118 men and women, ages 18 to 70 years, hospitalized for major depressive disorder.

Efficacy was assessed using the HAM-D and Clinical Global Impressions scale, with analyses performed on the intent-to-treat sample using the last-observation-carried-forward method. Thirty patients in the mirtazapine group and 22 in the fluoxetine group dropped out. Both drugs proved equally effective for reduction of the overall symptoms of depression throughout the treatment period. At day 42, the mean reductions in HAM-D total score (compared with baseline) were 11.8 and 10.6 for the mirtazapine and fluoxetine groups, respectively; however, the changes were not statistically significant.</s><s>The efficacy and safety of fluoxetine and desipramine were compared in a 6-week double-blind, parallel group study of patients with major depression. Twenty-five were studied while hospitalized for treatment, and 33 were studied as outpatients. Among fluoxetine-treated patients, but not desipramine-treated patients, the week 3 change in the Hamilton Depression mood item was significantly predictive of the response at 6 weeks. Desipramine, but not fluoxetine, caused a persistent increase in heart rate.

After a variable, single-blind, washout period, patients were randomized to receive either fluvoxamine (51 patients) of fluoxetine (49 patients) for 7 weeks. Efficacy was assessed with the 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), and Clinical Global Impressions scale for severity and improvement. There were no statistically significant differences observed between the two groups on any efficacy parameter. In summary, fluvoxamine and fluoxetine were equally effective in reducing depressive symptoms, but the two drugs displayed slightly different side-effect profiles.</s><s>It has been suggested that serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may be less effective than tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) in treatment of melancholic depression. Seven patients treated with doxepin and 13 patients treated with fluoxetine met diagnostic criteria for melancholic depression. Average daily dose was 169.4 +/- 41.6 mg for doxepin and 36.8 +/- 18 mg for fluoxetine. Regardless of how strict the definition of response, we found fluoxetine to be as effective as doxepin in our group of melancholic outpatients.</s><s>A large proportion of the elderly population complains of depressive symptoms. The ideal antidepressant for these patients, who often suffer from numerous concomitant diseases, should not worsen their cognitive functions and should be free of contraindications. During the study, no deterioration of cognition was observed; on the contrary, most of the tested cognitive functions improved. The 2 antidepressants proved to be suitable for the long-term treatment of depression in the elderly and to be devoid of detrimental effects on the tested cognitive functions.</s><s>Duloxetine hydrochloride, a dual reuptake inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine, was evaluated for therapeutic efficacy and safety/tolerability in the treatment of major depression. In an 8-week multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 173 patients (aged 18-65 years) with DSM-IV major depressive disorder were randomly allocated to receive placebo (N = 70), duloxetine (N = 70), or fluoxetine, 20 mg q.d. Safety was evaluated by recording the occurrence of discontinuation rates and treatment-emergent adverse events and by measurement of vital signs and laboratory analytes. In general, duloxetine was well tolerated; 76% of patients achieved the maximum dose, and insomnia and asthenia were the only adverse events reported statistically significantly (p < .05) more frequently by duloxetine-treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients. These data indicate that duloxetine is efficacious for the treatment of major depressive disorder and is well tolerated and safe.</s><s>This was a 6-week, double-blind, randomized trial of the efficacy and tolerability of venlafaxine and fluoxetine in 109 patients with major depression and melancholia. The doses were venlafaxine 75 mg/day or fluoxetine 20 mg/day from days 1-4, venlafaxine 150 mg/day or fluoxetine 40 mg/day from days 5-10, and venlafaxine 225 mg/day or fluoxetine 60 mg/day from days 11-42. A final Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) score < 7 was attained in 41% of venlafaxine-treated and 36% of fluoxetine-treated patients. Overall, 22% of patients in each group discontinued therapy, but only 5% on venlafaxine and 9% on fluoxetine discontinued for adverse events. Nausea was reported in 5.5% of venlafaxine-treated patients and 14.8% of fluoxetine-treated patients.</s><s>Previous small trials have suggested that nefazodone does not suppress rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep or increase REM latency in depressed patients, in contrast to fluoxetine. The effects of nefazodone and fluoxetine on sleep architecture and on clinician- and patient-rated sleep measures were directly compared in this 8-week, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study. Sleep measures were obtained at baseline, while patients were unmedicated, and at Weeks 2, 4, and 8 of treatment. In 43 evaluable patients (23 nefazodone, 20 fluoxetine), nefazodone and fluoxetine demonstrated similar antidepressant efficacy. In contrast, nefazodone significantly decreased percentage of awake and movement time and did not alter sleep efficiency or number of awakenings, Stage 1 or REM sleep, or REM latency compared with baseline. Both fluoxetine- and nefazodone-treated patients also showed significant improvement in some clinician- and patient-rated sleep disturbance scores, but nefazodone-treated patients improved to a significantly greater extent than fluoxetine-treated patients in most measures.</s><s>A double-blind parallel study to compare fluoxetine with doxepin in the treatment of major depressive disorders.</s><s>To compare the efficacy and tolerability of mirtazapine and fluoxetine in depressed inpatients and outpatients. Patients with a major depressive episode (DSM-III-R), a baseline score of > or=21 on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), and > or=2 on HAM-D Item 1 (depressed mood) were randomly assigned to a 6-week treatment with either mirtazapine (N=66, 15-60 mg/day) or fluoxetine (N=67, 20-40 mg/day). The efficacy analyses were performed on the intent-to-treat group using the last-observation-carried-forward method. Mean dosages at weeks 1-4 were 36.5 mg/day for mirtazapine and 19.6 mg/day for fluoxetine; the respective dosages at weeks 5-6 were 56.3 mg and 35.8 mg.

Patients who met DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder and satisfied eligibility criteria were randomly assigned to once-daily venlafaxine XR, fluoxetine, or placebo for 12 weeks. Venlafaxine XR but not fluoxetine was significantly better than placebo at week 2 on the HAM-D depressed mood item. At week 12, the HAM-D response rate was 43% on placebo, 67% on venlafaxine XR, and 62% on fluoxetine (p < .05). Once-daily venlafaxine XR is effective and well tolerated for the treatment of major depression and concomitant anxiety and provides evidence for superiority over fluoxetine.</s><s>In a 6-week, multicentre, randomised, double-blind controlled study, tianeptine (37.5 mg/day) and fluoxetine (20 mg/day) were compared for efficacy and safety in 178 patients with major depression.

The frequency of depressed illness in subjects over the age of 65 years is an important problem of health care. 237 patients were randomised, each patient had to be treated for 12 weeks and was reviewed 5 times during the trial. The main criterium, defined as the difference of the Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating scale (MADRS) score between day 0 and day 84, was significantly different in favour of the fluoxetine group (intent to treat and per protocol analysis) (p = 0.019).</s><s>This double-blind, randomised, multicentre study compared the antidepressant efficacy and safety of two doses of milnacipran (100 mg/day and 200 mg/day) and fluoxetine (20 mg/day) in 289 inpatients with endogenous depression. HDRS total score was reduced by a mean of 14.8 in the milnacipran 100 mg/day group, 12.9 in the milnacipran 200 mg/day group and 12.1 in the fluoxetine 20 mg/day group. No significant difference could be shown between the three treatment groups for either the HDRS or MADRS total scores. However, the time-by-time change showed a trend in favour of milnacipran 100 mg/day, which was found significantly superior to fluoxetine at day 28 for several converging parameters (MADRS, CGI-3).</s><s>Many claims have been made for superior compliance with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) compared with tricyclic antidepressants, but to date meta-analyses have not confirmed reduced dropouts in randomized controlled trials. The authors used a randomized study design to evaluate differential compliance with antidepressant medications in a primary care setting. Compliance was assessed by using pill count, patient questionnaires, and the Medication Event Monitoring System. In a secondary analysis using data from the Medication Event Monitoring System, both a survival analysis for length of time without a gap in medicine taking and a derived compliance index showed a significant advantage to fluoxetine. In both treatment arms patients with a superior compliance index were more likely to have improved in Hamilton depression scale scores by the last study visit.</s><s>Eighteen outpatients with major depression (diagnosis was made according to DSM-III criteria) were treated in a 5-week double-blind parallel group comparison of the new antidepressant fluoxetine with imipramine. Imipramine and fluoxetine have already been compared in other studies, but never at such a low dosage (20 mg) for fluoxetine.</s><s>As depressive disorders carry a high risk of relapse, treatment strategies include the use of a 6-month continuation period after resolution of the acute episode. Tolerability is of major importance when determining compliance and outcome during long-term therapy. A multicenter, double-blind, comparative study of sertraline and fluoxetine was carried out in outpatients fulfilling DSM-III-R criteria for major depressive disorder. Patients were randomised to receive sertraline (50-150 mg, n = 118) or fluoxetine (20-60 mg, n = 120) for 24 weeks. Assessments for depression (HAM-D, HAD, CGI-I, CGI-S), anxiety (Covi), sleep (Leeds Sleep Evaluation scale) and quality of life (SIP) were made at study entry and at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 18 and 24. Side effects were responsible for the premature treatment withdrawal of seven (6%) sertraline patients and 12 (10%) fluoxetine patients. Two-hundred and thirty-four patients were included in an ITT analysis up to last visit (116 sertraline, 118 fluoxetine). Although the magnitude of global changes in depression, anxiety, and quality of life was larger with sertraline than fluoxetine, none of the between-group differences reached statistical significance.</s><s>In a randomized, controlled, double-blind trial, 70 patients (mean age, 49.7 years) suffering from mild to moderate depression received one tablet of either St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) extract (Calmigen) or fluoxetine hydrochloride (Prozac) twice a day for 6 weeks. Significant decreases (P<.001) of 50% in the Hypericum group and 58% in the fluoxetine group in the HAMD score and of 42% and 52% on the DS spoke to the efficacy of both medications. The Hypericum extract achieved 83% of the efficacy of fluoxetine on the HAMD and 78% on the DS. Assessments by physicians (CGI) and patients indicated considerable improvement with no between-treatment differences.</s><s>However, this subtype has been the infrequent subject of controlled investigation during depression trials. Yet, the subcategorization of agitated depression has historically been associated with the belief that older, sedating compounds have a superior risk:benefit profile. In the 8-week, double-blind, randomized, parallel trial, 124 subjects with Research Diagnostic Criteria-compatible agitated depression were randomized to either imipramine (IMI) or fluoxetine (FLU). Similar comparability was seen in secondary measures of agitation, anxiety, suicidality, and global impressions. In conclusion, among subjects with major depression, subtype agitated, the risk:benefit profile favored FLU over IMI.</s><s>We report results from a multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind comparison of the efficacy and tolerability of paroxetine and fluoxetine in outpatients with major depression. Across five U.S. sites, 128 outpatients (mean age: 41.3 +/- 12.6; 63 men and 65 women) with moderate to moderately severe major depression without a history of mania or hypomania were recruited between 1993 and 1994. There were no significant differences among the three treatment groups in baseline and endpoint depression and anxiety severity, as well as in the degree of depression and anxiety improvement.</s><s>Fluoxetine 40 mg vs maprotiline 75 mg in the treatment of out-patients with depressive disorders.</s><s>Fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, was compared with mianserin and placebo in a double-blind study. Significantly more patients on fluoxetine improved than patients on placebo. Mean HDRS at the end of the study was also statistically significantly lower for fluoxetine, but not for mianserin, than placebo.</s><s>The antidepressant efficacy and side effect profile of a fixed dose of 20 mg/day of fluoxetine, a specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor, were compared to those of amitriptyline. Fifty-eight patients with DSM-III-R depression were randomly assigned to receive either fluoxetine or amitriptyline. Patients taking fluoxetine reported less side-effects than those taking amitriptyline.</s><s>Fluoxetine versus clomipramine in major depressive disorders.</s><s>We compared the efficacy and tolerability of venlafaxine XR with that of fluoxetine in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in depressed outpatients. Patients were randomly assigned to eight weeks of treatment with either venlafaxine XR 75-225 mg/day (n = 100), fluoxetine 20-60 mg/day (n = 103), or placebo (n = 98). Withdrawal from the study due to adverse events occurred in 6% of the patients in the venlafaxine XR group and 9% of the patients in the fluoxetine group. Patients treated with venlafaxine XR, but only rarely those treated with fluoxetine, had statistically significant improvements in their depression ratings compared with placebo at the end of the study. The percentages of patients who achieved full remission of their depression (HAM-D21 total score < or = 7) at the end of treatment were 37%, 22% and 18% for the venlafaxine XR, fluoxetine and placebo groups, respectively. The superior remission outcome observed with venlafaxine XR treatment needs to be replicated in additional studies.</s><s>A double-blind clinical trial was undertaken to evaluate clinical efficacy and safety of fluoxetine in comparison with the standard tricyclic antidepressant, imipramine, in the treatment of depressive illness.</s><s>The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of reboxetine, a uniquely selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine. A sub-analysis of patients with severe depression indicated that reboxetine had superior efficacy compared with fluoxetine. The results indicate that reboxetine is an effective and well tolerated antidepressant, being more effective than fluoxetine in patients with severe depression, and more effective in terms of social functioning in those patients who achieved remission.</s><s>The efficacy and tolerability of moclobemide (300-600 mg daily) and fluoxetine (20-40 mg daily) were compared in a 6-week, double-blind study of 65 inpatients and 34 outpatients suffering from major depressive episodes (DSM III-R). No statistically significant differences between the two treatment groups were noted regarding efficacy (HDRS, CGI) or safety (adverse events, laboratory examination, vital signs). Doubling the low dosage in non-responders after 3 weeks resulted in a statistically significant improvement of CGI in the moclobemide group by comparison with the fluoxetine group at study end, suggesting that 600 mg moclobemide/day can still improve the patient's condition, while 40 mg fluoxetine/day does not.</s><s>Few studies have compared the treatment efficacy of the 2 selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors sertraline and fluoxetine. A randomized, single-blind, parallel-group study of 10 weeks' duration comparing the efficacy of sertraline, 50 mg/day; sertraline, 100 mg/day; and fluoxetine, 20 mg/day, was conducted in 44 psychiatric outpatients with DSM-IV unipolar major depressive disorder. At 4 weeks, significant differences in rate of positive treatment response were noted, with 0% for sertraline, 50 mg; 46% for sertraline, 100 mg; and 31% for fluoxetine, 20 mg (p = .023). Subjects taking sertraline, 100 mg, and fluoxetine, 20 mg, demonstrated an earlier treatment response compared with subjects taking sertraline, 50 mg. For patients without a positive response at 6 weeks, an increased antidepressant dose resulted in remission for a substantial proportion of patients when assessed 4 weeks later.</s><s>The efficacy and tolerability of moclobemide (300 or 600 mg daily) and fluoxetine (20 or 40 mg daily) were compared in a 6-week, double-blind study of 25 inpatients and 24 outpatients who had major depressive episodes without psychotic features (DSM-III-R). Although the clinical results of this study suggest better efficacy with moclobemide and better tolerability with fluoxetine, a statistically significant difference between treatment groups was noted only with respect to Clinical Global Impressions recorded after 10 days of therapy; these were significantly better in the moclobemide group.</s><s>In a randomised double-blind comparative trial, the antidepressant efficacy of a daily dose of 800 mg of the St. John's wort extract LoHyp-57 (dry extract of St. John's wort, drug extrakt ratio 5-7:1, solvent, ethanol 60% [w/w]) was shown to be equivalent to that of 20 mg fluoxetine (CAS 54910-89-3) in elderly patients with mild or moderate depressive episodes according to ICD 10 (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems). 149 out-patients (129 females and 20 males) were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. During the six-week course of treatment with LoHyp-57, the HAMILTON global score fell from 16.60 points at entry to 7.91 points, and in the fluoxetine sample it fell from 17.18 to 8.11 points. In the group of patients with mild depressive episodes, the score showed a mean fall from 14.21 to 6.21 points on LoHyp-57, and from 15.21 to 7.46 points on fluoxetine. Twelve ADRs with a possible relationship to the study medication were reported during treatment with LoHyp-57. Six patients were prematurely withdrawn from treatment with the study medication for this reason. These led to abandonment of treatment and therefore premature withdrawal from the study in 8 cases.</s><s>Fluoxetine (20 mg) was compared to dothiepin (150 mg) in a multicentre, prospective, double blind, randomised clinical trial involving 125 patients with major depression treated for an initial phase of 6 weeks and then followed up for a further 6 months. The impact of both drugs on sleep measured using the Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire showed no significant differences between treatments, however drowsiness and disturbed sleep were reported more frequently as side effects with dothiepin. The short term and long term tolerability of dothiepin was inferior to that of fluoxetine.</s><s>This was an 8-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study of the efficacy and tolerability of venlafaxine and fluoxetine. Outpatients with DSM-III-R major depression, a minimum score of 20 on the 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), and depressive symptoms for at least 1 month were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with venlafaxine, 37.5 mg twice daily, or fluoxetine, 20 mg once daily. Three hundred eighty-two patients were randomly assigned to therapy and included in the intent-to-treat analysis. The most frequent adverse events were nausea, headache, and dizziness with venlafaxine and nausea, headache, and insomnia with fluoxetine.</s><s>Twenty-eight elderly inpatients suffering from major depressive episodes (diagnosed according to DSM III) received randomly, on a double-blind basis, amitriptyline (75 mg/die) or fluoxetine (20 mg/die) for five weeks. There were four drop-outs in the amitriptyline group and two drop-outs in the fluoxetine group.</s><s>A total of 27 subjects began active treatment in this double-blind study comparing the efficacy and safety of trazodone and fluoxetine in geriatric depressed patients, but only 13 completed 6 weeks on study medication.</s><s>The efficacy of moclobemide (300-450 mg/day) was compared with fluoxetine (20-40 mg/day) in a double-blind, multicentre study in 209 patients with new episodes of depression selected from 612 consecutive depressed patients representative of those consulting psychiatric services in Finland. Similarly, 77% of the patients in the moclobemide group and 67% in the fluoxetine group were assessed on the CGI as much better or very much better after 6 weeks of treatment. The most commonly reported adverse events were nausea, other gastrointestinal symptoms, nervousness, dizziness and sleep disorders. Nausea was significantly more common in the fluoxetine group and was found especially in women. Premature terminations of treatment were 18% in the moclobemide and 21% in the fluoxetine group. Improvement was not only seen in dimensions measuring depression or mental health but also in other dimensions.</s><s>Fluoxetine, a new serotonin uptake blocking antidepressant, was compared with amitriptyline in a double-blind study. Patients were diagnosed as having major depression, according to DSM-III criteria, when interviewed with the Diagnostic Interview Schedule.</s><s>This study was undertaken to compare the efficacy and safety of bupropion and fluoxetine. Weekly efficacy assessments included Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety, Clinical Global Impressions-Severity, and Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement. A total of 61 patients were randomly assigned to receive bupropion (225-450 mg/day) and 62 were randomly assigned to receive fluoxetine (20-80 mg/day). Twenty-six percent (N = 16) of the bupropion-treated and 29% (N = 18) of the fluoxetine-treated patients prematurely discontinued treatment. Both bupropion and fluoxetine demonstrated similar efficacy in relieving depression and accompanying symptoms of anxiety, and both exhibited a similar, favorable safety profile.</s><s>In previous open-label trials, nefazodone improved sleep continuity and increased rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, while not affecting stage 3/4 sleep or REM latency: in contrast, fluoxetine suppressed REM sleep. This paper reports combined results of three identical, multisite, randomized, double-blind, 8-week, acute-phase trials comparing nefazodone (n = 64) with fluoxetine (n = 61) in outpatients with nonpsychotic major depressive disorder and insomnia. Sleep electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings were gathered at baseline and weeks 2, 4, and 8. Fluoxetine, but not nefazodone, prolonged REM latency and suppressed REM sleep. These differential sleep EEG effects are consistent with the notion that nefazodone and fluoxetine may have somewhat different modes and spectra of action.</s><s>In this randomized, open-label, 8-week comparative study, the efficacy and safety of venlafaxine and fluoxetine were assessed in outpatients with major depression. One hundred forty-five patients were assigned to receive venlafaxine 37.5 mg twice daily or fluoxetine 20 mg once daily. One hundred forty-five patients were evaluated for safety and 110, for efficacy. In both treatment groups, mean scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale decreased significantly between baseline (27.8, venlafaxine; 29.2, fluoxetine) and the end of the study (8.7, venlafaxine; 8.2, fluoxetine). The results of this study indicate that venlafaxine is effective and well tolerated for the treatment of major depression at doses of 37.5 or 75 mg twice daily and not significantly different from fluoxetine 20 or 40 mg once daily.</s><s>A double-blind, multinational study was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of fluvoxamine and fluoxetine in outpatients with major depressive episode; 184 patients were randomised to fluvoxamine (100 mg/day) or fluoxetine (20 mg/day) for 6 weeks. Both drugs were effective and there were no statistically significant differences between them in the area under the curve of change from baseline in the Hamilton depression rating scale (HAMD) total score. During the last 2 weeks, fluvoxamine was significantly more effective in improving the HAMD sleep disturbance scale. Fluvoxamine and fluoxetine have similar efficacy and safety profiles in the treatment of major depressive episode; the findings of this study indicate that fluvoxamine may have a faster onset of action with respect to resolution of depressive symptoms and result in a better improvement in sleep quality.</s><s>Moclobemide and fluoxetine were tested in a six-week trial involving 122 patients with major depressive illness. The trial was completed by 49 patients receiving moclobemide, and 43 patients receiving fluoxetine. The frequencies of occurrence of adverse reactions were also similar, but sedation, nausea and vomiting were reported more frequently with fluoxetine, and insomnia was experienced with moclobemide.</s><s>Accumulating evidence suggests that noradrenergic and serotonergic drugs are equally effective in ameliorating the depressive symptoms of major depression. We set out to test whether treatment with the selective serotonergic drug Fluoxetine (Prozac) would be advantageous in this respect over treatment with the selective noradrenergic tricyclic antidepressant drug Desipramine (Deprexan). More studies in larger samples of patients are required, but it may be that in cases where memory impairment is a major symptom, it would be beneficial to consider serotonergic antidepressant drugs for treatment. Furthermore, in cases where, for various reasons, the treatment of choice is noradrenergic, it may be worthwhile to consider a supplementary serotonergic drug to improve memory deficits.</s><s>The effectiveness of fluoxetine as an antidepressant was contrasted with trazodone in a 6-week double-blind trial in 40 patients. However, that difference was no longer apparent during the remainder of the study. The authors hypothesize that fluoxetine 20 mg/day may be an ineffective dosage of the drug or that fluoxetine has a slower onset of antidepressant action than does trazodone.</s><s>Fluoxetine, a selective inhibitor of 5-HT uptake, was compared to dothiepin in a double-blind study of 6 weeks duration in 100 depressed patients (male and female) drawn from 8 general practices. However, by the end of the trial there was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups. Subset analyses of HAM-D scores associated with anxiety and sleep revealed no statistically significant differences between the 2 treatments though improvement in anxiety scores was marginally greater for those receiving fluoxetine by the end of the trial. Other global assessments by patients and doctors confirmed the changes in HAM-D scores. Whereas fluoxetine-treated patients lost weight (p less than 0.05), dothiepin-treated patients gained weight (p = 0.05) over this period. Adverse effects were reported in 27 patients given fluoxetine and 20 dothiepin.</s><s>This study assessed whether fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine differ in efficacy and tolerability in depressed patients and the impact of baseline insomnia on outcomes. Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs), reasons for discontinuation, and AEs leading to discontinuation. Depression improvement, assessed with the HAM-D-17 total score, was similar among treatments in all patients (p = 0.365) and the high (p = 0.853) and low insomnia (p = 0.415) subgroups. Analyses revealed no significant differences between treatments in the percentages of patients with substantial worsening, any worsening, worsening at endpoint, or improvement at endpoint in the HAM-D sleep disturbance factor in either insomnia subgroup. No significant differences between treatments in the incidence of AEs suggestive of activation or sedation were seen in the insomnia subgroups. These data show no significant differences in acute treatment efficacy and tolerability across fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine in major depressive disorder patients.</s><s>This was a randomized, double-blind comparison of the efficacy and safety of venlafaxine and fluoxetine in outpatients with major depression. If the response was inadequate after two weeks of treatment, the dosage of venlafaxine could be increased to 75 mg twice daily. Among patients who increased their dose at 2 weeks, venlafaxine was significantly (p < 0.05) superior from week 3 onward on the HAM-D. 6.</s><s>A double blind controlled trial was carried out in 65 depressed out-patients to compare the efficacy and tolerance of mianserin with fluoxetine. Mianserin is an antagonist of the alpha 2-adrenergic receptors, while fluoxetine is an inhibitor of recapture specific to serotonin. Assessment, using the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), the HARD diagram, the check list for somatic symptoms and side-effects was carried out before treatment and at the end of weeks 2, 4, 8. Clinical Global Impression (CGI), Therapeutic Index (TI), Tolerance Global Impression were assessed at end-point.</s><s>Fluoxetine is the first selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant to be marketed in the U.S. Significantly fewer patients in each active drug group terminated early due to lack of efficacy compared to placebo. The results support previous studies which suggest fluoxetine's superior side-effect profile and the approximate antidepressant equivalence of fluoxetine and TCAs.</s><s>A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, 6-week study was undertaken to compare the efficacy and tolerability of once or twice daily administration of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors paroxetine and fluoxetine. One hundred patients were recruited into the study, of whom 78 were evaluable for the efficacy analysis. Paroxetine and fluoxetine showed comparable efficacy at the end of the 6-week treatment period, but a statistically significant difference in the number of responders at week 3 in favour of paroxetine was observed. Patients on paroxetine reported fewer adverse events than those on fluoxetine. The most commonly reported adverse events were nausea and vomiting in both groups.</s><s>Pramipexole, a dopamine D2 receptor agonist, was tested in 174 patients with major depression, with or without melancholia and without psychotic features. Three daily dose levels (0.375 mg, 1.0 mg, and 5.0 mg) were compared to fluoxetine (Prozac) at 20 mg and placebo in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study. All patients who received one dose of study medication were included in the observed-case analysis (no missing data were replaced). Results indicated that by endpoint (week 8), patients receiving pramipexole at the 1.0 mg per day dose had significant improvement over baseline compared to the placebo group by measure of the HAM-D, MADRS, and CGI-SI. Significant improvement in this dose group was seen at other timepoints as well.</s><s>Seventy inpatients with a DSM-III-R major depression were included in a double-blind, randomized, clinical trial to compare the efficacy and tolerability of moclobemide versus fluoxetine. Efficacy was measured by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), Clinical Global Impression, and subjective mood ratings (45-item self-rating scale). Fifty-three patients (mean age, 40 years; 22 men, 31 women) completed the 4-week treatment. Changes between end of treatment and baseline did not differ between both study drugs. The earlier efficacy of moclobemide after 1 week was also detected by the patients' subjective mood ratings (p < 0.02). There were no differences between moclobemide and fluoxetine regarding tolerability ratings.</s><s>An eight-week double-blind, multicentre study was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sertraline vs. fluoxetine in the treatment of major depression (DSM-III-R). The final mean daily dose of sertraline was 72 mg and for fluoxetine it was 28 mg. The incidence of adverse events was similar for both treatments; 40.4% for sertraline and 39.3% for fluoxetine. However, adverse events were generally rated by patients as of lower severity in the sertraline group. Sertraline was considered to be better tolerated than fluoxetine overall, since only 9.6% of sertraline-treated patients discontinued treatment due to therapy failure whereas in the fluoxetine-treated group this figure was 19.6%.</s><s>Major depression with high levels of anxiety (anxious depression) is a common subtype of depression associated with greater psychosocial impairment and poorer response to antidepressant treatment. It is unclear whether in this population there are differences in efficacy or tolerability across selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. For this reason, using head-to-head acute treatment comparison, we compared efficacy and tolerability of fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine among depressed patients with high levels of anxiety. Patients (N = 108) with DSM-IV major depression and high levels of anxiety (a HAM-D-Anxiety/Somatization Factor score > or =7) were randomized to fluoxetine, sertraline, or paroxetine treatment in a double-blind fashion. Patients also demonstrated similar change-over-time improvement in HAM-D-17 and HAM-D-Anxiety/Somatization Factor scores, except at week one where fluoxetine- and sertraline-treated patients had statistically significantly greater improvement than paroxetine-treated patients in the HAM-D-Anxiety/Somatization Factor score.</s><s>In a multicentre, double blind, parallel group study 281 patients with DSM III-R diagnosis of dysthymia or a single episode of major depression in partial remission were randomised to 3 months of treatment with amisulpride 50 mg/day or fluoxetine 20 mg/day. The baseline Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score was reduced by at least 50% in 74.1% of patients (103/139) with amisulpride and 67.4% (87/129) with fluoxetine (P =0.230). There were 13 dropouts due to adverse events with amisulpride and ten with fluoxetine. The number of patients reporting at least one adverse event was similar in the two groups (amisulpride 47.5%; fluoxetine 40.9%).</s><s>Fluoxetine, a selective serotonin uptake inhibitor (mean dose 73 mg each morning) was compared with amitriptyline (mean dose 122 mg at night) in a double-blind study of 64 depressed out-patients. The drugs did not differ with respect to psychiatrists' ratings, but amitriptyline was slightly superior with respect to patients' ratings.</s><s>Using data from a larger 12-week clinical trial, the authors evaluated the comparative efficacy and safety of sertraline (n=42) and fluoxetine (n=33) in patients over age 70 with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder. Significantly greater improvement for the sertraline group was apparent on the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, but not on two other measures of cognitive functioning.</s><s>Fluoxetine in endogenous depression and melancholia versus clomipramine.</s><s>Fluoxetine was compared to doxepin in geriatric out-patients with major depressive illness. A subsequent 48-week open-label study supported the finding that both drugs are efficacious for maintenance therapy in elderly depressed patients. Fluoxetine, which lacks anticholinergic effects and is nonsedating, was well-tolerated by most patients and had fewer total side effects than doxepin. Common drug-related side effects for fluoxetine included nervousness/anxiety and nausea.</s><s>The efficacy and safety of fluoxetine, a new antidepressant agent, were assessed in a double-blind, parallel, randomized study of 44 outpatients with major depressive disorder. Following a 1-week placebo period, patients were randomly assigned to either fluoxetine or amitriptyline for a period of 5 weeks. The mean maintenance dosages were 55 mg/day for fluoxetine and 159 mg/day for amitriptyline.</s><s>The temporal dimension, particularly anticipation, appears to be a very important component in the understanding of depressed patients. The two drugs did not differ over the whole course of the study, but the improvement in scores on day 4 was globally more marked in the amineptine than the fluoxetine group. The positive effect of amineptine on anticipation may enable the depressed patient to make plans for the future.</s><s>In the present double-blind controlled study the efficacy and safety of fluoxetine 20 mg/day versus clomipramine 75 mg/day was evaluated during 5 weeks of treatment in 30 hospitalized patients. Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated weekly by using HRSD, Zung Self Rating Scale for Depression, Montgomery-Asberg Scale for Depression, Clinical Global Impression for severity and improvement of depressive symptoms.</s><s>Recent studies have suggested clinical differences among selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. A total of 203 patients were randomized to fixed doses (20 mg/day) of paroxetine or fluoxetine for the first six weeks of therapy. From week 7-12, dosing could be adjusted biweekly, as required (paroxetine 20-50 mg/day, and fluoxetine 20-80 mg/day). Emergence of motor nervousness or restlessness was assessed using the ESRS scale for akathisia. Both active treatments demonstrated comparable antidepressant efficacy (HAM-D, CGI). The overall incidence of adverse effects was comparable in the two treatment groups. Weight loss was more common in the fluoxetine versus paroxetine group (11.88% versus 2.94%, respectively). Differences observed between the two drugs in antianxiety effects were limited to two measures of anxiety among several others.</s><s>The atypical subtype of depression appears to be both well validated and common. Although monoamine oxidase inhibitors are effective in treating atypical depression, their side effects and prescription-associated dietary restrictions reduce their suitability as a first-line treatment. The objective of this study was to estimate the efficacy of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine in the treatment of major depression with atypical features. One hundred fifty-four subjects with DSM-IV major depression who met the Columbia criteria for atypical depression were randomly assigned to receive fluoxetine, imipramine, or placebo for a 10-week clinical trial. In both intention-to-treat and completer groups, the effectiveness of both fluoxetine and imipramine was significantly better than that of placebo. Before treatment, patients on average rated themselves as very impaired on psychological dimensions of general health and moderately impaired on physical dimensions, compared with population norms.</s><s>Sertraline and fluoxetine have pharmacokinetic and pharmacologic differences, which may be of clinical relevance. A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study of 6 weeks' duration comparing the efficacy and safety of sertraline (50-100 mg/day) with those of fluoxetine (20-40 mg/day) was conducted in 286 psychiatric outpatients with DSM-III-R major depression or bipolar disorder (depressed). Additionally, scores for two items and five factors from the HAM-D were analyzed. There was also no significant difference in the proportion of responders in each group. CGI-Improvement responder rates were 69% for sertraline and 67% for fluoxetine. Results of secondary efficacy measurements followed the same trend, although from the second week of treatment there was a numerical advantage (not statistically significant) for sertraline over fluoxetine in improving anxiety symptoms as measured by the total HAM-A score.</s><s>8 general practitioners and 7 specialists in the field of psychiatry and neurology participated in this study evaluating the results of fluoxetine treatment in outpatients with depression in respect to safety and efficacy. The study was designed as a randomised double-blind parallel study involving 139 patients, comparing the effects of a daily dosage of 20 mg fluoxetine, 40 mg fluoxetine and 50 mg clomipramine. The number of patients treated in each group was 45, 46, and 48, respectively and altogether 125 completed the four-week study (five visits). On day 14 of the study (visit 4), patients receiving 40 mg fluoxetine showed significantly (p less than 0.05) better global improvement than patients receiving clomipramine. Severe depression tended to be treated by psychiatrists; general practitioners prescribed additional medication less frequently.</s><s>There has been a paucity of well-designed studies comparing selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications in the treatment of depression in the elderly. Two hundred thirty-six outpatients 60 years of age and older who met DSM-III-R criteria for major depressive disorder received 1 week of single-blind placebo before being randomly assigned to 12 weeks of double-blind, parallel-group treatment with flexible daily doses of either sertraline (range, 50-100 mg) or fluoxetine (range, 20-40 mg). Secondary outcome assessments included clinician- and patient-rated measures of depression symptoms and factors, cognitive functioning, and quality of life, as well as plasma drug concentrations, which were correlated with clinical response. Sertraline-treated patients showed statistically greater cognitive improvement on several measures. Data indicate that both drugs are effective antidepressants for the treatment of depressed elderly outpatients.</s><s>Fluoxetine vs amitriptyline in the treatment of depressed out-patients.</s><s>Impairment in social and occupational functioning, increased comorbidity with other psychiatric and medical conditions, and an increased risk of mortality are a few of its consequences. The objective of this double-blind study was to compare the efficacy and safety of fluoxetine and nortriptyline in patients with moderate to severe major depression. Patients had a baseline Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score of at least 20. In this double-blind, single-center trial, patients were randomly assigned to receive nortriptyline 150 mg/day (group 1) or fluoxetine 60 mg/day (group 2) for 6-weeks. The results suggest that the efficacy of nortriptyline is superior to fluoxetine in this group of major depressed patients. No significant differences were observed between dropout rates in the two groups but anti-cholinergic side-effects were significantly more frequent with nortriptyline than with fluoxetine but there was no significant difference in cardiovascular effects in particular QTc prolongation.</s><s>Two dimensions of compliance (drop-outs and adherence) were investigated in patients treated with antidepressant drugs. Overall effectiveness [50% decrease in the initial Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D)] was similar in both groups (62.8% for fluoxetine, 58.1% for amitriptyline). The dropout rate due to side effects was 35.5% for amitriptyline and 5.7% for fluoxetine. The present study suggests that the link between efficacy, side effects and compliance or adherence is more complex than is generally believed and that early termination and non-adherence seem to be determined by different factors.</s><s>The clinical profile of reboxetine, a selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, was compared with that of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine and placebo in a double-blind, multicenter, parallel-group clinical trial of patients with major depression. Among the 381 patients treated with reboxetine 8 to 10 mg/day, fluoxetine 20 to 40 mg/day, or placebo for up to 8 weeks, a statistically significant greater reduction in the mean Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (21-item HAM-D) total score (the primary efficacy variable) was seen for both active treatment groups compared with placebo (p < 0.024). Reboxetine and fluoxetine are more effective than placebo in the treatment of major depression. Futhermore, both antidepressants are well tolerated but possess different adverse event profiles.</s><s>A double-blind parallel study comparing fluoxetine with imipramine in the treatment of atypical depression.</s><s>The antidepressant efficacy and short-term safety of venlafaxine and fluoxetine were compared in 68 patients hospitalized with major depression and melancholia.</s><s>In a six-week double-blind randomized trial, preceded by a one-week single-blind placebo treatment, the efficacy and the side-effects of fluoxetine (40-80 mg/d) (n = 30) and maprotiline (50-150 mg/d) (n = 35) were compared in hospitalized patients with DSM-III Major Depression without psychotic features. A statistically significant improvement was achieved in both treatment groups but success rates were modest.</s><s>Fluoxetine (60 mg), a selective inhibitor of the reuptake of 5-HT, was compared in a double-blind trial to amitriptyline (150 mg) in a sample of 34 patients fitting the Research Diagnostic Criteria for a major depressive disorder. Patients were studied after a drug washout period of 10 days and an active treatment period of 42 days. Sleep polygraphic recordings were performed before and at the end of the study.</s><s>The efficacy and the tolerance of milnacipran (100 mg/day), a second generation antidepressant which equipotently inhibits both noradrenaline and serotonin reuptake, was compared to fluoxetine (20 mg/day), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, in two parallel groups of, respectively, 97 and 93 major depressive outpatients. The duration of the study was 6 weeks, with assessments every 2 weeks by means of the Montgomery and Asberg depression scale (MADRS), the Hamilton depression scale, the clinical global impressions (CGI), and a checklist of symptoms and side-effects. Results showed significant superiority of fluoxetine over milnacipran on most rating instruments: MADRS (P = 0.01) including five individual items, Hamilton depression scale (P = 0.002) including ten individual items, CGI of severity (P = 0.01) and therapeutical index (P = 0.002).</s><s>The objective of the present study was to compare the safety and efficacy of moclobemide versus fluoxetine in adult patients with major depressive disorder. The design of the study was a multicenter, double-blind, comparative, and randomized trial. There were 128 patients eligible to be randomized, with 66 patients receiving moclobemide and 62 patients receiving fluoxetine. Headache and nausea were the most frequently reported adverse events in both treatment groups. These results provide supporting evidence of the comparable efficacy of moclobemide and fluoxetine and the better tolerability of moclobemide when used in the treatment of major depressive disorder.</s><s>Although common in clinical settings, major depressive disorder with associated anxious symptoms ('anxious depression') has not been well studied in antidepressant clinical trials. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of fluoxetine versus amitriptyline in this group of patients. Assessment instruments included: 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety, Clinical Global Impressions, Raskin Depression Scale and Covi Anxiety Scale. A total of 157 patients were randomized to either fluoxetine or amitriptyline. Fluoxetine was given at a fixed dose of 20 mg/day and amitriptyline was given in a range of 50-250 mg/day (mean of 138.1 mg/day). Fluoxetine was comparably efficacious to amitriptyline in the treatment of major depression with associated anxiety.</s>"

        "Abstracts": "<s>This study assessed the efficacy of oral etilefrine (10 mg three times a day) in preventing a positive response to head-up tilt testing. After the first test, patients had no treatment for 3 days and were randomized to receive etilefrine or placebo for 4 additional days. They underwent tilt testing under treatment and again after 3 days of washout; they then received the alternative treatment for 4 days, and a third test was performed. Head-up tilt test results were negative in 13 (43%) patients with etilefrine and 15 (50%) with placebo (p = NS). Despite a low statistical power, the high rate of negative response with placebo (50%) suggests that controlled trials are needed to assess the real efficacy of any treatment in patients with vasovagal syncope.</s><s>This study was undertaken to assess the value of dual chamber pacing in the treatment of vasovagal syncope. In a preliminary study, on two patients the time to presyncope during head-up tilt before and after implanting pacemakers was determined. Both patients fainted with similar decreases in blood pressure at almost exactly the same time after tilting.</s><s>To determine whether dual-chamber rate-adaptive Closed Loop Stimulation (CLS) could prevent recurrence of Vasovagal Syncope (VVS). The CLS algorithm is a form of rate-adaptive pacing, which responds to myocardial contraction dynamics, by measuring variations in right ventricular intracardiac impedance: during an incipient VVS it could increase paced heart rate and avoid bradycardia, arterial hypotension and syncope. The primary end point was recurrence of two VVSs during a minimum of 1 year of follow-up. At the end of the first year the nine patients were reprogrammed to the CLS mode and no syncope occurred after reprogramming. The 41 patients programmed to CLS had a mean follow-up of 19+/-4 months: none reported VVS, only four (10%) reported occasional presyncope and their quality of life greatly improved. Positive HUTT at the end of the first year failed to predict the clinical response to CLS pacing. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of CLS pacing in preventing cardioinhibitory VVS.</s><s>A double-blind randomized trial was designed to determine the efficacy of intravenous and oral disopyramide phosphate in preventing neurally mediated syncope induced by a head-up tilt test. Neurally mediated syncope is a frequent cause of syncope and may be induced by head-up tilt testing. Recent uncontrolled trials have suggested that disopyramide may be an effective therapy in patients with neurally mediated syncope. If presyncope or syncope was not provoked, isoproterenol infusion was started at a rate of 1 microgram/min and the rate gradually increased until a 25% increase in heart rate was achieved. The primary end point was prevention of syncope or presyncope provoked by head-up tilt testing. Head-up tilt test results were positive for syncope in 12 (75%) of 16 patients receiving intravenous placebo and in 12 (60%) of 20 patients receiving disopyramide (p = 0.55 Fisher exact test, 95% confidence interval [CI] -14% to 40%). Syncope recurred in 3 (27%) of the 11 patients receiving disopyramide and 3 (30%) of the 10 patients not treated pharmacologically (p > 0.05).</s><s>In patients with neurocardiogenic syncope, head-up tilt often evokes acute loss of consciousness accompanied by vasodilatation, increased plasma adrenaline and systemic hypotension. Eight subjects with recurrent neurocardiogenic syncope and previously documented tilt-induced syncope with elevated plasma adrenaline levels participated in the present study. Subjects underwent tilt table testing after receiving oral propranolol or placebo in a double-blind randomized crossover fashion. The occurrence of tilt-induced neurally mediated hypotension and syncope, duration of tilt tolerance, extent of the decrease in SVRI (systemic vascular resistance index) and magnitude of plasma adrenaline increases did not differ between the propranolol and placebo treatment phases. SVRI was inversely associated with fractional increase in plasma adrenaline during both phases. One subject did not faint when on propranolol; this subject's response is discussed in the context of central effects of propranolol.</s><s>To determine the benefit of midodrine, an alpha agonist, on symptom frequency and haemodynamic responses during head up tilt in patients with neurocardiogenic syncope. Cardiovascular investigation unit (a secondary and tertiary referral centre for the investigation and management of syncope). 16 outpatients (mean (SD) age 56 (18) years; five men) with frequent hypotensive symptoms (more than two syncopal episodes and fewer than 20 symptom free days per month), and reproducible syncope with glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) during head up tilt. Patients were randomised to receive either placebo or midodrine for one month. At the end of each study month patients completed a quality of life scoring scale (Short Form 36) and a global assessment of therapeutic response. Fourteen patients who were given placebo had tilt induced syncope compared with six given midodrine (p = 0.01). Midodrine is recommended for the treatment of neurocardiogenic syncope in patients with frequent symptoms.</s><s>Etilefrine is an alpha-agonist agent with a potent vasoconstrictor effect, which is potentially useful in preventing vasovagal syncope by reducing venous pooling and/or by counteracting reflex arteriolar vasodilatation. The present multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of this drug for the long-term management of patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope. In the 20 participating centers, 126 patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope (at least 3 episodes in the last 2 years) and a positive baseline head-up tilt response were randomly assigned to placebo (63 patients) or etilefrine at a dosage of 75 mg/d (63 patients) and were followed up for 1 year or until syncope recurred. There were no differences between the 2 study groups in the patients' baseline characteristics.</s><s>In this study, patients with rate hysteresis pacemakers implanted for vasovagal syncope were re-studied using serial tilt testing to determine whether, once triggered, pacing was more effective if the intervention rate was higher than the standard rate. Although 18 of the 20 reported complete abolition of syncope since pacing, only 8 patients could be objectively assessed. Repeat tilt testing was only of limited value in assessing the benefit of pacing.</s><s>The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of lipophilic beta-blockers in preventing recurrent neurocardiogenic syncope and the value of head-up tilt test (HUT) in predicting response to therapy. The value of HUT in predicting efficacy of therapy has not been investigated. During the 1-year of follow-up, 20 patients of group A and 8 of group B had no recurrence. In group A, of 20 patients without recurrences 12 had a positive and 8 a negative HUT result while of 8 patients with recurrences 5 had a positive and 3 a negative response to HUT.</s><s>The effectiveness of cardiac pacing in preventing vasovagal syncope remains controversial. However, DDI pacing with rate hysteresis has been reported to prevent the recurrence of cardioinhibitory vasovagal syncope in up to 35% of affected subjects and to reduce the overall incidence of syncopal episodes in the others. The aim of the present open trial was to test the effectiveness of this new pacing modality in patients with cardioinhibitory vasovagal syncope. The head-up tilt test performed 1 month after pacemaker implantation was positive in 3 of 12 patients (25%) with DDD pacing with rate drop response function and in 5 of 8 patients (62.5%) with DDI pacing with rate hysteresis.</s><s>Effects of intravenous etilefrine in neurocardiogenic syncope induced by head-up tilt testing.</s><s>This clinical investigation was performed to compare the effects of permanent dual-chamber cardiac pacing with pharmacological therapy in patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope. Patients from 14 centers were randomized to receive either a DDD pacemaker provided with rate-drop response function or the beta-blocker atenolol at the dosage of 100 mg once a day. The primary outcome was the first recurrence of syncope after randomization. The interim analysis showed a significant effect in favor of permanent cardiac pacing (recurrence of syncope in 2 patients [4.3%] after a median of 390 days) compared with medical treatment (recurrence of syncope in 12 patients [25.5%] after a median of 135 days; OR, 0.133; 95% CI, 0.028 to 0.632; P=0.004).</s><s>Intravenous metoprolol was found to be significantly more effective than placebo in preventing head-up tilt-table induced neurally mediated syncope.</s><s>Beta-blockers has been claimed to be useful in chronic prophylaxis of neurally mediated syncope with frequent recurrences. However, efficacy of cardioselective and non-cardioselective beta-blockers has never been compared in a randomized study. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either propranolol (Group I, n = 31) or metoprolol (Group II, n = 31). After one month, efficacy of treatment was also tested by a repeat head-up tilt test (HUTT). During the 16-months follow-up, 53 patients (85.5%) remained free of syncope. In both groups, the patients in whom treatment efficacy was proved by a negative tilt test had similar recurrence of syncope as those patients who had a positive tilt test (Both P>0.05). In both groups, HUTT performed one month after the treatment had no role in prediction of responders.</s><s>Three previous small randomized trials have reported that pacemaker therapy is beneficial for patients with severe recurrent vasovagal syncope. To determine if pacing therapy reduces the risk of syncope in patients with vasovagal syncope. A randomized double-blind trial of pacemaker therapy in outpatients referred to syncope specialists at 15 centers from September 1998 to April 2002. After implantation of a dual chamber pacemaker, 100 patients were randomly assigned to receive dual-chamber pacing (DDD) with rate drop response or to have only sensing without pacing (ODO). The cumulative risk of syncope at 6 months was 40% (95% confidence interval [CI], 25%-52%) for the ODO group and 31% (95% CI, 17%-43%) for the DDD group. Because of the weak evidence of efficacy of pacemaker therapy and the risk of complications, pacemaker therapy should not be recommended as first-line therapy for patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope.</s><s>The aim of this study was to evaluate the importance of atrial synchronism for pacing therapy of patients with mixed carotid sinus syndrome. Next, all patients received a permanent DDD pacemaker and entered a 2 month two period single-blind, randomized, cross-over study on DVI/DDD versus VVI mode. Group A patients had a greater pacemaker effect (-34 +/- 16 mmHg vs -16 +/- 14 mmHg) and a higher prevalence of symptomatic pacemaker effect (50% vs 0%), of ventriculo-atrial conduction (78% vs 44%) and of orthostatic hypotension (50% vs 11%), while the entity of the systolic pressure fall caused by carotid sinus massage was similar in the two groups either during VVI mode (Group A -51 +/- 16 mmHg vs Group B -56 +/- 27 mmHg) or DVI mode (Group A -38 +/- 17 mmHg vs Group B -45 +/- 17 mmHg).</s><s>To evaluate the efficacy of treatment of the vasodepressor form of carotid sinus hypersensitivity (carotid sinus syndrome (CSS)) with midodrine. A prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial of crossover design. Ten older adults (4 male, 6 female, mean age 75, range 66-86 years) with a history of unexplained syncope who displayed an asymptomatic decrease in systolic BP (SBP) of more than 50 mmHg or a symptomatic decrease of more than 30 mmHg within 30 seconds of carotid sinus massage (CSM). Ambulatory 24-hour BP monitoring took place on the penultimate and final days of each treatment phase. The mean+/-standard deviation SBP decrease after initial CSM was 54+/-22 mmHg. One patient reported symptoms after CSM at the end of the active-treatment phase. The mean SBP decrease at the end of the active-treatment phase was 36+/-9 mmHg.</s><s>This study was done to evaluate pacemaker therapy for severe recurrent vasovagal syncope. Nonrandomized studies have suggested that permanent pacing might help control the symptoms of recurrent vasovagal syncope. Patients with > or = 6 lifetime episodes of syncope and with a tilt-table test that induced syncope or presyncope, as well as a relative bradycardia, were randomized to receive a dual-chamber pacemaker or not. A total of 284 patients was originally planned and a pilot study of 60 patients was initiated. At that time, there were 54 patients enrolled, randomized evenly to no pacemaker or to pacemaker. In the no-pacemaker and pacemaker groups the mean ages were 40 and 46 years; 74% and 70% patients, respectively, were female.</s><s>To determine whether single chamber ventricular demand (VVI) pacing is adequate for elderly patients with carotid sinus syndrome. 30 consecutive patients aged over 60 years with carotid sinus syndrome referred for cardiac pacing. 11 patients developed profound hypotension during upright carotid sinus massage while pacing VVI compared with only two while pacing DDI. The upright pacemaker effect was greater in VVI (VVI, -31 (SD 19) mm Hg v DDI, -4 (12) mm Hg; P < 0.001). Postural blood pressure measurements and responses to head up tilt did not vary. Eleven patients were unable to tolerate VVI pacing and had to be withdrawn early from this limb of the study (group A). Fourteen of the remainder completed diary cards and did not express a preference (group B).</s><s>BACKGROUND-This study was performed to compare implantation of a DDI pacemaker with rate hysteresis with no implant in respect to syncopal recurrences in patients with severe cardioinhibitory tilt-positive neurally mediated syncope. METHODS AND RESULTS-Forty-two patients from 18 European centers were randomized to receive a DDI pacemaker programmed to 80 bpm with hysteresis of 45 bpm (19 patients) or no pacemaker (23 patients). One patient (5%) in the pacemaker arm experienced recurrence of syncope compared with 14 patients (61%) in the no-pacemaker arm (P=0.0006). On repeated tilt testing performed within 15 days after enrollment, positive responses were observed in 59% of patients with pacemakers and in 61% of patients without pacemakers (P=NS). CONCLUSIONS-In a limited, select group of patients with tilt-positive cardioinhibitory syncope, DDI pacing with hysteresis reduced the likelihood of syncope. A negative result of tilt testing was not a useful means to evaluate therapy efficacy.</s><s>Head-up tilt test was introduced in clinical practice to assess vasovagal syncope and its use has further been extended to evaluate the efficacy of drug administration in these patients. Tilt test was repeated after 1 month, while clinical outcome was evaluated monthly for a mean follow-up of 37.1 +/- 15.6 months. No significant differences in acute tilt-induced syncope recurrence rates were obtained among groups at test repetition since 70.2% of Group A, 69.6% of Group B and 62.5% of Group C experienced syncope. Irrespective of the therapeutical choice, the \"controlled reproduction\" of symptoms and some psychophysical training of patients to avoid precipitating circumstances, to recognize early symptoms promptly to be reverted by Trendelemburg position, may produce the same clinical improvement as (empiric) ethylephrine or propranolol therapy.</s><s>The purpose of the study was to determine whether the well tolerated serotonin reuptake inhibitor paroxetine hydrochloride could prevent vasovagal syncope in patients resistant to or intolerant of previous traditional therapies. Patients randomly received either paroxetine at 20 mg once a day or a placebo. A head-up tilt test was then reperformed after one month of treatment, and the clinical effect was noted over a mean follow-up of 25.4+/-7.9 months. During follow-up spontaneous syncope was reported in six patients (17.6%) in the paroxetine group as compared to 18 patients (52.9%) in the placebo group (p < 0.0001).</s><s>A dramatic increase in catecholamine (CA) concentration is believed to be a primary trigger of the neurally mediated syncope (NMS) in elderly subjects. The hypercontractile state of the heart might be alleviated by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor through depression of CA release from the sympathetic nerve ending. In this study, 24 elderly subjects who had reproducible NMS induced with head-up tilt test (HUT) were randomized and double-blind divided into placebo and ACE-inhibitor groups. From this study, we conclude that enalapril can prevent NMS in patients, presumably because of its part in the inhibition of CA release from sympathetic nerve endings.</s><s>To study the efficacy of medical treatment for preventing syncopal recurrences in patients affected by tilt-induced neurally mediated syncope, a randomized placebo-treatment prospective study was performed in 30 patients (10 men and 20 women, mean age 42 +/- 21 years) who had syncope reproduced in 2 consecutive head-up tilt-table tests without pharmacologic intervention (n = 20) or during isoproterenol infusion (n = 10). Patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups: 15 to placebo, and 15 to drug therapy (determined on the basis of serial pharmacologic tilting tests).</s><s>The natural history of patients with severe carotid sinus syndrome, and the efficacy of permanent pacemaker treatment are not clearly known. They were randomly assigned to 2 groups: 28 patients to no therapy (nonpacing group), and 32 to VVI (n = 18) or DDD (n = 14) pacemaker implant (pacing group). The actuarial rate of absence of syncopal recurrence after 1, 2, 3 and 4 years was 64, 54, 38 and 38%, respectively, for the nonpacing group, and 100, 97, 93 and 84%, respectively, for the pacing group (p = 0.0001). Reproducibility of carotid sinus reflex was tested after 15 +/- 8 months in 54 patients; an abnormal response to carotid sinus massage persisted in all 54.</s><s>A previous observational study suggested that, in syncopal elderly patients with vasovagal syndrome, a test using adenosine-5'-triphosphate (intravenous ATP 20 mg. 2 ml-1) could identify a subgroup of patients at high risk of severe cardioinhibitory response and guide the therapeutic strategy. To test one aspect of these results prospectively, we designed a small study focusing only on vasovagal patients with abnormal response to ATP testing. All patients who were not hospitalized for recurrences were assessed every 6 months in the clinic or by telephone. This limited trial (1) supports the conclusion that patients with an abnormal ATP test who receive a dual-chamber pacemaker suffer fewer recurrences than those who are monitored only; and (2) consequently further supports the hypothesis that, among vasovagal patients, a cardiac pause of longer than 10 s in patients administered ATP identifies those at high risk of symptomatic vagal cardiac inhibition.</s><s>To compare the therapeutic efficacy of placebo, propranolol, and fluoxetine in patients with vasovagal syncope (VVS). No difference was also observed when syncopes and presyncopes were assessed separately. Among the remaining 76 ('on-treatment' analysis), the mean time to a vasovagal episode (syncope or presyncope) was significantly longer in the fluoxetine group when compared with the two other groups (log-rank test, P < 0.05). A significant difference in favour of fluoxetine was also observed regarding presyncopes. The difference between groups regarding the syncope-free period was not significant.</s><s>The efficacy of midodrine for the management of patients with neurocardiogenic syncope was assessed prospectively in a randomized control study. Midodrine was given at a starting dose of 5 mg three times a day and increased up to a dose of 15 mg three times a day when required. Thirty-one patients were assigned to treatment with midodrine; the other 30 patients were advised to increase their fluid intake and were instructed to recognize their prodromes and abort the progression to syncope. At the 6-month follow-up, 25 (81%) of 31 midodrine-treated patients and 4 (13%) of the 30 fluid-therapy patients had remained asymptomatic (P < 0.001). Midodrine appeared to provide a significant benefit in patients with neurocardiogenic syncope. To prevent recurrence of symptoms, dose adjustments were required in about one third of patients.</s><s>To evaluate the efficacy of head up tilt guided treatment with metoprolol and clonidine in preventing the recurrence of syncope in patients with malignant vasovagal syncope. 20 patients (9 men and 11 women, mean age 33 (SD 17), range 14 to 62 years) with severe symptoms. Randomised double blind crossover trial; efficacy was assessed by head up tilt testing. During an average follow up of 15 (3) months there was a significant reduction in the recurrence of symptoms compared with the previous year in patients who had tilt up guided treatment (18 metoprolol, 1 clonidine).</s><s>The aim of the study was to determine whether cardiac pacing reduces falls in older adults with cardioinhibitory carotid sinus hypersensitivity (CSH). Cardioinhibitory carotid sinus syndrome causes syncope, and symptoms respond to cardiac pacing. A randomized controlled trial was done of consecutive older patients (>50 years) attending an accident and emergency facility because of a non-accidental fall. One hundred seventy-five eligible patients (mean age 73 +/- 10 years; 60% women) were randomized to the trial: pacemaker 87; controls 88. Falls (without loss of consciousness) were reduced by two-thirds: controls reported 669 falls (mean 9.3; range 0 to 89), and paced patients 216 falls (mean 4.1; range 0 to 29). There is a strong association between non-accidental falls and cardioinhibitory CSH.</s><s>Efficacy of a patient-activated pharmacologic pump using phenylephrine as active drug and prodromal symptoms as a marker of imminent loss of consciousness to abort tilt-induced syncope.</s><s>Recently, some studies revealed the efficacy of pacemaker implantation in decreasing recurrences in patients with vasovagal syncope. We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in order to ascertain if pacing therapy reduces the risk of syncope relapse. Twenty-nine patients (53 +/- 16 years; 19 women) with severe recurrent tilt-induced vasovagal syncope (median 12 syncopes in the lifetime) and 1 syncopal relapse after head-up tilt testing underwent implantation of a pacemaker, and were randomized to pacemaker ON or to pacemaker OFF. There was also no significant difference in the subgroups of patients who had had a mixed response and in those who had had an asystolic response during head-up tilt testing.</s><s>Neurally mediated syncope is the most frequent cause of syncope in patients without structural heart disease. Its most common trigger is a reduction in venous return to the heart due to excessive venous pooling in the legs. One hour after drug or placebo administration, patients underwent 60-degree head-up tilt lasting 40 minutes (unless hypotension or bradycardia developed first). The responses to head-up tilt were significantly different on the midodrine and the placebo day: on the placebo day, 67% (8/12) of the subjects suffered neurally mediated syncope, whereas only 17% (2/12) of the subjects developed neurally mediated syncope on the midodrine day (p < 0.02).</s><s>We sought to assess the relative therapeutic efficacy of propranolol, nadolol and placebo in recurrent vasovagal syncope (VVS). It has not yet been clarified whether one of the aforementioned treatments is more efficient than the others in reducing clinical episodes and exerting a beneficial effect on patients' well-being. On the day of drug crossover, patients reported the total number of syncopal and presyncopal attacks during the previous period. They also gave a general assessment of their quality of life, taking into account: 1) symptom recurrence; 2) drug side effects; and 3) their personal well-being during therapy (scale 0 to 4: 0 = very bad/discontinuation; 1 = bad; 2 = good; 3 = very good; 4 = excellent). All drugs improved the patients' well-being (ANOVA: chi-square = 61.9, p < 0.0001).</s><s>Recent clinical trials have shown that selected patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope (VVS) may benefit from permanent cardiac pacing. Twenty-three patients (age 61.8 +/- 15.2 years, 19 men) with recurrent VVS were enrolled at seven European centers and underwent implantation of a \"MiniLivingD/Best\" pacing system. Using a crossover study design, the pacemakers were randomly programmed for two successive periods of 6 months to DDDR or DDI mode. The numbers of episodes of syncope and presyncope, and quality-of-life (QOL), were assessed at the end of each period. QOL scores were 77.40 +/- 11.32 in the DDDR mode versus 74.45 +/- 14.59 in the DDI mode (NS). In patients with recurrent VVS, symptomatic recurrences were less frequent during contractility-driven DDDR pacing, than during DDI pacing.</s><s>The aim of this study was to examine the effect on symptoms in patients with induced cardioinhibitory carotid sinus syndrome (ICSS) when treated or not treated with a pacemaker. Sixty patients with a history of syncope or pre-syncope and ICSS were randomized to receive a permanent pacemaker (P group, n = 30) or no pacing (NP group, n = 30). Pre-syncope occurred in two patients (7%) in the NP group and in eight (27%) in the P group. Ten patients (33%) with recurrent syncope in the NP group later crossed-over to receive pacemaker implant. A history of syncope or pre-syncope, plus ICSS, was a strong predictor of subsequent syncope or pre-syncope.</s><s>We studied short-term effectiveness of transdermal scopolamine in a group of patients with unexplained syncope provoked during head-up tilt testing.</s><s>The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of long-term pharmacological therapy selected on the basis of a head-up tilt test (HUT) in patients in whom reproducibility of the HUT response was demonstrable in the initial study. Vasovagal syncope was induced in 24 patients during HUT alone, and in 30 patients during the HUT with isoproterenol. In the tilt-positive patients, HUT was repeated after an intravenous administration of propranolol (0.1 mg/kg) or disopyramide (1 mg/kg) (acute test). Thereafter, evaluation was done on the long-term clinical follow-up of the pharmacological intervention selected on the basis of the acute test in the 34 patients in whom the HUT could not induce vasovagal syncope after the oral administration of the pharmacological agent (propranolol 60 mg/day, disopyramide 300 mg/day). Thirty-two of 34 patients (94%) did not develop syncopal attacks during a 44 +/- 12-month period.</s><s>This single-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study was designed and undertaken to assess the efficacy of intravenous atropine administration on haemodynamic impairment induced by head-up tilt testing in patients with vasovagal syncope. Within 2 weeks of the first head-up tilt test all patients underwent a second tilt test. In 29 of 113 patients the second tilt test was negative and these patients were excluded from final data analysis. Forty-one patients received placebo, which was effective in nine cases (21.9%). Atropine was administered to 43 patients and was effective in 30 cases (69.7%, P<0.01 vs placebo). In the cardio-inhibitory form, placebo was never effective (15 cases), while atropine was effective in 15 of 18 cases (83.3%, P<0.001 vs placebo).</s><s>The objective of this investigation was the assessment of the response rate of oral atenolol in patients with vasovagal syncope after 1 month of treatment. After a 1-month period patients were reassessed for degree of their symptoms and underwent repeated TTT. Eight patients in Gr 1 and six patients in Gr 2 had mitral valve prolapse (p = 0.5). The response rates (negative TTT) after 1 month of treatment were 62% versus 5% (p = 0.0004) in the atenolol and control group, respectively. Moreover, patients who received atenolol reported feeling better compared with those who received placebo (71% vs 29%, p = 0.02).</s><s>This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of atenolol for the long-term management of patients with vasovagal syncope. Fifty patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope were included (at least two episodes in the last year). The Kaplan-Meier actuarial estimates of time to first syncopal recurrence showed that the probability of remaining free of syncope drops similarly in both groups and that there was no statistical difference between both curves (patients treated with atenolol vs. the placebo) with a log-rank test p value of 0.4517. The recurrence of neurocardiogenic syncope in highly symptomatic patients treated with atenolol is similar to that of patients treated with placebo.</s><s>Previous studies that assessed the effects of beta-blockers in preventing vasovagal syncope provided mixed results. Our goal was to determine whether treatment with metoprolol reduces the risk of syncope in patients with vasovagal syncope. A total of 208 patients (mean age 42+/-18 years) with a median of 9 syncopal spells over a median of 11 years were randomized, 108 to receive metoprolol and 100 to the placebo group. The likelihood of recurrent syncope was not significantly different between groups.</s><s>Head-up tilt testing is a reliable diagnostic tool for patients with recurrent unexplained syncope. It has also been used to assess the drug efficacy for the treatment of patients with syncope. Twenty-eight patients with a positive head-up tilt test were randomized to receive either metoprolol or verapamil; the test was repeated after 7 days of therapy. Of the 13 patients who initially received verapamil, 8 (61%) did not respond; after crossing over to metoprolol therapy, 1 remained unresponsive.</s>"

Of the 22 pairs of term infants enrolled in Study I, SnMP proved superior to PT in 20 and equal in two.</s><s>To assess the efficacy of Sn-mesoporphyrin (SnMP), a potent inhibitor of bilirubin production, in: a) moderating the need for phototherapy (PT) in full-term breastfed infants with plasma bilirubin concentrations (PBC) of >/=256.5 micromol/L and </=307.8 micromol/L (>/=15 mg/dL and </=18 mg/dL, respectively) that were reached between >/=48 and </=96 hours of age; b) diminishing the time required for the PBC to decline to </=222.3 micromol/L (</=13 mg/dL) (closure of the case); c) decreasing the number of bilirubin determinations required for monitoring hyperbilirubinemia. The infants' PBCs were followed by daily measurements either in the hospital or at discharge as outpatients until the hyperbilirubinemia had subsided (PBC </=222.3 micromol/L [13mg/dL]). The total number of newborns enrolled in the study was 84; the SnMP group comprised 40 infants; the control group comprised 44 infants. The groups were similar in sex ratio, birth weight, gestational age, PBC, and age at enrollment. SnMP entirely eliminated the need for supplemental PT to control hyperbilirubinemia; in contrast, of the 44 control infants, 12 required treatment with PT (27%) when their PBC reached or exceeded the level (333.5 micromol/dL; 19.5 mg/dL) at which time the use of PT was dictated by hospital guidelines. A single dose of SnMP proved effective in controlling severe hyperbilirubinemia in full-term breastfed newborns with high bilirubin levels between 48 and 96 hours.</s>"

Findings for 47 infants who were transferred from an incubator to an open crib at >1600 g (early transition group) were compared with those for 47 infants who were transferred from an incubator to an open crib at >1800 g (standard transition [ST] group). The length of stay was significantly shorter in the early transition group than in the standard transition group (23.5 vs 33 days; P=.0002). Growth velocities and individual amounts of breastfeeding were similar between the 2 groups. In this study, weaning of moderately preterm infants from incubators to open cribs at 1600 g was safe and resulted in earlier discharge.</s><s>Thirty pairs of healthy, growing preterm infants were included in this randomized prospective study comparing thermal weaning at 1700 g with that at 1800 g. Based on an intention-to-treat analysis, infants weaned at 1700 g were discharged 1.1 days sooner than those weaned at 1800 g. However, this result was not statistically significant (p = 0.13). On the other hand, differences are apparent between treatments in some strata based on birth weight (p = 0.0056). No infant in either group lost weight after successful weaning, and mean 24-hour weight gains were similar for both groups.</s><s>Fourteen growing, healthy premature infants were moved from heated incubators to cribs at different points in their growth. The effect on their growth and thermal stability was measured during the week before and after the temperature change. A cooler environment in a growing premature infant (weight greater than 1,600 gm) may promote faster deposition of subcutaneous fat.</s>"

        "Abstracts": "<s>The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of some noninvasive pain reduction interventions on pain in 121 neonates undergoing unanesthetized circumcision. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of six groups: classical music, intrauterine sounds, pacifier, music and pacifier, intrauterine sounds and pacifier, or control (no nurses present and no pain reduction interventions used). Over the 14 steps, 42% of the heart rates, 78% of the systolic blood pressures (SBP), 30% of the diastolic blood pressures (DBP), and 81% of the tcpO2 pressures were abnormal.</s><s>To assess the effectiveness of oral sucrose via a nipple compared with no treatment and dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) for alleviating pain in neonatal circumcision. One hundred nineteen full-term male, normal birth weight neonates, 12 hours old or older. No treatment (our standard care), DPNB, or oral sucrose prior to circumcision. Overall, the average difference in the elevation of heart rates during the circumcision operative procedure among the 3 groups and the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were as follows: control vs DPNB, 27.1 beats/min (17.6, 36.6) and control vs sucrose, 9.7 beats/min (0.1, 19.3). The total percentages of lost data due to excessive motion in the 3 groups were 31% for control, 10% for DPNB, and 8% for sucrose. However, the analysis did not include missing data due to excessive motion, which occurred predominantly in the no-treatment control group. Sucrose on a pacifier is an inexpensive and effective method for pain relief in neonatal circumcision when DPNB is not desirable.</s><s>A prospective, controlled, double-blinded investigation was conducted to evaluate whether infants undergoing circumcisions with 1% lidocaine dorsal penile nerve blocks experienced decreased stress as compared with those receiving saline solution injections or no injections. A subjective grading scale was also developed to measure infant irritability. The results of the study revealed an average increase of 28.8% in the pulse rate above baseline for the control infants (p less than 0.001) versus no significant change in the lidocaine group. The nursing evaluation during the procedure gave an average rating of 4.2 to the control group versus 2.3 to the anesthetized group (p less than 0.001). The subjective evaluation of infants before and after the procedure was not significantly different.</s><s>To compare responses to circumcision between a group of unanesthetized newborn males and a group having dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB). Thirty newborn males who met the selection criteria were randomly assigned to the treatment (n = 20) or control group (n = 10). Oxygen perfusion, blood pressure, respiratory rate, heart rate, and cardiac rhythm were measured before, during, and after circumcision. In addition, observations were recorded during the procedure on crying duration and type, vomiting, gagging, breath holding, and jitteriness.</s><s>To test the effectiveness of acetaminophen for pain management during and after circumcision. Administration of 10 mg/kg acetaminophen or placebo 1 hour before circumcision. Behaviors (clarity of cues and responsiveness) were observed in newborns during a feeding interaction, and pain distress (percentage of time crying and heart rate) was assessed during and after the circumcision. At the diaper change after the circumcision, the percentage of cry did suggest an effect from the analgesia.</s><s>To compare the efficacy of the dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) with a less invasive form of local anesthesia, eutectic mixture of local anesthetic (EMLA) cream, for reduction of pain during neonatal circumcision. Tertiary referral, neonatal intensive care nursery in a university teaching hospital. Fifty infants >/=341/2 weeks postmenstrual age and stable for discharge at time of circumcision; gestational age at birth 25 to 41 weeks; birth weight 600 to 4390 g; age at study 3 to 105 days. An additional cohort of term newborns (n = 20), who were not randomized, were circumcised without anesthesia. NIPS scores in patients circumcised without anesthesia indicated severe pain. DPNB provides better pain reduction during neonatal circumcision than EMLA cream.</s><s>To determine the efficacy of topical anesthetic cream, eutectic mixture of local anesthetics (EMLA), in alleviating pain from neonatal circumcision. Compared with placebo, EMLA significantly attenuated the pain response as shown by lower heart rate of an average of 25 beats per minute (F [1, 25] = 14.92; P < .001), higher oxygen saturation of 5%, particularly during the clamping and lysis phases (F [1, 25] = 19.83; P < .0001), 20% less facial activity (F [1, 25] = 12.01; P < .002), and 15% less crying during the clamping, Gomco clamp application, and incision of the foreskin. Thus, EMLA may be a useful agent for pain management in neonatal circumcision.</s><s>Beliefs about the safety and effectiveness of current anesthetics have resulted in many newborns being circumcised without the benefit of anesthesia. A consecutive sample of 52 healthy, full-term, male newborns, aged 1 to 3 days. Newborns in the untreated placebo group exhibited homogeneous responses that consisted of sustained elevation of heart rate and high-pitched cry throughout the circumcision and following. Two newborns in the placebo group became ill following circumcision (choking and apnea). The 3 treatment groups all had significantly less crying and lower heart rates during and following circumcision compared with the untreated group. The most effective anesthetic is the ring block; EMLA is the least effective.</s><s>The purpose of this study was to identify the least painful circumcision method. The infants were circumcised with either the Mogen or the Gomco procedure and were given a sweetened pacifier or a pacifier dipped in water. All infants had a eutectic mixture of local anesthetic cream applied before circumcision. Infants who were circumcised with the Mogen procedure cried and grimaced far less than infants who were circumcised with the Gomco procedure (P =.0001).</s><s>Several studies document the benefit of dorsal penile nerve block for neonatal circumcision, but the literature does not address the use of local anesthesia. A randomized, controlled, prospective study was conducted to compare the efficacy of dorsal penile nerve block versus local anesthesia. Heart rate, transcutaneous oxygen saturation, and crying were monitored continuously before, during, and after circumcision. During circumcision, both the dorsal penile nerve block group and the local-anesthesia group demonstrated smaller increases in heart rate, smaller drops in oxygen saturation, and less crying compared with unanesthetized controls (P less than .05). Although both types of anesthesia attenuated the physiologic responses to circumcision, local anesthesia demonstrated greater efficacy than dorsal penile nerve block while being simpler to perform.</s><s>To determine the effect of two comfort interventions during unanesthesized circumcision on neonatal pain. Fifty-eight neonates were randomly assigned to one of three intervention groups. Eighteen control infants received routine care, 15 infants had music played, and 15 infants had a tape of intrauterine sounds played. During circumcision, monitors measured cardiac rate, rhythm, blood pressure, and transcutaneous oxygen. The two interventions were unable to offset the effects of circumcision pain.</s><s>To determine whether a difference in the behavioral and physiologic response to circumcision can be demonstrated between neonates undergoing the procedure with ring block and those receiving no anesthesia. Indices of perceived pain including crying time, behavioral state, oxygen saturation, and heart and respiratory rates were recorded at baseline and at intervals during the circumcision. Two minutes postoperatively, anesthetized infants had returned to their baseline behavioral state, whereas controls remained significantly more aroused (P < .005). Two hours postoperatively, there were no significant differences in any variables between the groups, nor between each group and its baseline. Neonatal circumcision causes behavioral and physiologic changes consistent with the perception of pain.</s><s>Our objectives were to determine if a 50% dextrose solution would reduce the percentage of circumcision procedure time a neonate spent crying by 50% compared with water and whether it would be similar to a dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB). Secondary outcomes were the percentage change in heart rate from baseline, the percentage of oxygen saturation, and the score from the modified behavioral pain scale. Concentrated glucose administered orally does not provide significant analgesia in neonatal circumcision. The use of DPNB significantly reduced objective measurements of pain and physiologic stress in infants undergoing circumcision.</s><s>To evaluate epicutaneous application of 5% lidocaine-prilocaine and 30% lidocaine cream anesthetics for neonatal circumcision. The efficacy of 5% lidocaine-prilocaine and 30% lidocaine creams was compared in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Sixty-one neonates were randomly assigned to one of three groups: 5% prilocaine-lidocaine (n = 20), 30% lidocaine (n = 20), and a control group that received an acid-mantle cream (n = 21). Mean peak heart rates for the 5% lidocaine-prilocaine, 30% lidocaine, and control groups (+/- standard deviation) were 146 +/- 16, 157 +/- 10, and 164 +/- 16 beats per minute, respectively. During four of six active phases of circumcision, the 5% lidocaine-prilocaine group suppressed significant increases in heart rate better than 30% lidocaine, which was more effective than control (dorsal clamp, P < .001; bell clamp on, P = .001; tightening, P = .001; bell clamp off, P < .001). Epicutaneous 5% lidocaine-prilocaine was more effective than 30% lidocaine for neonatal circumcision, better reducing neonatal stress indicators. Lidocaine-prilocaine significantly shortened crying time during one of the most painful phases of circumcision.</s><s>Circumcision in neonates is performed, almost universally, without anesthesia or analgesia. Peak plasma concentrations of the local anesthetic lidocaine averaged 0.51 +/- 0.17 microgram/mL (range 0.1-1.6), well below accepted toxic levels.</s><s>To determine if buffered lidocaine provided a more effective nerve block in a short time than plain lidocaine for neonatal circumcision. The infants were evaluated at timed intervals before the procedure, during anesthetic injection, and during circumcision. Using heart rate as the major outcome variable, it was determined that 65 subjects per group would be needed to achieve a power of .08. The behavioral characteristics and amount of crying also were comparable in both groups.</s><s>A controlled, double-blind investigation was conducted to determine whether the dorsal penile nerve block using lidocaine hydrochloride without epinephrine would effectively reduce behavioral distress and adrenocortical responses to routine neonatal circumcision. The subjects were healthy male newborns whose parents had requested circumcision. Equal numbers (n = 20) were randomly assigned to circumcision with lidocaine, saline, or no injection.</s><s>The behavior of full-term neonates undergoing circumcision with and without local anesthesia was examined using the Brazelton Neonatal Assessment Scale (BNAS). Infants receiving lidocaine in a dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) remained more attentive to animate and inanimate stimuli following circumcision and demonstrated a greater ability to quiet themselves when disturbed. Behavioral differences were still evident on the day following the procedure. These disruptions can be lessened by the use of local anesthesia to relieve pain and stress during the procedure without any additional morbidity. These data support the use of DPNB during anesthesia for routine neonatal circumcisions still requested by the majority of parents in the country.</s><s>A controlled, double-blind investigation was undertaken to determine whether regional anesthesia by dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) could effectively minimize the pain and behavioral disruptions usually associated with newborn circumcision. The mean increase in heart rate during circumcision was at least 50 percent less in the lidocaine injected group than in either control group (p less than 0.01). Infants who had DPNB with lidocaine cried 50 percent less during circumcision compared to combined controls (p less than 0.01). Physicians who circumcise newborns have good reason to employ the technique of dorsal penile nerve block with lidocaine to minimize infant pain and distress.</s><s>Eleven male newborns were circumcised with a local dorsal penile nerve block, and 13 controls were circumcised without anesthetic. Matched pairs of pre- and postcircumcision cortisol levels in the two groups were compared.</s><s>Circumcision is a common neonatal surgical procedure routinely performed without the use of anesthesia. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of topical lidocaine cream as an anesthetic for circumcision. Thirty newborns were studied in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study; 15 received a topical 30% lidocaine cream and 15 received the cream base alone. When stress-related behaviors in the precircumcision and post-circumcision periods were compared, the mean increase in their occurrence was greater in the placebo than in the treatment group.</s><s>To evaluate the effectiveness of the dorsal penile nerve block in reducing the stress of circumcision upon newborns, physiologic measurements in 30 healthy full-term infants (including transcutaneous oxygen levels, crying time, heart rate, and respiratory rate) were monitored continuously before, during, and after the operation. No complications resulted from injection of the local anesthetic or from the circumcision procedure itself. Inasmuch as dorsal penile nerve block has a low complication rate, is simple to learn, and adds little time or expense to the overall procedure, and if it proves to be as effective clinically as the physiologic data indicate, the dorsal penile nerve block should be considered for every infant undergoing circumcision.</s><s>Dorsal penile nerve blocking (DPNB) has been used with success in decreasing neonatal stress during circumcision. We found that, as in previous investigations, DPNB with lidocaine was effective in reducing neonatal stress, as was evident from decreased excursion from baseline heart rate, tissue oxygenation, and cry duration when compared with the control group (nonblocked). Furthermore, chloroprocaine DPNB approximates the effectiveness of lidocaine, as was evident from decreased change from baseline cry duration, tissue oxygenation, and heart rate during the most stressful events, particularly in the 3-minute wait chloroprocaine group.</s><s>Neonatal circumcision is a painful surgical procedure often performed without analgesia. We assessed the efficacy and safety of 5 percent lidocaine-prilocaine cream (Emla) in neonates undergoing circumcision. We carried out a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial in 68 full-term male neonates: 38 were assigned to receive lidocaine-prilocaine cream, and 30 to receive placebo. One gram of lidocaine-prilocaine or placebo cream was applied to the penis under an occlusive dressing for 60 to 80 minutes before circumcision. Blood samples were obtained at various times after drug application for measurements of methemoglobin and plasma lidocaine, prilocaine, and o-toluidine (a metabolite of prilocaine). A total of 68 and 59 neonates were included in the safety and efficacy analyses, respectively. Facial-activity scores were 12 to 49 percent lower during various steps of the procedure in the lidocaine-prilocaine group. Lidocaine and prilocaine were detected in plasma in 23 (61 percent) and 21 (55 percent) of the infants treated with lidocaine-prilocaine cream, respectively.</s><s>To explore techniques that can be utilized in addition to the dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) to further reduce the neonate's stress and pain from routine circumcision, and thus make the procedure more humane. Eighty healthy, term, newborn male infants scheduled for routine neonatal circumcision. Prospective and randomized; double blind and placebo controlled for the study solutions. Each study group differed from the controls in one variable including: 1) using a specially designed, physiologic circumcision restraint chair; 2) pH buffering of lidocaine hydrochloride used for DPNB; and 3) offering a pacifier dipped in a 24% sucrose solution during the DPNB and circumcision. Behavioral observations were recorded and compared for each group starting before the injection of lidocaine hydrochloride and continuing through the completion of the circumcision. The infants who were injected with the buffered lidocaine showed no differences in distress from the controls. When neonatal circumcisions are performed routinely, they should be done as humanely as possible.</s><s>The effectiveness of sucrose as an analgesic agent for newborn infants was assessed during two standard painful hospital procedures: blood collection via heel lance and circumcision. Infants who drank 2 mL of a 12% sucrose solution prior to blood collection cried 50% less during the blood collection procedure than did control infants who had received 2 mL of sterile water. Like findings were obtained for infants who received sucrose on a pacifier prior to and during circumcision. These findings, which parallel results obtained in studies of pain in infant rats, provide a potent yet simple, benign intervention to help alleviate stress and pain routinely experienced by human infants.</s><s>We set out to compare a eutectic mixture of local anesthetic cream (lidocaine and prilocaine) to dorsal penile nerve block with lidocaine for anesthesia during circumcision. Distress scores and heart rates were significantly higher in the eutectic mixture group than in the lidocaine group. Distress scores and heart rates were significantly higher in infants treated with the anesthetic mixture than in infants treated with lidocaine.</s><s>1) To compare the Mogen and Gomco clamps with regard to pain experienced during neonatal circumcision, and 2) to assess neonatal circumcision pain with and without dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB). A randomized, controlled, nonblinded clinical trial; 48 healthy, full-term infants were randomized into one of the following four groups: Gomco vs Mogen with (+) or without (-) DPNB. DPNB+ infants were injected with 0.8 mL of 1% lidocaine before circumcision. Pre- and postcircumcision saliva samples for cortisol analysis were collected. Heart rate, respiratory rate, SaO2, cortisol changes, and duration of crying were evaluated statistically with two-way analyses of variance and t tests. The use of anesthesia but not the type of clamp was significantly associated with percentage of crying time and percentage of SaO2 change during the procedure. Fifty-six percent of infants circumcised with the Mogen clamp and DPNB did not cry at all during the procedure. DPNB is effective in reducing neonatal circumcision pain with either the Mogen or the Gomco clamp.</s><s>To investigate the efficacy and safety of dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) and eutectic mixture of lidocaine (EMLA) for palliation of pain associated with circumcision in low-birth-weight infants. Intensive care nursery (step down unit) at Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, DC. Fifty neonates with weights of 1600 to 2500 g at the time of circumcision who were discharged from the hospital between May 1994 and June 1995 were randomly assigned to the DPNB, EMLA, or control group. Twenty-five infants who were otherwise eligible were excluded because of parental refusal of consent to participate. The control group received sham anesthesia with topical placebo (acid mantle cream). All circumcisions were performed without complication or technical difficulty. Dorsal penile nerve block is safe and effective in controlling pain associated with circumcision in low-birth-weight infants.</s><s>The purpose of the study was to determine the efficacy of music and eutectic mixture of local anesthetics (EMLA) on pain responses of neonates undergoing circumcision. Each infant's state was examined for a potential contribution to the pain response. The heart rate was significantly lower for the EMLA group and remained stable for the music group. Oxygen saturation differences were statistically significant for the music group (P =.02) and approached significance for the EMLA group. Preliminary support was provided for the efficacy of EMLA and music to contribute to the pain relief of neonates undergoing circumcision.</s><s>Our objective was to compare two methods of pain control during neonatal circumcision: a sucrose-dipped pacifier and an analgesic cream (EMLA). The primary data analysis was a 2 x 2 factorial analysis of variance with repeated measures. Physiologic and behavioral parameters indicated significantly (p < 0.05) decreased pain response in all treatment groups compared with that in the control group.</s><s>The effects of a topical anesthetic used prior to newborn circumcision on the parameters of heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation levels, seconds of crying time, and overt generalized reaction to the procedure were investigated. The circumcision was divided into five events with parameters recorded 30 seconds into each event. Seconds of crying time also differed significantly between groups, as did overt generalized response.</s><s>Recognizing the concerns about the use of local anesthesia in neonatal circumcision, a painful procedure usually performed without analgesia or anesthesia, we undertook a study of acetaminophen for pain management of this procedure. Neonates were monitored intraoperatively for changes in heart rate, respiratory rate, and crying time. Postoperative pain was assessed at 30, 60, 90, 120, 360 minutes, and 24 hours using a standardized postoperative comfort scoring system. Feeding behavior was also assessed before and after circumcision by nursing observation. Feeding behavior deteriorated in breast- and bottle-fed neonates in both groups, and acetaminophen did not seem to influence this deterioration. Acetaminophen was not found to ameliorate either the intraoperative or the immediate postoperative pain of circumcision, although it seems that it may provide some benefit after the immediate postoperative period.</s>"

Qualitative differences between lithium carbonate and haloperidol indicate that, while haloperidol has a more dramatically rapid impact on behavior-motor activity, lithium carbonate acted more evenly on the entire manic picture, with total normalization realized during active treatment.</s><s>Zuclopenthixol acetate--a new injectable formulation with a duration of action of 2-3 days--was compared with conventional intramuscular and oral formulations of haloperidol and zuclopenthixol in the initial treatment of acutely disturbed, psychotic patients. The patients were stratified into 3 diagnostic categories: acute psychoses (48 patients), mania (22 patients), and exacerbation of chronic psychoses (73 patients). The ratings of the acute and chronic psychotic patients on the BPRS also showed significant reductions in scores with no differences between treatments. Zuclopenthixol acetate fulfils many desires for an amended neuroleptic formulation for the initial treatment of acutely disturbed psychotic patients.</s><s>Hospitalized manic patients were withdrawn from psychoactive medications for 2 weeks after which they were randomized to double-blind treatment with carbamazepine plus lithium [CBZ-Li] or haloperidol plus lithium [HAL-Li] with benztropine. Standard ratings of psychopathology and side effects were accomplished weekly. Sixty patients entered the study but only 33 remained for randomization after drug washout. We conclude that either combination treatment can be beneficial but CBZ-Li has the advantage because of fewer neurologic side effects.</s><s>This randomized controlled trial compares the efficacy and safety of olanzapine vs haloperidol, as well as the quality of life of patients taking these drugs, in patients with bipolar mania. For the subgroup of patients whose index episode did not include psychotic features, rates of remission were significantly greater for the olanzapine group compared with the haloperidol group (56.7% vs 41.6%, P =.04). Weight gain was significantly greater in the olanzapine group compared with the haloperidol group (2.82 vs 0.02 kg, P<.001). These data suggest that olanzapine does not differ from haloperidol in achieving overall remission of bipolar mania. However, haloperidol carries a higher rate of extrapyramidal symptoms, whereas olanzapine is associated with weight gain.</s><s>In a double-blind, between-patient clinical trial carbamazepine (CBZ) (n = 8) was compared to haloperidol (HP) (n = 9) in patients presenting with mania (DSM III). No serious haematological changes, nor abnormalities in clinical chemistry occurred in either group.</s><s>In a randomized, double-blind trial, patients with acute bipolar mania received 1-6 mg/day of risperidone, 2-12 mg/day of haloperidol, or placebo for 3 weeks, followed by double-blind risperidone or haloperidol for 9 weeks. Of 438 patients, 154 were randomized to risperidone, 144 to haloperidol, and 140 to placebo. At week 3, mean Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) score reductions from baseline were significantly greater in patients receiving risperidone than placebo (p<0.001). Differences between risperidone and haloperidol on this efficacy measure were not significant. We conclude that risperidone monotherapy was an effective and well-tolerated treatment for bipolar mania and that efficacy was maintained over the long term.</s><s>Uncontrolled evidence suggests that divalproex administered via the oral loading strategy of 20 mg/kg/day may produce clinically significant antimanic response within 3 days of treatment in some patients. Response was measured daily by a blind rater using the Young Mania Rating Scale and the Scale for Assessment of Positive Symptoms. The greatest rate of improvement for both drug regimens occurred over the first 3 full days of treatment. Divalproex oral loading may produce rapid onset of antimanic and antipsychotic response comparable to that of haloperidol and with minimal side effects in the initial treatment of acute psychotic mania in a subset of bipolar patients.</s><s>Previous investigations of the treatment of mania have resulted in uncertainty about the efficacy of lithium versus a neuroleptic. The study was conducted in double blind fashion for 3 weeks with the dosages of the medications varied according to clinical response or untoward effects. Groups B and C did not differ from each other, either in degree of improvement or in side effects. Inspite of the relatively small sample size the results suggest (1) that haloperidol is superior to lithium for treating severely ill acute mania and (2) that while a haloperidol--lithium combination does not result in a significant increase in side effects, it is not superior to haloperidol alone.</s>"

Main outcome measurements: Severity of depression assessed with the Bech-Rafaelsen Melancholy Scale (BRMS) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D). Endurance exercise may help to achieve substantial improvement in the mood of selected patients with major depression in a short time.</s><s>To assess whether patients receiving aerobic exercise training performed either at home or in a supervised group setting achieve reductions in depression comparable to standard antidepressant medication (sertraline) and greater reductions in depression compared to placebo controls. Patients underwent the structured clinical interview for depression and completed the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). After 4 months of treatment, 41% of the participants achieved remission, defined as no longer meeting the criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) and a HAM-D score of <8. Patients receiving active treatments tended to have higher remission rates than the placebo controls: supervised exercise = 45%; home-based exercise = 40%; medication = 47%; placebo = 31% (p = .057).</s><s>The Depression Outcomes Study of Exercise (DOSE) was a randomized clinical trial to determine whether exercise is an efficacious treatment for mild to moderate major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults ages 20 to 45 years. The specific hypotheses under investigation were (1) active exercise is an efficacious monotherapy for mild to moderate levels of MDD, and (2) there is a dose-response relation between the exercise amount and reduction in depressive symptoms. Eighty men and women who were diagnosed with a Structured Clinical Interview for Depression and who had mild (HRSD 12-16) to moderate (HRSD 17-25) MDD were randomized to one of five doses of exercise: 7.0 kcal/kg/week in 3 days/week; 7.0 kcal/kg/week in 5 days/week; 17.5 kcal/kg/week in 3 days/week; 17.5 kcal/kg/week in 5 days/week; or 3 days/week of stretching and flexibility exercises for 15 to 20 min/session. Participants exercised under supervision in our laboratory over the course of 12 weeks. The design of the study restricted participant characteristics to mild to moderate MDD and controlled exercise features to permit the evaluation of exercise as a sole treatment for depression.</s><s>To determine whether exercise is effective as an adjunct to antidepressant therapy in reducing depressive symptoms in older people. Secondary outcomes were seen with the Geriatric Depression Scale, Clinical Global Impression and Patient Global Impression. At 10 weeks a significantly higher proportion of the exercise group (55% v. 33%) experienced a greater than 30% decline in depression according to HRSD (OR=2.51, P=0.05, 95% CI 1.00-6.38).</s><s>The effects of two non-drug treatments (physical exercise and bright light) on mood, body weight and oxygen consumption were compared in age-matched groups of female subjects with winter depression, non-seasonal depression or without depression. Neither mood nor metabolic parameters changed significantly in the group of nine untreated winter depressives. One week of bright light treatment (2-h exposure to 2500 lux between 14.00 and 16.00 h) increased oxygen consumption in nine winter depressives and nine non-depressed subjects, while no significant change in oxygen consumption was found in nine subjects with non-seasonal depression. Overall, the results of the study suggest that energy-regulating systems are implicated in the antidepressant action of the non-drug treatments.</s><s>Thirty community-dwelling, moderately depressed elderly were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 interventions: experimenter-accompanied exercise in the form of walking, a social contact control condition, and a wait-list control. These results indicate that, at least in the short term, exercise has a broader effect compared with control conditions in reducing depressive symptoms in the moderately depressed elderly.</s><s>The purpose of this study was to conduct a pilot clinical trial to test the feasibility and efficacy of an exercise program and anti-depressant treatment compared with usual care in improving the emotional and physical functioning of older adults with minor depression. Participants were 37 older adults with minor depression who were randomized to exercise, sertraline, or usual care; 32 participants completed the 16-week study. Outcomes included measures of both emotional (clinician and self-report) and physical (observed and self-report) functioning.</s><s>To assess the benefit and harm of exercise training in adults with clinical depression. The DEMO trial is a randomized pragmatic trial for patients with unipolar depression conducted from January 2005 through July 2007. Patients were referred from general practitioners or psychiatrists and were eligible if they fulfilled the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, criteria for unipolar depression and were aged between 18 and 55 years. Patients (N = 165) were allocated to supervised strength, aerobic, or relaxation training during a 4-month period. At 12 months, the mean differences in HAM-D(17) score were -0.2 (-2.7 to 2.3; p = .8) and 0.6 (-1.9 to 3.1; p = .6) for the strength and aerobic groups versus the relaxation group.</s><s>Two clinical trials have been conducted in a sample of depressed patients to determine whether the addition of an aerobic exercise programme to their usual treatment improved outcome after 12 weeks. A second trial was then conducted to compare an aerobic exercise programme with low intensity exercise. In neither trial was there any correlation between the extent of change in the subjects' physical fitness due to aerobic exercise and the extent of the improvement of psychiatric scores.</s><s>The Regenerate pilot study explored whether a 10-week, community-based progressive resistance training (PRT) program could reduce depressive symptoms in depressed chronic stroke survivors. Participants were screened for depressive status using the PHQ-9 and confirmed by psychiatric assessment. Eligible people (n = 45) were randomised to PRT or a waiting-list comparison group. The PRT program included two high intensity sessions/week for 10 weeks at a community-based gymnasium. At 6-month follow-up, there was a trend for PRT participants to be more likely to be no longer depressed than the comparison group, but the difference was not significant after adjusting for baseline scores. Intervention participants demonstrated significant improvements in strength. To optimize stroke recovery and improve the quality of life of stroke survivors, health professionals should continue to focus on helping survivors' mental health recovery as well their physical rehabilitation.</s><s>The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of 16 weeks of a comprehensive exercise routine to supervised walking and social conversation on depression in nursing home residents with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Depression was reduced in all three groups with some evidence of superior benefit from exercise. Exercise as a behavioural approach to treatment of depression in nursing home residents with severe AD evidenced a clear benefit to participants in this study. More research is needed to clarify the relative benefits of different types of exercise in conjunction with or without pharmacological intervention.</s><s>No controlled trials have evaluated the long term efficacy of exercise activity to improve the treatment of patients with Major Depressive Disorders. The aim of the present study was to confirm the efficacy of the adjunctive physical activity in the treatment of major depressive disorders, with a long term follow up (8 months). The patients that made physical activity had their HAM-D, GAF and CGI score improved from T0 to T8, all differences were statistically significant. In the control group HAM-D, GAF and CGI scores do not show any statistically significant differences between T0 and T8.</s><s>Regular physical exercise may improve a variety of physiological and psychological factors in depressive persons. The subjects were then crossed over to the alternate regimen for an additional 8-week period. The exercise program consisted of five 50-min sessions per week of a group jogging training at a mild intensity. Twenty-four hour excretions of cortisol and epinephrine in urine were reduced due to the exercise regimen. The findings of this study suggest that a group jogging exercise may be effective in improving depressive state, hormonal response to stress and physiological fitness of adolescent females with depressive symptoms.</s><s>Forty-three depressed women were randomly assigned to either (a) an aerobic exercise treatment condition in which they participated in strenuous exercise, (b) a placebo treatment condition in which they practiced relaxation exercises, or (c) a no-treatment condition. Aerobic capacity was assessed before and after the 10-week treatment period. The results indicated that subjects in the aerobic exercise condition evidenced reliably greater improvements in aerobic capacity than did the subjects in either of the other conditions (p less than .002 in both cases) and that the subjects in the aerobic exercise condition evidenced reliably greater decreases in depression than did subjects in the placebo condition (p = .05) or subjects in the no-treatment condition (p = .001).</s><s>Previous observational and interventional studies have suggested that regular physical exercise may be associated with reduced symptoms of depression. To assess the effectiveness of an aerobic exercise program compared with standard medication (ie, antidepressants) for treatment of MDD in older patients, we conducted a 16-week randomized controlled trial. One hundred fifty-six men and women with MDD (age, > or = 50 years) were assigned randomly to a program of aerobic exercise, antidepressants (sertraline hydrochloride), or combined exercise and medication. Growth curve models revealed that all groups exhibited statistically and clinically significant reductions on HAM-D and BDI scores. However, patients receiving medication alone exhibited the fastest initial response; among patients receiving combination therapy, those with less severe depressive symptoms initially showed a more rapid response than those with initially more severe depressive symptoms. An exercise training program may be considered an alternative to antidepressants for treatment of depression in older persons.</s><s>Running versus weight lifting in the treatment of depression.</s><s>Depression in elderly people may be contributed to by the multiple losses of aging. Exercise has the potential to positively impact many of these losses simultaneously. We tested the hypothesis that progressive resistance training (PRT) would reduce depression while improving physiologic capacity, quality of life, morale, function and self-efficacy without adverse events in an older, significantly depressed population. Subjects were randomized for 10 weeks to either a supervised PRT program three times a week or an attention-control group. In a multiple stepwise regression model, intensity of training was a significant independent predictor of decrease in depression scores (r2 = .617, p = .0002).</s><s>Running as treatment for depression.</s>"

A randomized, single-blind clinical trial lasting 18 months conducted at 2 academic medical centers. A total of 439 community-dwelling adults, aged 60 years or older, with radiographically evident knee osteoarthritis, pain, and self-reported physical disability. The resistance exercise group had an 8% lower score on the physical disability questionnaire (1.74 +/- 0.04 vs 1.90 +/- 0.03 units; P=.003), 8% lower pain score (2.2 +/- 0.06 vs 2.4 +/- 0.05 units; P=.02), greater distance on the 6-minute walk (1406 +/- 17 vs 1349 +/- 16 ft; P=.02), faster times on the lifting and carrying task (9.3 +/- 0.1 vs 10.0 +/- 0.16 seconds; P=.001), and the car task (9.0 +/- 0.3 vs 10.6 +/- 0.3 seconds; P=.003) than the health education group. There were no differences in x-ray scores between either exercise group and the health education group. These data suggest that exercise should be prescribed as part of the treatment for knee osteoarthritis.</s><s>Evaluation of a self-management program for patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip or knee. Outcome variables were pain, quality of life, activity restrictions, knowledge about OA, self-efficacy, body mass index (BMI), and mobility measures. Significant MANOVA group x time effects (p < 0.05, one-sided) were found for pain, quality of life, strength of the left M. quadriceps, knowledge, self-efficacy, BMI, physically active lifestyle, and visits to the physical therapist.</s><s>To determine whether a home-based pedometer-driven walking program with arthritis self-management education (Walk +) would increase physical activity, muscle strength, and functional performance in older adults with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee as opposed to arthritis self-management education alone (EDU). Thirty-four community-dwelling adults, aged 60 and older with symptomatic knee OA and self-reported functional impairment. Both groups received 12 hours of the Arthritis Self-Management program over 12 weeks and were followed for an additional 12 weeks. Daily steps walked showed a significant group-by-time interaction (P =.04) after controlling for age. In older adults with symptomatic knee OA, Walk + appears to increase walking, with improvements in muscle strength and walking performance. The use of a home-based pedometer-driven program to increase physical activity, strength, and function in this population warrants further research.</s><s>Twelve forms of Sun-style tai chi exercise have been developed specifically to reduce the symptoms and improve the physical functioning of arthritic patients, and this randomized study examined the changes in symptoms and physical characteristics in older women with osteoarthritis (OA) at the completion of a 12-week tai chi exercise program. Due to a 41% overall dropout rate, 22 experimental subjects and 21 controls completed pre- and post-test measures over a 12 week interval. Outcome variables were physical symptoms and fitness, body mass index, cardiovascular functioning, and perceived difficulties in physical functioning. A longitudinal study with a larger sample size is now needed to confirm the potential use of tai chi exercise in arthritis management.</s><s>To determine whether a home based exercise programme can improve outcomes in patients with knee pain. Interventions: Participants were randomised to four groups to receive exercise therapy, monthly telephone contact, exercise therapy plus telephone contact, or no intervention. Secondary outcomes included knee specific physical function and stiffness (scored on WOMAC index), general physical function (scored on SF-36 questionnaire), psychological outlook (scored on hospital anxiety and depression scale), and isometric muscle strength. The reduction in pain was greater the closer patients adhered to the exercise plan.</s><s>To assess the effect of a home based exercise programme, designed to improve quadriceps strength, on knee pain and disability. 191 men and women with knee pain aged 40-80 were recruited from the community and randomised to exercise (n = 113) or no intervention (n = 78). Secondary measures included visual analogue scales (VAS) for pain on stairs and walking and WOMAC physical function scores. VAS scores for pain also reduced in the exercise group compared with the control group (p < 0.05). A simple programme of home quadriceps exercises can significantly improve self reported knee pain and function.</s><s>We describe a randomized controlled trial of effects of lower-extremity strength training on incidence and progression of knee OA. A total of 221 older adults (mean age 69 years) were stratified by sex, presence of radiographic knee OA, and severity of knee pain, and were randomized to strength training (ST) or range-of-motion (ROM) exercises. Subjects exercised 3 times per week (twice at a fitness facility, once at home) for 12 weeks, followed by transition to home-based exercise after 12 months. Compared with ROM, ST decreased the mean rate of joint space narrowing (JSN) in osteoarthritic knees by 26% (P = not significant). Incident JSN was unrelated to exercise adherence or changes in quadriceps strength or knee pain. The ST group retained more strength and exhibited less frequent progressive JSN over 30 months than the ROM group.</s><s>To compare the effects of concentric and coupled concentric-eccentric isokinetic resistance training on functional capacity and symptoms of patients with osteoarthrosis (OA) of both knees. Patients were randomly assigned to 3 groups: concentric (CON, n = 9), concentric-eccentric (CON-ECC, n = 8), and nontreatment (NONTX, n = 6). However, the NONTX group did not display these marked changes after the 8-week period. The results also indicated that concentric-eccentric training has a greater influence on functional capacity, especially stair climbing and descending, than that of concentric training when compared with NONTX group; however, the improvements in pain measurements were better in the CON group compared with the CON-ECC group after the training.

Data analyses revealed: (1) physical fitness and strength: the SA-CST + ET and ET alone groups had significant improvements in physical fitness compared to SA-CST alone and patients in SA-CST + ET and ET alone had significant improvements in leg flexion and extension compared to SA-CST alone and SC, (2) pain coping: patients in SA-CST + ET and SA-CST alone groups had significant improvements in coping attempts compared to ET alone or SC and spouses in SA-CST + ET rated their partners as showing significant improvements in coping attempts compared to ET alone or SC, and (3) self-efficacy: patients in SA-CST + ET reported significant improvements in self-efficacy and their spouses rated them as showing significant improvements in self-efficacy compared to ET alone or SC.</s><s>To compare 16 weeks of isometric versus dynamic resistance training versus a control on knee pain and functioning among patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). Dynamic group: exercises across a functional range of motion; isometric: exercises at discrete joint angles. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index was used to assess perceived pain, stiffness, and functional ability. In the isometric group, time to perform all 4 functional tasks decreased (P<.05) by 16% to 23%. The improvements in the 2 training groups as a result of their respective therapies were not significantly different.</s><s>To determine whether a multimodal physiotherapy programme including taping, exercises, and massage is effective for knee osteoarthritis, and if benefits can be maintained with self management. Randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial; 140 community volunteers with knee osteoarthritis participated and 119 completed the trial. Physiotherapy included exercise, massage, taping, and mobilisation, followed by 12 weeks of self management. Primary outcomes were pain measured by visual analogue scale and patient global change. Global improvement was reported by 70% of physiotherapy participants (51/73) at 12 weeks and by 59% (43/73) at 24 weeks. The physiotherapy programme tested in this trial was no more effective than regular contact with a therapist at reducing pain and disability.</s><s>To test the effects of a high intensity home-based progressive strength training program on the clinical signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. Forty-six community dwelling patients, aged 55 years or older with knee pain and radiographic evidence of knee OA, were randomized to a 4 month home based progressive strength training program or a nutrition education program (attention control). Thirty-eight patients completed the trial with an adherence of 84% to the intervention and 65% to the attention control. Patients in the strength training group who completed the trial had a 71% improvement in knee extension strength in the leg reported as most painful versus a 3% improvement in the control group (p < 0.01). In a modified intent to treat analysis, self-reported pain improved by 36% and physical function by 38% in the strength training group versus 11 and 21%, respectively, in the control group (p = 0.01 for between group comparison).</s><s>To evaluate the effectiveness of two primary care strategies for delivering evidence based care to people aged 55 or over with knee pain: enhanced pharmacy review and community physiotherapy. 325 adults aged 55 years or over (mean 68 years) consulting with knee pain; 297 (91%) reached six month follow-up. Enhanced pharmacy review (pharmacological management in accordance with an algorithm); community physiotherapy (advice about activity and pacing and an individualised exercise programme); control (advice leaflet reinforced by telephone call). Change in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities osteoarthritis index (WOMAC) at 3, 6, and 12 months. At three months, the mean reductions in pain scores were 0.41 (SD 2.8) for control, 1.59 (3.2) for pharmacy, and 1.56 (3.4) for physiotherapy; reductions in function scores were 0.80 (8.5), 2.61 (9.8), and 4.79 (10.8). Significantly fewer participants in the physiotherapy group reported consulting their general practitioner for knee pain in the follow-up period, and use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was lower in the physiotherapy and pharmacy groups than in the control group.</s><s>This study was designed to evaluate, by means of a randomized controlled trial, the effects of a physical activity program incorporating aerobic, strength, and stretching exercises in individuals with osteoarthritis of the knee. We randomly assigned 137 volunteers ages >/=50 to an experimental group or a control group. The experimental group participated in three 1-hour sessions of supervised exercises per week over a 3-month period. The effectiveness of the program was evaluated using repeated measurements of parameters related to self-reported health status, physical capacity, and joint tenderness.After 3 months, significantly greater improvements were observed in the experimental group than the control group in terms of: arthritis pain (p = 0.02), ability to walk and bend (p = 0.03), aerobic capacity (p < 0.0001), hamstring and low back flexibility (p = 0.003), quadriceps and hamstring strength (p <0.01), and the perception of changes relating to osteoarthritis of the knee and general condition (p < 0.0001).</s><s>To investigate the effects of integrated therapy on the functional status of patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). A total of 140 subjects with bilateral knee OA (Altman grade II) were randomized sequentially into 4 groups (groups I-IV). Patients in groups I-III exhibited increased muscle peak torques and significantly reduced pain and disability after treatment and at followup. Both group II and group III had significant gains in muscular strength after treatment and at followup; group III showed the greatest gains. An integrated therapy deals with the extra- and intraarticular progressive pathologic changes, and kinesiologic management of OA is suggested for the management of knee OA.</s><s>A group of 120 patients with rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis volunteered to be subjects for this study of aerobic versus nonaerobic exercise. Exercise tolerance, disease-related measures, and self-reported health status were assessed. There were no significant between-group group differences in the change scores for flexibility, number of clinically active joints, duration of morning stiffness, or grip strength. Our findings document the feasibility and efficacy of conditioning exercise for people who have rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis.</s><s>To determine whether Tai Chi or hydrotherapy classes for individuals with chronic symptomatic hip or knee osteoarthritis (OA) result in measurable clinical benefits. A randomized controlled trial was conducted among 152 older persons with chronic symptomatic hip or knee OA. Outcomes were assessed 12 and 24 weeks after randomization and included pain and physical function (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index), general health status (Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 12 Health Survey [SF-12], version 2), psychological well-being, and physical performance (Up and Go test, 50-foot walk time, timed stair climb). At 12 weeks, compared with controls, participants allocated to hydrotherapy classes demonstrated mean improvements (95% confidence interval) of 6.5 (0.4, 12.7) and 10.5 (3.6, 14.5) for pain and physical function scores (range 0-100), respectively, whereas participants allocated to Tai Chi classes demonstrated improvements of 5.2 (-0.8, 11.1) and 9.7 (2.8, 16.7), respectively.</s><s>The Arthritis, Diet, and Activity Promotion Trial (ADAPT) was a randomized, single-blind clinical trial lasting 18 months that was designed to determine whether long-term exercise and dietary weight loss are more effective, either separately or in combination, than usual care in improving physical function, pain, and mobility in older overweight and obese adults with knee osteoarthritis (OA). Three hundred sixteen community-dwelling overweight and obese adults ages 60 years and older, with a body mass index of > or =28 kg/m(2), knee pain, radiographic evidence of knee OA, and self-reported physical disability, were randomized into healthy lifestyle (control), diet only, exercise only, and diet plus exercise groups. Secondary outcomes included weight loss, 6-minute walk distance, stair-climb time, WOMAC pain and stiffness scores, and joint space width. Adherence was as follows: for healthy lifestyle, 73%; for diet only, 72%; for exercise only, 60%; and for diet plus exercise, 64%. The diet-only group was not significantly different from the healthy lifestyle group for any of the functional or mobility measures. Finally, changes in joint space width were not different between the groups.</s><s>Few investigations include both subjective and objective measurements of the effectiveness of treatments for osteoarthritis of the knee. Beneficial interventions may decrease the disability associated with osteoarthritis and the need for more invasive treatments. To evaluate the effectiveness of physical therapy for osteoarthritis of the knee, applied by experienced physical therapists with formal training in manual therapy. The treatment group received manual therapy, applied to the knee as well as to the lumbar spine, hip, and ankle as required, and performed a standardized knee exercise program in the clinic and at home. A tester who was blinded to group assignment made group comparisons at the initial visit (before initiation of treatment), 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 1 year. At 1 year, patients in the treatment group had clinically and statistically significant gains over baseline WOMAC scores and walking distance; 20% of patients in the placebo group and 5% of patients in the treatment group had undergone knee arthroplasty.</s><s>To investigate the therapeutic effects of different muscle-strengthening exercises on the functional status of patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). One hundred thirty-two patients with bilateral knee OA (Altman Grade II) were sequentially divided into 4 random groups (GI to GIV). The changes of muscle power of leg flexion and extension were measured with a Kinetic Communicator dynamometer, and patients' functional status was evaluated by visual analogue scale, ambulation speed, and Lequesne index before and after treatment, and at the follow-up 1 year later. The results showed that the patients with OA in each treated group had significant improvement in pain reduction, disability reduction, and in walking speed after treatment and at follow-up when compared with their initial status. Isokinetic exercise caused the greatest increase of walking speed and decrease of disability after treatment and at follow-up. The greatest muscle-strength gain in 60 degrees /second angular velocity peak torques was found in the isokinetic and isotonic exercise groups.</s><s>To evaluate the effects of isokinetic exercise versus a program of patient education on pain and function in older persons with knee osteoarthritis. A randomized, comparative clinical trial, with interventions lasting 8 weeks and evaluations of 12 weeks. An outpatient Veterans Affairs Medical Center clinic and an affiliated university hospital. Patients received either a regimen of isokinetic exercise of the quadriceps muscle three times weekly over 8 weeks or a series of 4 discussions and lectures led by health care professionals. Exercised patients also had improved pain scores for more of the variables measured than those receiving education. Both groups had positive functional outcomes and slightly improved measures of overall status.</s><s>To assess the effectiveness of physical therapy, given either as an individually attended treatment or in a small group format, in terms of pain, physical function, and health related quality of life for patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. After 2 baseline assessments, 126 patients were randomized into one of 3 allocation arms: individual treatments (n = 43), small group format program (n = 40), and waiting list control (n = 43). Assessments included both self-report measures (WOMAC, SF-36) and objective measures of physical performance (gait analysis and muscle strength). There were no significant differences in effectiveness between the 2 physical therapy allocations for any of the measured outcomes. Physical therapy, either as an individually delivered treatment or in a small group format, is an effective intervention for patients with knee OA. Responsiveness to this 8 week intervention was modified by loss of medial joint space width.</s><s>To determine the effectiveness of exercise therapy in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip or knee. A randomized single blind, clinical trial was conducted in a primary care setting. The experimental group also received exercise therapy from a physiotherapist in primary care.

An exercise (EX) group (n = 15) received a thrice-weekly 12-week low intensity exercise program and a weekly educational program, and a minimal treatment (Min RX) group (n = 15) received only the education program. Synovial fluid was obtained in 11 subjects before and after the intervention.</s><s>To design and carry out a randomized controlled trial of a complex, physical therapy based intervention for patello-femoral joint (PFJ) osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee, examining medium to longterm outcomes. The participants, who had knee pain and predominant PFJ OA, were recruited from a large population based study. The study design was a controlled trial using prerandomization and a blind observer, comparing the intervention package with standard nonphysiotherapy treatment. At 5 months post-baseline (10 weeks post-treatment) the treatment group had a small decrease in pain and a significant increase in quadriceps strength of the index knee. After one year there were no significant differences in any outcome measure, most of which had returned towards pretreatment levels.</s><s>This study was designed to determine whether an 8-week isokinetic muscle-strength-training program improved the functional health status of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee joint. Twenty volunteers with osteoarthritis of the knee joint were randomly assigned to either an experimental (n=10) or control (n=10) group. Both groups were pre- and posttest for extension and flexion strength of the right and left legs, the 50-foot walk time, range of motion at the knee joint, the Osteoarthritis Screening Index (OASI), and the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale (AIMS). There was a significant decrease in pain and stiffness, and a significant increase in mobility.</s><s>To investigate physical function in patients with severe osteoarthritis (OA) of the knees during and after a general physical training program. Randomized control trial, blinded observer, follow-up at 3 months and 1 year. Consecutive sample of 25 patients (3 men, 22 women) with OA of the knees according to the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR). Twelve patients received training in groups of 6, twice a week for 3 months. Training focused on general fitness, balance, coordination, stretching, and lower extremity muscle strength, and included a daily home exercise program. Patients participated in 96 of 96 assessments (100%) and in 218 of 280 training sessions (77.9%). From baseline to 3 months, isokinetic quadriceps strength (30 degrees/sec) improved 20% (confidence interval [CI] 2alpha = .05, 8% to 50%) in the least affected leg; isometric strength improved 21%.</s><s>This 8 week randomized, double blind clinical trial compared the effect of a combined home based progressive exercise program and treatment with the nonsteroidal medication oxaprozin to treatment with oxaprozin alone on pain and physical functioning in older community dwelling patients with unilateral knee osteoarthritis (OA). Efficacy variables measured before and after 8 weeks included (1) pain using the Western Ontario McMaster (WOMAC) pain, physical disability, and stiffness subscales and a 10 point visual analog scale (VAS) before and after self-paced walking (SPW) and stepping (SPS) functional tasks; (2) physical function using the time to complete a self-paced 40 m walk (SPW) and 20 cycles of 2 steps (SPS): (3) physical activity level using the Physical Activity Scale for Elderly (PASE); (4) clinical measures of knee functioning (range of motion). These changes were significantly greater (p < 0.05) in the exercise versus sham group.</s><s>To assess the effect of a program of supervised fitness walking and patient education on functional status, pain, and use of medication in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. Data were obtained on 47 of 51 intervention patients and 45 of 51 control patients. An 8-week program of supervised fitness walking and patient education or standard routine medical care. In contrast, controls showed a 17-meter decrease in walking distance relative to their baseline assessment (P less than 0.001). Although changes in scores on the arthritis impact subscale were similar in the two groups (P = 0.093), the walking group experienced a decrease in arthritis pain of 27% (Cl, 9.6% to 41.4%) (P = 0.003). Medication use was less frequent in the walking group than in the control group at the post-test (P = 0.08).

To date, however, there have been relatively few studies that have compared the effects of DRSP 3 mg/EE 30 microg on the general well-being of women with those of other oral contraceptives. To compare the impact of DRSP 3 mg/EE 30 microg with that of levonorgestrel 150 microg/EE 30 microg (LNG 150 microg/EE 30 microg; Microgynon 30) on various parameters associated with well-being in healthy female subjects. Treatment with DRSP 3 mg/EE 30 microg had similar beneficial effects on symptoms of water retention and impaired concentration to LNG 150 microg/EE 30 microg, but was significantly better in alleviating negative affect symptoms during the menstrual phase (median difference in MDQ T score -3; p = 0.027; Wilcoxon rank sum test). The proportion of subjects with acne decreased from approximately 55% to approximately 45% in the DRSP 3 mg/EE 30 microg group, but remained static at approximately 60% in the LNG 150 microg/EE 30 microg group. Somatic and psychological symptoms occurred at the greatest intensity and for most subjects during the menstrual phase of the cycle in both groups. Both drugs had similar cycle control parameters with a tendency towards reduced bleeding with continued use. Emotional well-being was reported improved in 61% and 51% of DRSP 3 mg/EE 30 microg and LNG 150 microg/EE 30 microg users, respectively (p = 0.1190; chi2 test).

Fifty-eight healthy women (18-28 years old) received three cycles of treatment with LNG/EE (n = 30) or NETA/EE (n = 28). The results showed that LNG reduced androgen levels in three compartments--adrenal, ovarian, and peripheral. Despite a 2.2-fold greater relative increase in SHBG with NETA than LNG, bioavailable testosterone (T) was reduced by the same amount with LNG and NETA.</s><s>To evaluate the efficacy of a low-dose oral contraceptive (OC) containing 100 microg of levonorgestrel (LNG) and 20 microg of ethinyl estradiol (EE) compared with placebo for the treatment of moderate acne. Acne lesion counts and clinician global assessment were performed at baseline and at each cycle. Patient self-assessment was carried out at baseline and at cycles 4 and 6; blood pressure and weight were measured at baseline and at cycles 1, 3, and 6. Patients in the LNG/EE group also had significantly better clinician global and patient self-assessment scores than those in the placebo group at cycle.</s><s>In spite of an abundant literature on antiandrogen treatment with cyproterone acetate (CA) there have been no objectively measured results to prove statistically the possible superiority of CA over combined oral contraceptive pills in the treatment of acne vulgaris. The preparations studied were: CA 2 mg + EE 50 micrograms (Diane), CA 2 mg + EE 35 micrograms (Diane mite), Levonorgestrel 150 micrograms + EE 30 micrograms (Neovletta). A woman was eligible for the study if she was found by a dermatologist to have at least eight acne lesions (sum of papules, pustules, cysts and nodules) on her face, was otherwise healthy and without medication. The groups thus constituted were of similar size and comparable with regard to age, degree of acne, and menstrual and contraceptive histories. After only 4 months of treatment the patients on Diane and Diane mite had a significantly greater reduction in the number of acne lesions compared with those on Neovletta.</s><s>To assess the contraceptive efficacy, cycle control and acceptability of two monophasic oral contraceptives containing either 30 micrograms ethinylestradiol plus 150 micrograms desogestrel or 30 micrograms ethinylestradiol plus 75 micrograms gestodene. Of the 595 women enrolled, 274 (86.7%) in the desogestrel/ethinylestradiol group and 227 (81.4%) in the gestodene/ethinylestradiol group completed the six cycles, providing data for 1753 and 1487 treatment cycles, respectively. Pre-existing acne improved in both groups, whereas blood pressure and body weight remained essentially unchanged.</s><s>To investigate the effect of a combiphasic oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol and desogestrel (combiphasic EE/DSG) on acne, compared with a preparation containing ethinylestradiol and cyproterone acetate (EE35/CPA). All reductions were statistically significant (p < or = 0.003) at both cycles 3 and 6, except for nodules at cycle 6 with combiphasic EE/DSG, which probably resulted from differences between the treatment groups at baseline. There were no statistically significant differences between the two treatments. Combiphasic EE/DSG progressively reduced the number and severity of acne lesions during the six cycles of treatment. The reduction in acne with the combiphasic oral contraceptive was comparable to a preparation containing the antiandrogen cyproterone acetate.</s><s>The efficacy and acceptability of two third generation oral contraceptives in Thai women were evaluated in a prospective, open, group-comparative, randomized, multicenter trial of women asking for contraception. In six Family Planning Centers and Outpatient Gynaecological Clinics in urban areas in Thailand, 783 healthy women who were at risk for pregnancy and did not have contraindications to oral contraceptive use were randomly allocated to one of the two study groups. The incidences of irregular bleeding and minor side effects in both groups were very low and decreased after an initial increase in the first cycle. The two oral contraceptives were found to be effective and acceptable in Thai women.</s><s>This study was undertaken to compare the clinical efficacy of second- versus third-generation oral contraceptives in the treatment of acne. At baseline, the two treatment groups did not differ in the mean age, body mass index, acne lesion counts, SHBG, DHEAS, or free and total testosterone. In subjects completing 9 months of therapy, acne decreased by 52.8% in the EE/levonorgestrel group (n = 9) and by 58.5% in the EE/desogestrel group (n = 7) (between groups: P not significant).

Three hundred seventy-seven women were randomized (2:1) to receive EE/CMA (n=251) or placebo (n=126) for six medication cycles. Due to the placebo-controlled, double-blind design of the trial, condoms were supplied for contraception. The median reduction in papules/pustules on the face at Cycle 6 compared with admission was 63.6% (EE/CMA) compared with 45.3% (placebo group). For these skin conditions, the p values for the relative difference between groups vs. baseline were <.05 at Cycles 3 and 6, in favor of EE/CMA. As part of a self-assessment rating, at least 70.5% (EE/CMA) vs. 41.3% (placebo) reported an at least satisfactory improvement of their moderate acne.</s><s>The primary objective was to assess the efficacy, cycle control and tolerability of a monophasic combined oral contraceptive (COC) containing nomegestrol acetate (NOMAC) and 17β-oestradiol (E2). Results were compared to those of a COC containing drospirenone (DRSP) and ethinylestradiol (EE). Scheduled withdrawal bleedings were shorter and lighter among users of NOMAC/E2 and were sometimes absent altogether. Type and frequency of adverse events were similar to those typically reported for COCs. These data show that NOMAC/E2 provides high contraceptive efficacy with acceptable cycle control as well as an overall adverse event profile similar to that of DRSP/EE.</s><s>This double-blind study compared the efficacy and tolerability of a combined oral contraceptive containing 30 microg ethinyl estradiol and 3 mg drospirenone (EE/DRSP; Yasmin) with a triphasic preparation containing 35 microg EE and 0.180, 0.215, 0.250 mg norgestimate (EE/NGM; Pramino, also known as Ortho Tri-Cyclen) in the treatment of acne vulgaris. The combined presence of antiandrogenic and antimineralocorticoid activities of drospirenone is unique to this novel progestin in that these characteristics most closely resemble those of progesterone. Female subjects were randomized to EE/DRSP (n = 568) or EE/NGM (n = 586) for 6 treatment cycles, consisting of 21 consecutive days of hormone intake, followed by 7 hormone-free days. The 2 preparations were comparable as to their decreases in inflammatory lesion count. Evaluation of the effect of treatment by subjects was consistent with that of the investigators.</s><s>One-hundred-and-eighty-three women were enrolled in an open, randomized, multicentre study in which the effects on acne of a low-dose biphasic oral contraceptive containing a daily dosage of 25 micrograms desogestrel and 40 micrograms ethinylestradiol (7 days) and a daily dosage of 125 micrograms desogestrel and 30 micrograms ethinylestradiol (15 days) were compared to Diane-35 containing a daily dosage of 2.0 mg cyproterone acetate and 30 micrograms ethinylestradiol (21 days) during four cycles of treatment. Clinical and photographic evaluation of acne plus laboratory assessments were done before treatment and at the end of cycle 4. No differences were found between the two treatments in the clinical and photographic evaluation. The decrease in 3 alpha-17 beta-androstanediol was statistically significantly more pronounced in the Diane-35 group.</s><s>Acne in women can often be successfully treated by the intake of oral contraceptives containing gestagens with anti-androgenic properties. The primary end point was fulfilled if the number of papules/pustules per half of the face present on admission had decreased by at least 50% in the 12th medication cycle. The relative frequency of women with complete resolution was 16.5% under EE/CMA and 4.3% under EE/LNG at cycle 12. EE/CMA is an efficient treatment for women with mild and moderate papulopustular acne of the face and related disorders, reflecting the well-known anti-androgenic properties of the progestogen CMA.</s><s>A new oral contraceptive has been developed that contains a unique progestogen, drospirenone (DRSP), and that has both antiandrogenic and antimineralocorticoid activity. This multicenter, double-blind, randomized study was completed over 9 treatment cycles. Acne lesions, sebum production, and hair growth on the upper lip, chin, and chest were assessed, as well as levels of total and free testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and luteinizing hormone (LH). At study completion, dermatologists, gynecologists, and subjects gave their overall assessment of the effect of treatment on acne. A comparison of the 2 groups revealed that EE/DRSP was at least as effective as EE/CPA. Both preparations also reduced sebum production and hair growth on the upper lip and chin. A 3-fold increase in the levels of SHBG was observed in both treatment groups, and levels of androgens and LH decreased.</s><s>Acne is a multifactorial disease characterized by androgenic stimulation of sebaceous glands. Therefore, combined oral contraceptives (COCs) containing anti-androgenic progestogens are suitable candidates for acne treatment. This study aimed to show that a COC containing the anti-androgen dienogest (DNG) is superior to placebo and not inferior to a COC containing the potent anti-androgen cyproterone acetate (CPA) in improving mild to moderate acne. For inflammatory lesions, the reduction (+/-SD) rates were -65.6+/-29.9% for EE/DNG, -64.6+/-31.2% for EE/CPA and -49.4+/-41.0% for placebo. EE/DNG was superior to placebo, in spite of the prominent placebo effects, and as effective as EE/CPA in the treatment of mild to moderate acne, thus proving a valid option for the treatment of acne in women seeking oral contraception.</s><s>A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study to investigate the efficacy and safety of the 3 mg drospirenone (drsp)/20 mcg ethinylestradiol (EE) combined oral contraceptive (COC) administered in a 24/4 regimen (24 active tablets and 4 inert tablets per cycle) for the treatment of moderate acne vulgaris. Women who received the 3 mg drsp/20 mcg EE 24/4 COC had greater reductions from baseline in inflammatory, noninflammatory and total lesion counts. The 3 mg drsp/20 mcg EE 24/4 regimen COC was well tolerated and had a safety profile consistent with low-dose COC use. The 3 mg drsp/20 mcg EE 24/4 regimen COC was significantly more effective than placebo in treating moderate acne vulgaris.</s><s>The effect of gestodene 75 micrograms (GTD) versus desogestrel 150 micrograms (DSG) combined with 30 micrograms of ethinylestradiol (EE) on acne lesions and plasma androstenedione (A), total testosterone (T), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and \"free androgen index\" (FAI) was evaluated in an open study on 19 patients aged 18-35 years affected with postpubertal or persistent non-severe acne vulgaris. Before treatment, about 75% of the patients showed one or more signs of biochemical hyperandrogenism, including elevated FAI (57%), elevated A (15%), elevated total T (15%) and decreased SHBG (21%), and there was evidence of inverse correlation between SHBG and acne scores (p < 0.05). The echogenic texture of the ovaries was multifollicular in 55% of the cases. Acne improvement under treatments with estrogen and progestin (EP) could be significantly correlated with the normalization of biochemical hyperandrogenism. In conclusion, the biochemical and clinical efficacy of EE-GTD and EE-DSG indicate that both these preparations can be a good choice in the therapy of acne vulgaris, with a non-significant better clinical result with EE-DSG.</s><s>Acne is a multifactorial disease in which androgens appear to play an important role. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a low-dose oral contraceptive containing 20 microg of EE and 100 microg of LNG for the treatment of moderate acne. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, healthy female subjects (n = 371; >/=14 years old) with regular menstrual cycles and moderate facial acne were randomly assigned to receive EE/LNG or placebo for 6 cycles of 28 days. Patient self-assessments were collected and biochemical markers of androgenicity were also measured. At the end of the study, the number of inflammatory and total lesions was significantly lower with EE/LNG compared with placebo (P <.05). A low-dose oral contraceptive containing EE/LNG is effective and safe for the treatment of moderate acne.</s><s>To evaluate the efficacy of a triphasic, combination oral contraceptive (OC), (norgestimate-ethinyl estradiol), in comparison with placebo in the treatment of moderate acne vulgaris. Two hundred fifty women were enrolled in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of norgestimate-ethinyl estradiol in the treatment of acne vulgaris. Efficacy was assessed by facial acne lesion counts, the investigator's global assessment, and the subject's self-assessment.</s><s>Serum total an unbound testosterone (T) and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels were studied in fifty-four female acne patients before treatment and during the treatment by two different oral contraceptives, the other containing 0.150 mg desogestrel plus 0.03 mg EE and the other 0.150 mg levonorgestrel plus 0.03 mg EE. However, at the same time serum free testosterone fell 60% in both treatment groups.</s><s>To assess the efficacy of the combined oral contraceptive containing 3-mg drospirenone/20-microgram ethinyl estradiol (3-mg drospirenone/20-microgram ethinyl estradiol) administered as 24 consecutive days of active treatment after a 4-day hormone-free interval (24/4 regimen) compared with placebo for the treatment of moderate acne vulgaris. Healthy females aged 14-45 years with moderate acne were randomized in this double-blind study to 3-mg drospirenone/20-microgram ethinyl estradiol (n=270) or placebo (n=268) for six cycles of 28 days. The primary outcome measures of acne lesion counts and Investigator Static Global Assessment scale ratings were assessed at baseline and during cycles 1, 3, and 6. The low-dose combined oral contraceptive containing 3-mg drospirenone/20-microgram ethinyl estradiol administered in a 24/4 regimen significantly reduced acne lesion counts more effectively than placebo and demonstrated greater improvement in the Investigator Static Global Assessment rating of acne. The safety profile was consistent with low-dose combined oral contraceptive use.</s><s>Poor cycle control and tolerability can be reasons for irregular pill intake. Acne was assessed by objective (acne counts) and subjective (no, moderate, mild, severe) acne scoring of the facial area at baseline and treatment cycles 1, 3 and 6. The occurrence rate of irregular bleeding and spotting was statistically significantly higher with 20EE/LNG than with 20EE/DSG (0.18 vs. 0.13; p < 0.05). Thirteen subjects in the 20EE/LNG group and three in the 20EE/DSG group discontinued due to unacceptable bleeding (p < 0.05). There were no differences between groups for the mean total scores of PGWBI or POMS at all time-points. Fewer acne lesions were counted with 20EE/DSG vs. 20EE/LNG after six cycles (p < 0.05). There were no apparent differences between the two groups regarding tolerability and quality of life.</s><s>An excess of androgen is believed to contribute to development of acne in some patients. Two hundred fifty-seven healthy female subjects, 15 to 49 years of age with moderate acne vulgaris, were enrolled in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.

Colchicine produced an early improvement in liver function and immunoglobulin levels.</s><s>Although ursodeoxycholic acid is effective for the treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis, some patients do not respond to this treatment. Twenty-two patients with primary biliary cirrhosis treated with ursodeoxycholic acid (600 mg/day) for 30 months were randomly assigned to two groups: group 1, colchicine (1 mg/day) and ursodeoxycholic acid (n = 10); group 2, ursodeoxycholic acid alone (n = 12). Additional administration of colchicine to ursodeoxycholic acid may be beneficial for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, especially those who respond poorly to ursodeoxycholic acid. It is necessary, however, to further confirm the efficacy of colchicine by examining histological changes and following the patients for longer periods.</s><s>Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and colchicine have beneficial effects in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). The efficacy of colchicine and UDCA in PBC was compared in a 2-year placebo-controlled study (n = 90). There were significantly fewer dropouts for hepatic reasons with UDCA than with placebo. Colchicine improved liver function test results only modestly, whereas UDCA significantly decreased the serum activities of aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyltransferase compared with colchicine and placebo.

However, the mean response with zomepirac was greater than with either 50 or 100 mg of flurbiprofen during the first four hours and lower during the last two hours. At the first hour, acetaminophen plus codeine led to significantly better pain relief than did 100 mg of flurbiprofen. After the first hour, flurbiprofen resulted in greater mean scores than acetaminophen alone or acetaminophen plus codeine, and these differences were significant at the fifth and sixth hours.</s><s>This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study compared the time to onset of analgesia and the analgesic efficacy of two formulations of acetaminophen 1000 mg--an effervescent solution and tablet--in 242 patients with moderate or severe pain following dental surgery. The median time to meaningful pain relief was significantly shorter with effervescent acetaminophen (45 minutes) compared to tablet acetaminophen (60 minutes). No other significant differences were observed between the active treatments. In conclusion, effervescent acetaminophen produces a significantly faster onset of analgesia than tablet acetaminophen.</s>"

The treatment and placebo groups were well matched in physical characteristics, in the severity of pain, duration, nature and accompaniments of their pain, the Arhus low back pain index and in laboratory indices of organ system function. However, subsidiary analyses, concentrating on the current pain component of the Arhus index, painted a slightly different picture, with the benefits seeming, if anything, to be greatest in the H600 group and in patients without more severe pain, radiation or neurological deficit.

However, this did not differ between the Harpagophytum and placebo groups nor was the consumption closely related to the amount of pain. Further analysis, though, revealed that 9 out of 51 patients who received the extract were pain free at the end of treatment compared to only 1 out of 54 patients who received placebo.

A light improvement was found also during a control effected after three months of treatment with tolrestat. The improvement after six months of therapy was mild but significant; therefore the authors conclude that the tolrestat is an useful drug in the treatment of the peripheral diabetic neuropathy in addition to attainment of a better glycemia's control.</s><s>A double blind placebo controlled trial was performed to evaluate the effects of the aldose reductase inhibitor, ponalrestat, on symptomatic diabetic neuropathy. Forty-six patients, 30 of whom were treated with ponalrestat and 16 with placebo, completed the study. Among the fifteen nerve function parameters studied, only trends in favour of ponalrestat were noted for heart rate variation and E/I ratio after 6 months (P = 0.06), but no significant differences between the groups could be demonstrated during the study.</s><s>Tolrestat is an aldose reductase inhibitor that is undergoing extensive clinical investigation for the treatment of diabetic complications including polyneuropathy. The trial was conducted in two phases: a 6-month double-blind, placebo-controlled phase, and a 6-month open-label phase in which most patients were treated with tolrestat. Following the double-blind phase, motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity had significantly deteriorated in the placebo group, which did not occur during treatment with tolrestat.</s><s>The effect of long-term treatment with the aldose reductase inhibitor sorbinil (125 mg daily for 6 mo) was examined in 22 diabetic patients with subclinical abnormalities of nerve function. This was a placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover trial in which each of the two treatment periods lasted 6 mo.</s><s>In a double-blind study we randomized insulin-dependent diabetics (n = 19) into a group (n = 12) given daily 250 mg Sorbinil, a potent aldose reductase inhibitor reported to ameliorate diabetic neuropathy, and another group (n = 7) given placebo for 1 year. Objective, neurophysiological variables (biothesiometry, electromyography, nyctometri) were followed throughout the study and correlated with fibrinolytic variables in blood. We found that Sorbinil did not improve any of the selected neurophysiological variables. We found no effect of Sorbinil on the activity of the fast-reacting inhibitor (PA-I) of plasminogen activator.</s><s>We randomized 497 patients, aged 18 to 56 years with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus for 1 to 15 years' duration, to treatment with sorbinil, an aldose reductase inhibitor, or to a placebo. For the median motor and median sensory nerves, changes in velocities were not significantly different in the two randomized treatment groups. For the peroneal nerve, at the 30-month and maximum follow-up visits, the distribution of changes in nerve conduction velocity showed an overall improvement in the sorbinil group and a decline in the placebo group.</s><s>The present study was conducted to investigate the effect of an aldose reductase inhibitor, epalrestat, on autonomic and somatic neuropathy at an early stage in type 2 diabetic patients by assessing the pupillary light reflex and minimum latency of the F-wave. After 24 weeks, the pupillary light reflex test, cardiovascular autonomic function tests, and nerve conduction study were performed. Minimum latencies of F-wave of median and tibial motor nerves were significantly shortened by epalrestat (P = 0.002 and P = 0.001, respectively); however, no significant effects were observed in motor or sensory nerve conduction velocity.</s><s>In a double-blind placebo-controlled trial the effect of Sorbinil (250 mg daily) on diabetic neuropathy was examined. Two subjects on Sorbinil treatment developed a hypersensitivity reaction and were withdrawn. Metabolic control and severity of neuropathy was not significantly different between groups. No patient entered the trial with neuropathic ulcers but ulceration developed in 4 patients during Sorbinil treatment and in 1 of the placebo group.</s><s>The goal of this study was to determine whether treatment with an aldose reductase inhibitor (ARI) has beneficial effects on asymptomatic cardiac abnormalities in diabetic patients with neuropathy. Coronary artery disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, and valvular heart disease were excluded by clinical evaluation, myocardial perfusion imaging, and echocardiography. After 1 year of ARI treatment, there were increases in resting LVEF (P < 0.02), cardiac output (P < 0.03), LV stroke volume (P < 0.004), and exercise LVEF (P < 0.001). Diabetic patients with neuropathy have LV abnormalities that can be stabilized and partially reversed by ARI treatment.</s><s>One hundred and ninety patients with symptomatic diabetic peripheral neuropathy took part in a double blind multicentre trial of either placebo or tolrestat 200 mg once daily for 6 months. A difference in the improvement of paraesthetic symptoms was found however in favour of the placebo group at 24 weeks (p less than 0.02). Significant improvements in median motor NCV and in the mean NCV of the four motor nerves were also seen in tolrestat treated patients at 24 weeks compared to placebo (p less than 0.05). In addition, significant changes in favour of tolrestat were seen when the number of motor nerves per patient with NCV increased during the trial was analysed (p less than 0.001). Mild reversible elevations of hepatic transaminases were seen in a few patients treated with tolrestat, with no other significant adverse effects.</s><s>The effects of the aldose-reductase inhibitor, tolrestat, on chronic symptomatic diabetic sensorimotor neuropathy were studied during a placebo-controlled, randomised, 52-week multicentre trial. Painful and paraesthetic symptoms were analysed separately: improvement in paraesthetic symptoms were seen at one year (p = 0.04), though painful symptoms improved on both placebo and active therapies. Significant improvement in both tibial and peroneal motor nerve conduction velocities were seen at 52 weeks. Long-term benefit [concordant improvement at 24 weeks maintained until 52 weeks] was seen in 28% of treated patients compared to 5% on placebo (p = 0.001).</s><s>There is reason to believe that diabetic neuropathy may be related to the accumulation of sorbitol in nerve tissue through an aldose reductase pathway from glucose. Short-term treatment with aldose reductase inhibitors improves nerve conduction in subjects with diabetes, but the effects of long-term treatment on the neuropathologic changes of diabetic neuropathy are unknown. In contrast to patients who received placebo, the 10 sorbinil-treated patients had a decrease of 41.8 +/- 8.0 percent in nerve sorbitol content (P less than 0.01) and a 3.8-fold increase in the percentage of regenerating myelinated nerve fibers (P less than 0.001), reflected by a 33 percent increase in the number of myelinated fibers per unit of cross-sectional area of nerve (P = 0.04). The increase in the number of fibers was accompanied by electrophysiologic and clinical evidence of improved nerve function. We conclude that sorbinil, as a metabolic intervention targeted against a specific biochemical consequence of hyperglycemia, can improve the neuropathologic lesions of diabetic neuropathy.</s><s>To evaluate the effects of the aldose reductase inhibitor Ponalrestat (Statil) on diabetic autonomic neuropathy, a double-blind placebo controlled trial was carried out on a group of 34 diabetic patients with documented cardiac autonomic neuropathy. Fifteen patients treated with Statil and 12 with placebo completed the study. Reliability coefficients for cardiovascular reflexes and pupil reflex showed high values, ranging from 60% to 80%.</s><s>Clinical and neurophysiological studies were undertaken, with particular reference to the arms, in 39 patients with diabetic neuropathy. Neurophysiological measurements, particularly of sensory amplitude, were considerably more sensitive than measurements of temperature and vibration sensation and remain of fundamental importance in measuring diabetic neuropathy at an early and potentially reversible stage.</s><s>The effects of the aldose reductase inhibitor ponalrestat (600 mg day-1) on sensory, electrophysiological, and autonomic function were examined in 50 patients with chronic symptomatic, distal symmetrical diabetic neuropathy in a 52-week randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, single-centre study. Ponalrestat was clinically well tolerated and had no significant effect on glycaemic control. The lack of beneficial effects of ponalrestat may in part reflect the advanced stage of the neuropathic process in patients with established symptomatic disease, and the poor reproducibility of current neurophysiological techniques. Firmer knowledge of clinico-pathological correlates allied to improved non-invasive neurophysiological measurement techniques should facilitate the selection of patients for future therapeutic trials in diabetic neuropathy.</s><s>A 2-year randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trial of 250 mg day-1 of the aldose reductase inhibitor Sorbinil in severe symptomatic chronic peripheral neuropathy was performed in 21 diabetic patients. After 2 years the median deterioration in AER in the placebo group was 18.4 micrograms min-1 (range 2.6-64.8 micrograms min-1). The change in AER in the Sorbinil group was +1.25 (-10.7 to +20.4) micrograms min-1, an insignificant change. Muscle capillary basement membrane thickness was measured in only 3 patients in each group and did not alter significantly during the trial. The data suggest that aldose reductase inhibition has effects on platelet reactivity and microalbuminuria.</s>"

In addition, the patients in both groups received an exercise program according to the Brunnstrom's neurophysiologic approach. Goniometric measurements for wrist extension, scale for judging the performance of drinking from a glass, Brunnstrom's stages of recovery for hand, and surface EMG potentials were used for the clinical assessments.</s><s>The study examined the efficacy of functional electric stimulation (FES) and biofeedback (BFB) treatment of gait dysfunction in patients with hemiplegia after stroke. These two therapeutic modalities were tested alone and in combination in a prospective, controlled, randomized trial. The authors hypothesized that in concurrent use, these two modalities would complement one another. Each patient received 30 minutes of treatment three times per week for six weeks, in addition to their general rehabilitation program. The length of time elapsed since the stroke did not prove to be a significant factor.</s><s>Electromyographic feedback was compared with physical therapy for its relative effectiveness in training motor activity in patients with hemiplegia. A cross over design was used, so that each patient served as his own control. Electromyography through auditory and visual display was found effective in improving electromyographic activity, but more limited in training effective function as measured by active range of motion. The activity of physical therapy, using tactile, proprioceptive, visual and communicative modalities, has the capacity for attending and drawing attention to many motor elements, as well as to the complexities of activation of some components concomitantly with the inhibition of others during the training process.</s><s>The study was designed to evaluate the effect of electromyographic (EMG) biofeedback on the recovery of arm function after stroke. The two groups of 20 patients were compared before and after 6 weeks of treatment and at follow-up 6 weeks later.

One patient in the experimental group who was given 12 additional training sessions showed further gains in knee and ankle joint angle measurements during walking.</s><s>A long-term, comparison-group outcome trial with a partial crossover design was carried out on the effects of electromyographic biofeedback (EMGBF) plus physiotherapy (PT) versus PT alone in the treatment of the hemiplegic upper limb in stroke patients who were at least six months beyond the onset of their disability.</s><s>To examine the effects of electromyographic (EMG) biofeedback training on the recovery of gait in the acute phase post stroke. All patients were assessed prior to treatment, after 18 treatment sessions, and at three months follow-up. The study was carried out at Scunthorpe General Hospital in North Lincolnshire. The subjects were acute stroke patients who had been admitted on to the medical and elderly wards. The control group were treated using the same techniques, electrodes were used with this group of patients, but the EMG machine was turned off and faced away from the patient and the therapist to control the placebo effect. A large battery of outcome measures was used for physical and psychological assessment. The physical measures consisted of active movement, muscle tone, sensation, proprioception, mobility and activities of daily living (ADL). Scores on the psychological tests were within normal limits, and there was no difference in performance between the EMG and control groups.</s><s>A controlled group study involving 12 patients was performed with the purpose of comparing the effects of EMG feedback in the (re-)learning of motor control to the effects of a conventional physical therapy procedure (NDT). The therapy was focussed on the improvement of the dorsiflexion function of the foot.</s><s>This was a controlled study of the efficacy of two forms of therapy on upper limb functions of hemiparetic patients--one heavily behavioral and the other based on Bobath therapeutic exercises. It arose from an earlier pilot study comparing EMG biofeedback with physical therapy from which it was concluded that both the elapsed time since the acute stroke and the severity of residual disability were particularly important factors. Ease of delivering care and other socioeconomic considerations become important factors in choosing either or both of these methods.</s><s>Electromyographic biofeedback was compared with simple exercise therapy as to its effectiveness in improving foot-drop in 22 stroke patients. One group of 11 patients underwent 6 weeks of exercise therapy 2 sessions per week for 15 minutes per session; the 2nd group of 11 patients underwent similar therapy with EMG feedback.

Rofecoxib has demonstrated an improved gastrointestinal safety profile compared with nonselective NSAIDs. The aim of this study was to compare the analgesic efficacy and tolerability profile of rofecoxib 50 mg with those of the centrally acting, nonsalicylate, opiate/nonopiate analgesic combination oxycodone/acetominophen 5/325 in patients with pain after dental surgery. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active comparator-controlled study, patients experiencing moderate to severe postoperative pain after extraction of > or =2 third molars (including > or =1 mandibular impaction) received a single oral dose of rofecoxib 50 mg, oxycodone/acetaminophen 5/325 mg, or placebo. Significantly fewer patients in the rofecoxib group (72.2%) took rescue analgesia within 24 hours postdose compared with the oxycodone/acetaminophen group (94.5%; P < 0.001) and the placebo group (96.8%; P < 0.02). Both active treatments were similar with respect to onset of analgesic effect. Both were generally well tolerated; the overall incidence of adverse experiences in the rofecoxib, oxycodone/acetaminophen, and placebo groups was 51.1%, 64.8%, and 48.4%, respectively.</s><s>BACKGROUND: Individual patient meta-analysis to determine the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of single-dose rofecoxib in acute postoperative pain. For each patient the percentage of maximum possible pain relief (%maxTOTPAR) was determined at different time points. RESULTS: In dental pain, for rofecoxib 50 mg (1330 patients) compared with placebo (570 patients) the NNT was 1.9 (95% confidence interval 1.8 to 2.1) for six hours, 2.0 (1.8 to 2.1) at eight, 2.4 (2.2 to 2.6) at 12, and 2.8 (2.5 to 3.1) at 24 hours. For postsurgical pain in one trial (163 patients), the NNT for rofecoxib 50 mg for six hours was 3.9 (2.6 to 7.8), the TTR50 was 5.8 hours, and multiple-dose adverse effects over five days occurred at similar rates with rofecoxib 50 mg and placebo.</s><s>This study assessed the analgesic efficacy of single doses of 4-(nitrooxy)butyl-(2S)-2-(6-methoxy-2-naphthyl) propanoate (AZD3582) in acute postoperative dental pain after the removal of an impacted mandibular third molar (ie, wisdom tooth). In the dose-finding study, 52% (126/242) were women; the mean (SD) age was 25.1 (4) years, mean weight was 69.0 kg, and the mean (SD) body mass index (BMI) was 23.7 (3) kg/m2. In the dose-finding study, the AZD3582 750-, 1500-, and 2250-mg groups were superior to placebo in the primary variables \"time to rescue medication (0-8 hours)\" (hazard ratios [HRs] [95% CIs], 0.17 [0.07-0.42], P < 0.003; 0.23 [0.11-0.50], P < 0.001; and 0.15 [0.06-0.36], P < 0.001, respectively), \"time to meaningful pain relief\" (HRs [95% CIs], 3.42 [1.87-6.25], P < 0.003; 2.49 [1.37-4.50], P < 0.003; and 3.07 [1.70-5.55], P < 0.001, respectively), and MPID (analysis of covariance [ANCOVA] least squares mean [LSM] differences [95% CIs], 25.8 [17.3-34.4], P < 0.003; 20.4 [12.1-28.7], P < 0.003; and 29.3 [20.9-37.6], P < 0.001, respectively). AZD3582 and naproxen did not show any statistically significant differences for the 3 primary variables, except that naproxen was superior to the AZD3582 375-mg dose for the variables time to meaningful pain relief (HR difference, 0.48 [95% CI, 0.29-0.78], P < 0.004) and MPID (difference in ANCOVA LSM, -10.2, [95% CI, -18.2 to -2.2], P < 0.012). The median times to meaningful pain relief were 115 minutes for AZD3582 375 mg, 66 minutes for 750 mg, 85 minutes for 1500 mg, 81 minutes for 2250 mg, and 162 minutes for placebo (P = NS, P = 0.003, P < 0.003, and P < 0.001, respectively). The median time to first rescue medication was 144 minutes for placebo, and <50% of the subjects on any of the AZD3582 doses or naproxen took rescue medication within 8 hours after dosing. The median times to confirmed perceptible pain relief were 45 minutes for AZD3582 500 mg, 40 minutes for 750 mg, and 37 minutes for rofecoxib. AZD3582 750 mg had similar analgesic efficacy as equimolar doses of naproxen, but noninferiority to rofecoxib was not demonstrated.</s><s>To compare the efficacy of a single dose of rofecoxib 50 mg with a single dose of oxycodone/acetaminophen 10/650 mg over 6 h as well as with a multidose regimen of oxycodone/acetaminophen 10/650 mg followed by oxycodone/acetaminophen 5/325 mg over 24 h. Research design and methods: In this double-blind, randomized, two-phase study, patients with moderate to severe pain after surgical extraction of >or= 2 third molars, including one mandibular impaction, were treated with rofecoxib 50 mg, oxycodone/acetaminophen 10/650 mg (singledose phase) followed by 5/325 mg every 6h as needed (multidose phase), or placebo. Primary endpoint for the single dose comparison was TOPAR over 6 h; SPID was the key 24-h endpoint. Onset of analgesic effect, peak analgesic single dose of oxycodone/acetaminophen. 271 patients were randomized to treatment with rofecoxib (n = 121), oxycodone/acetaminophen (n = 120), or placebo (n = 30). For the single dose comparison, rofecoxib-treated patients achieved pain relief at least as effective as oxycodone/acetaminophentreated patients as assessed by TOPAR6 (12.9 vs 11.3, 95% CI on difference = [-0.1, 3.2], p = 0.059). Patients treated with oxycodone/ acetaminophen had a shorter time to onset of analgesia than patients treated with rofecoxib (24 vs 35 min, p < 0.05). Individuals treated with rofecoxib demonstrated a longer duration of analgesic effect than those treated with a Patients on active treatment demonstrated better efficacy than patients on placebo on these prespecified endpoints (p < 0.001 for both comparisons).</s><s>To determine analgesic efficacy of a single oral dose of rofecoxib 50 mg compared with acetaminophen/codeine 600/60 mg, we conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo- and active-comparator-controlled, parallel-group study. Rofecoxib was statistically significantly superior to codeine/acetaminophen with respect to TOPAR4, patient global assessment, peak pain relief, and duration of analgesic effect. The codeine/acetaminophen group had more patients with 1 or more adverse events. Rofecoxib provided superior analgesic efficacy compared with codeine/acetaminophen with fewer gastrointestinal and nervous system adverse events.</s><s>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and indomethacin (INN, indometacin) inhibit both the constitutive (COX-1) and inducible (COX-2) isoforms of cyclooxygenase. The induction of COX-2 after inflammatory stimuli has led to the hypothesis that COX-2 inhibition primarily accounts for the therapeutic properties of NSAIDs. A double-blind, parallel-group study compared the analgesic efficacy of rofecoxib to placebo and ibuprofen in 102 patients with dental pain. In subjects, dose- and concentration-dependent inhibition of LPS-stimulated prostaglandin E2 was observed with both rofecoxib (IC50 [the concentration estimated to produce 50% inhibition], 0.77 micromol/L) and indomethacin (IC50, 0.33 micromol/L). Whereas indomethacin inhibited TXB2, (IC50, 0.14 micromol/L), no inhibition was observed with rofecoxib even at doses of up to 1000 mg. Nonetheless, rofecoxib showed analgesic activity indistinguishable from that observed with ibuprofen, a nonisoform-selective COX inhibitor.</s><s>In recent studies of acute pain and primary dysmenorrhea, rofecoxib, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that selectively targets the cyclooxygenase-2 enzyme, was found to be similar in efficacy to ibuprofen and naproxen sodium. The primary end point assessing overall analgesic effect was total pain relief over 6 hours (TOPAR6). Secondary end points were patient global assessment of response to therapy (PGART) at 6 hours, onset of analgesia, peak analgesic effect, and duration of analgesia. Peak analgesic effect as measured by peak pain relief scores during the first 6 hours was significantly greater in the rofecoxib group compared with the codeine/acetaminophen group (P < 0.001), as was the duration of analgesic effect measured by the time to rescue analgesia (9.6 hours vs 2.3 hours, P < 0.001). Adverse events were reported in 33.0%, 46.1%, and 32.3% of patients treated with rofecoxib, codeine/acetaminophen, and placebo, respectively. The most common adverse events were nausea (6.0%, 25.0%, and 9.7%, respectively) and vomiting (3.8%, 18.3%, and 6.5%, respectively). In this study of moderate to severe postoperative dental pain, the analgesic efficacy of rofecoxib 50 mg was greater than that of codeine/acetaminophen, with a lower incidence of adverse events and nausea.</s><s>Rofecoxib is a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor indicated for the treatment of acute pain, with similar analgesic efficacy to ibuprofen and naproxen sodium. In this double-blind, placebo- and active comparator-controlled, parallel-group study, patients experiencing moderate to severe pain after the surgical extraction of > or = 2 third molars were randomized to receive a single dose of rofecoxib 50 mg, 3 doses of enteric-coated diclofenac sodium 50 mg (50 mg given every 8 hours), or placebo. Patients rated pain intensity, pain relief, and global assessments at prespecified times throughout the 24-hour period after initial dosing. Onset of analgesic effect was determined by using the 2-stopwatch method for confirmed perceptible pain relief. Peak analgesic effect was the maximum pain relief attained during the first 8 hours. The duration of analgesic effect was determined by median time to rescue analgesia use. Overall, 61.3% experienced moderate pain and 38.7% experienced severe pain; 53.1% were female; and the mean age was 23.4 years. The overall analgesic efficacy, as assessed by TOPAR8, of a single dose of rofecoxib 50 mg was significantly greater than a single dose of enteric-coated diclofenac sodium 50 mg (20.5 vs 8.2) and placebo (20.5 vs 5.9). Patient global assessment at 8 hours was also significantly better for rofecoxib compared with enteric-coated diclofenac sodium and placebo. The onset of analgesic effect was significantly more rapid for rofecoxib than for enteric-coated diclofenac sodium and placebo (median times: 31 minutes, >4 hours, and >4 hours, respectively). Overall, both rofecoxib and enteric-coated diclofenac sodium were generally well tolerated, although the rofecoxib group had a significantly lower incidence of clinical and drug-related adverse events than the enteric-coated diclofenac sodium group.</s><s>To determine the efficacy of rofecoxib in post-orthopedic surgery pain, we conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo- and active-comparator-controlled, parallel-group trial. Day 1 patients received placebo, rofecoxib 50 mg, or naproxen sodium 550 mg. Days 2 through 5, the placebo and naproxen sodium groups received placebo, and the rofecoxib group received rofecoxib 25 or 50 mg. Rofecoxib 50 mg was superior to placebo (P < .05) and similar to naproxen sodium for all single-dose measures of pain relief. Rofecoxib 50 mg once daily effectively treated post-orthopedic surgery pain.</s><s>Rofecoxib, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, and dexketoprofen trometamol, a single isomer non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), are available for the treatment of acute pain. The summed, time-weighted pain relief score to 8 h derived from the VRS (TOTPAR 8) was used as the primary outcome variable. No significant difference was demonstrated between Groups RO and DE using TOTPAR 8 as the primary outcome variable. Both drugs were well tolerated and adverse events reported were mild to moderate in severity. Rofecoxib has a longer duration of action as a single dose and gave adequate analgesia for over half of that study group; patients in the dexketoprofen trometamol group needed more rescue analgesia.</s><s>Rofecoxib and celecoxib, selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, have analgesic efficacy similar to that of nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. This study was designed to confirm earlier findings that the overall analgesic efficacy of rofecoxib 50 mg was superior to that of celecoxib 200 mg and to extend the comparison to include celecoxib 400 mg. In this single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-comparator-controlled, parallel-group, single-dose study, patients who experienced moderate or severe pain after surgical extraction of at least 2 third molars received a single oral dose of either rofecoxib 50 mg, celecoxib 400 mg, celecoxib 200 mg, ibuprofen 400 mg, or placebo. A total of 482 patients (358 females, 124 males; mean age, 22.1 years) were enrolled. Time to onset of analgesic effect and peak analgesic effect were similar for rofecoxib 50 mg and celecoxib 400 mg. Rofecoxib also showed significantly greater overall analgesic efficacy than did celecoxib 200 mg (n = 90), including greater TOPAR8 scores (17.2 [0.8] vs 11.5 [1.1]; P < 0.001), faster onset of analgesic effect (P < 0.001), greater peak analgesic effect (P < 0.001 for peak pain relief and peak PID), and longer duration of analgesic effect (P < 0.001). All active treatments produced significantly greater overall analgesic efficacy compared with that of placebo (P < 0.001 for all scores [TOPAR8, TOPAR12, SPID8, SPID12, and patient's global assessment] for all study drugs). In this study, rofecoxib 50 mg provided generally superior overall analgesic efficacy compared with that of celecoxib 400 and 200 mg, including a significantly longer duration of analgesic effect.</s><s>This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study compared the efficacy and tolerability of lumiracoxib (a novel COX-2 selective inhibitor) with rofecoxib, celecoxib and placebo in patients with moderate-to-severe post-operative dental pain. Following third molar extraction, patients received single oral doses of lumiracoxib 400 mg, rofecoxib 50 mg, celecoxib 200 mg or placebo (n = 355). Lumiracoxib demonstrated the fastest onset of analgesia and the longest time to rescue medication use. Lumiracoxib 400 mg provides rapid, effective and sustained relief of post-operative dental pain, comparable or superior to rofecoxib.</s><s>Inhibition of the cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 enzyme has been shown previously to reduce pain and inflammation. Valdecoxib is a new highly selective COX-2 inhibitor with a rapid onset of action and significant analgesic properties. This study compared the analgesic efficacy of valdecoxib and rofecoxib in treating postoperative pain in patients undergoing oral surgery. Efficacy was assessed by the onset of analgesia, pain intensity levels, and pain relief over 24 hours, time-weighted sum of total pain, sum of pain intensity difference, the percentage of patients requiring rescue medication and experiencing regimen failure, and patients' global evaluation. Valdecoxib also demonstrated efficacy that was superior to that of rofecoxib with respect to the percentage of patients requiring rescue medication or experiencing regimen failure (p < or =.05).</s><s>To compare the efficacy and tolerability of rofecoxib, hydrocodone/acetaminophen 7.5 mg/750 mg (H/A) and placebo in treating pain after arthroscopy of the knee. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single dose study enrolling patients experiencing moderate or severe pain after knee arthroscopy. Pain was measured over 24 h. The primary endpoint was total pain relief at 6 h for rofecoxib 50 mg compared with placebo. Although analgesic onset and peak were significantly better for H/A than for both rofecoxib (p < 0.01, p < 0.05, respectively) and placebo (p < 0.05, p < 0.001, respectively), rofecoxib patients used significantly less rescue analgesia (p < 0.001) over 24 h. Rofecoxib also provided better Brief Pain Inventory Severity (p = 0.008) and Interference Domain (p = 0.045) scores at 24 h compared to placebo and had lower 24-h Pain Severity scores than H/A (p < 0.05). Treatments were generally well tolerated, with no significant difference in the frequency of patient-reported adverse events between groups. All treatments were well tolerated, with no significant differences observed.</s><s>Previous data have suggested that rofecoxib, a cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-specific inhibitor, had analgesic effects similar to those of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs when tested in the post-dental surgery pain model. After dental surgery, 151 patients (50.3% women; mean age, 18.3 years; 93.4% white) experiencing moderate-to-severe pain were to receive a single dose of placebo, rofecoxib 50 mg, or ibuprofen 400 mg. Analgesic efficacy was assessed for up to 24 hours postdose using self-administered questionnaires. The results of this study demonstrated that rofecoxib 50 mg was more effective than placebo on all measures of analgesic efficacy. We concluded that rofecoxib was efficacious in the treatment of postoperative dental pain and that COX-2-derived prostanoids play a role in treatment of the pain associated with dental surgery.</s><s>The relative efficacy of rofecoxib, diclofenac sodium, and placebo were compared in the treatment of acute pain after bunionectomy surgery. Patients rated their pain at 16 time points over the first 24 h. Primary endpoint was total pain relief over 8 h (TOPAR8). Pre-specified secondary endpoints on Day 1 included onset of analgesia, peak pain relief, and duration of response. For Part II, supplemental analgesia use with rofecoxib compared to placebo was pre-specified for analysis over Days 2-5, with the focus on Days 2-3. For TOPAR8 scores, rofecoxib 50 mg was significantly more effective than placebo (9.5 vs. 3.7, p < 0.001) and diclofenac (9.5 vs. 5.0, p < 0.001). No significant differences in adverse experiences between treatments were seen. Rofecoxib 50 mg was significantly more effective than placebo on all measures of treatment of post-bunionectomy pain.</s><s>A double-blind randomized controlled trial of rofecoxib and multidose oxycodone/acetaminophen in dental impaction pain.</s><s>Pain is a common complaint, often occurring in conjunction with inflammation. In recent studies, the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor rofecoxib demonstrated analgesic effects similar to those of NSAIDs in the treatment of acute pain and primary dysmenorrhea. Using a patient diary, patients recorded pain intensity, pain relief, and global evaluations throughout the 24-hour period after dosing. The safety profile was assessed on the basis of physical findings, laboratory results, and spontaneous reports of adverse experiences. In addition, rofecoxib's analgesic efficacy was similar to that of ibuprofen (TOPAR8, 18.3 vs. 17.0; P = 0.460), but the duration was longer (P<0.05); with ibuprofen, the time to on set was 24 minutes, peak pain relief score was 2.9, and duration of analgesic effect was 8.9 hours.</s><s>Severe pain after third molar surgery is often encountered and more effective treatment regimes are warranted. The early onset of pain relief for the combination of paracetamol and rofecoxib, compared with rofecoxib alone, could be of great importance when treating acute pain after third molar surgery. After data collection for this study, rofecoxib was withdrawn from the market as a result of reported fatal cardiovascular events. Whether this is relevant for short-term use is unknown, but it has to be considered before rofecoxib may be used for pain relief following third molar surgery.</s><s>These studies assessed the comparative efficacy of rofecoxib and valdecoxib in the treatment of acute postoperative dental pain. Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose studies were conducted in patients undergoing extraction of > or =2 third molars, with > or =1 mandibular impaction, who experienced moderate or severe pain after extraction. These studies were performed before both agents were withdrawn from the market. In study 1, 200 patients were randomized to receive rofecoxib 50 mg, 201 to valdecoxib 20 mg, and 49 to placebo. Most (approximately 58%) patients reported experiencing moderate postoperative pain. In study 2, there were no significant differences in the median time to use of rescue medication or the proportion of patients using rescue medication between active treatments. There were no significant differences in total pain relief at 4 or 8 hours, patients' global assessment, onset of analgesia, or AEs between active treatments in either study. The incidence of clinical AEs in study 1 was similar for rofecoxib 50 mg, valdecoxib 20 mg, and placebo (39.5%, 36.8%, and 49.0%, respectively). In study 2, AEs occurred significantly less frequently with rofecoxib 50 mg compared with placebo (35.3% vs 70.8%, respectively; P<0.01); there was no significant difference between the rate of AEs with valdecoxib 40 mg (50.0%) and placebo.</s><s>The analgesic efficacy of the cyclooxygenase-2 specific inhibitors, valdecoxib and rofecoxib, were evaluated in patients following oral surgery. However, valdecoxib was significantly superior to rofecoxib with respect to mean time-specific pain intensity difference and pain relief scores from 30 minutes to 1.5 hours post dose (P < 0.05).</s>"

The Trichophyton infections were treated effectively in five of nine (56%) patients treated for 1 week and 12 of 14 (86%) patients treated for 2 weeks. In the Microsporum group only one of seven patients treated for 1 week and none of five treated for 2 weeks responded. Terbinafine is well tolerated, and requires 2 weeks of treatment in most patients with Trichophyton scalp infections and 4 weeks or more in Microsporum scalp infections, to achieve a successful clinical and mycological response.</s><s>Tinea capitis, a common clinical pattern of dermatophyte infection in children is becoming a public health hazard in some countries. Several studies have reported terbinafine to be a safe and well-tolerated fungicidal drug for the treatment of this infection. However, the optimal treatment duration for its use in the treatment of tinea capitis caused by Microsporum species has not yet been determined. Mycological cure was obtained in 59% and 57%, respectively, and clinical cure in 76% and 80%. In the griseofulvin group, effective treatment was 88%, mycological cure was 76% and clinical cure 96%. However, these high rates were believed to be due to the high dosage of this drug and the prolonged course of treatment. Although there was no statistical trend between the duration of terbinafine treatment within the groups for complete cure at the end of study, there was a positive correlation between the daily dose of terbinafine (mg x kg(-1)) and complete cure. However, further clinical trials are required in order to optimize the dose regimen to allow higher cure rates to be reached.</s>"

Manual removal of the placenta at cesarean delivery results in more operative blood loss and a higher incidence of postcesarean endometritis.</s><s>To evaluate whether the method of placental removal during cesarean section has an impact on perioperative hemorrhage and maternal infectious morbidity. Participants were assigned to have their placenta removed either manually or spontaneously. The drop in hematocrit was the primary outcome; postpartum maternal infectious morbidity was also assessed. the incidence of postpartum infectious morbidity was also significantly greater in the manual group (RR 15.8, 95% CI 2.19-117.5). Routine manual removal of placenta at cesarean section significantly increases perioperative blood loss and postpartum maternal infectious morbidity.</s><s>This study was designed to evaluate the effects of the placental delivery methods and intraoperative glove changing on postcesarean febrile morbidity.

After informed consent, women who required cesarean were randomly assigned to one of four study groups: 1) no glove change plus manual placental extraction, 2) no glove change plus spontaneous placental delivery, 3) glove change plus manual extraction, and 4) glove change plus spontaneous delivery. Bilateral glove change by both primary and assistant surgeons occurred immediately after delivery of the newborn and before delivery of the placenta.

Of the total, data for 247 adults and 227 children were considered clinically evaluable (CE), and those for 98 children and 98 adults were microbiologically evaluable (ME). The CE subjects were cured if all signs and symptoms resolved at posttherapy (days 11-13) and test-of-cure (days 17-20) visits. The most common pathogens at the pretherapy visit were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and enteric bacilli.

Data for 208 patients were clinically evaluable and those for 90 patients were microbiologically evaluable. The overall clinical response was cure in the clinically evaluable patients, demonstrated by resolution of OE signs and symptoms at the test of cure visit. The overall clinical-microbiological response was cure in the microbiologically evaluable patients demonstrated by both clinical cure and microbiological eradication. For the clinically evaluable patients, equivalent cure rates were obtained between the once-daily ofloxacin-treated and four-times-daily neomycin sulfate/polymyxin B sulfate/hydrocortisone-treated patients (93.8% and 94.7%, respectively).

The treatment was successful for all patients of the NCT group, whereas in one patient from the reference group, the infection did not disappear. The inflammation score improved more rapidly in the NCT group, which resulted in an earlier termination of the therapy. As expected, microbiologic cultures from ear swabs revealed Pseudomonas aeruginosa (58%) followed by Staphylococcus aureus (18%) as the main causative pathogens. NCT appears to be well tolerated and more effective than the therapy using antibiotic component drops. Because of its endogenous nature and its higher efficacy, NCT appears to be a good choice for topical treatment of acute otitis externa.</s><s>To compare the efficacy and safety of polymyxin sulfate 7500 IU/neomycin sulfate 3500 IU/dexamethasone phosphate 0.1% (PN+Dx) otic solution with polymyxin sulfate 7500 IU/neomycin sulfate 3500 IU (PN-Dx) in patients with acute bacterial otitis externa (AOE), in order to determine the possible benefit of the addition of dexamethasone.

Otoscopy was performed at initial randomisation and then at 2 and 4 weeks, the ear assessed for active and inactive disease. Two per cent glacial acetic acid, dexamethasone and neomycin sulphate resolved only 30% (8/27) of infected mastoid cavities compared to only 10% (3/29) on glacial acetic acid (P < 0.07). Glacial acetic acid, dexamethasone and neomycin sulphate is significantly more effective in treating otitis externa when compared with glacial acetic acid.

We therefore recommend that in conjunction with aural toilet, antibiotic/steroid combination is more effective than an antibacterial agent for otitis externa.</s><s>Versus placebo in treatment of acute otitis externa.</s><s>Twenty-seven patients with an initial diagnosis of otitis externa, untreated for the previous 2 weeks, were treated with weekly aural suction toilet and a choice of three topical drops. From this study it would appear that antibiotic-based drops confer no real advantage over boric acid in spirit.</s><s>Acute otitis externa is a common clinical condition accounting for a large proportion of patients attending the otolaryngology department, although milder cases are often managed in primary care. Treatment of the most severe forms of otitis externa involves aural toilet, followed by the application of a topical preparation, commonly in the form of an ear canal dressing.

The incidence of infections was compared with that in a control group of 31 nontreated cirrhotic patients of similar characteristics. We found a significantly lower incidence of infections [1/32 (3.1%) vs. 13/31 (41.9%); P less than 0.005] and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [0/32 (0%) vs. 7/31 (22.5%); P less than 0.05] in patients receiving norfloxacin.</s><s>Low protein concentration in ascitic fluid has been identified as a risk factor for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). One hundred cirrhotic patients with <1.5 g/dl of total protein in ascitic fluid were randomized prospectively, in a double blind fashion to receive ciprofloxacin 500 mg/day (n=50) or placebo (n=50) for 12 months. In the ciprofloxacin group, SBP occurred almost four times less frequently than in the placebo group but it was not statistically significant. The probability of survival at 12 months was significantly higher in patients receiving ciprofloxacin (86% versus 66%) (p<0.04). Patients with cirrhosis and low protein concentration in ascitic fluid are candidates to receive long-term prophylaxis to reduce the risk of infections and improve survival.</s><s>The prognosis of patients with chronic liver disease and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is poor, being of great importance its prevention. To compare the effectiveness of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus norfloxacin for prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. Fifty seven patients with cirrhosis and ascites were evaluated between March 1999 and March 2001. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either 800/160 mg/day of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 5 days a week or 400 mg of norfloxacin daily. In the statistical analysis, differences were considered significant at the level of 0.05. Extraperitoneal infections occurred in 10 patients receiving norfloxacin (31.3%) and in 6 patients receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (24.0%).</s><s>Our aim was to compare weekly rufloxacin with daily norfloxacin in the secondary prophylaxis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and to examine changes in antibiotic susceptibility in fecal Escherichia coli. The method used was an open randomized clinical trial including 79 patients who received either norfloxacin 400 mg/day or rufloxacin 400 mg/week and followed up for one year. E. coli counts, quinolone susceptibility, and drug concentrations in feces were investigated in 12 patients. Cumulative one-year probability of peritonitis recurrence was 26% for patients on norfloxacin and 36% for those on rufloxacin (P = 0.16). In conclusion, weekly rufloxacin is not an alternative to daily norfloxacin in the prevention of peritonitis recurrence.</s>"

Women's satisfaction with pain relief, peroperative pain, clouding of memory and the surgeons' assessment of operating conditions were evaluated. Oxygen saturation levels < 94% were recorded in one woman using isodesox and in 16 (29%) women given intravenous analgesia.</s><s>Acupuncture previously has proved its pain-relieving effect for ovum pick-up (OPU). The analgesic effect of electro-acupuncture (EA) was evaluated when EA was applied for only a few minutes prior to OPU in an attempt to make EA more attractive for clinical use. The primary outcome measure was pain relief; secondary end-points were costs, time to discharge and clinical outcome parameters. Directly after OPU, the EA group reported significantly higher mean and maximum pain, and 'pain now' than the CMA group. A significant difference was found between the EA and the CMA groups regarding pain during the OPU, probably due to the fact that the CMA group was pre-medicated as part of the study design. The procedure is well tolerated by the patients, with a shorter hospitalization time and lower costs.</s><s>Little is known of the effect on oocytes of anesthesia administered during retrieval. We designed a clinical trial to determine the plasma and follicular levels of prolactin and cortisol in patients in an assisted reproduction program. The patients receiving general anesthesia had the greatest increase in prolactin by the end of the procedure. The only significant difference between groups was seen for the rate of gestation of 0% in the group receiving sedation with alfentanil and midazolam before a paracervical block. Plasma increases in prolactin and hormonal responses to follicular puncture were fully attenuated by spinal anesthesia and partially attenuated by the techniques requiring sedation.</s><s>High oocyte retrieval rates using transvaginal follicular aspiration for single follicles and improved laboratory techniques have engendered renewed interest in natural-cycle in vitro fertilization (IVF). Analysis of pain perception using visual analogue scoring showed a similar pain tolerance in both groups for the procedures of vaginal ultrasound scanning, needle insertion, and follicular aspiration. We conclude that one of the benefits of natural-cycle IVF using transvaginal single-follicle aspiration is that it can be performed without analgesia.</s><s>This open label study compared the effectiveness of patient-controlled sedation (PCS), with physician-administered sedation (PAS) during transvaginal ultrasound-guided oocyte retrieval (TUGOR). Number of oocytes retrieved and fertilization, cleavage and clinical pregnancy rates were also recorded. The pain score was higher in the PCS group during (mean +/- SD, 53 +/- 23 versus 35 +/- 24; P < 0.01) and 2 h after the procedure (29 +/- 27 versus 17 +/- 22; P < 0.05). Although PCS provides less analgesia then PAS during TUGOR, it is safe, satisfactory and accepted by patients.</s><s>To observe analgesic effect of acupuncture compound anesthesia for patients of different pain thresholds. The pain thresholds in the acupunc ture compound anesthesia group was determined 30 min before acupuncture on one day before taking ova, and in the simple Dolantin group was determined before injection of Dolantin and 30 min before taking the ova. combined with intramuscular injection of Dolantin, and simple intramuscular injection of Do lantin. For the patients with pain thresholds of 1 mA, 1.5 mA and 2 mA, the cumulative scores of pain in the acupuncture compound anesthesia group were significantly lower than those in the simple dolantin group (P < 0.01, P < 0.05). For the patients with moderate pain thresholds, acupuncture compound anesthesia has good analgesic effect.</s><s>To observe analgesic effect and safety of acupuncture compound anesthesia in transvaginal ultrasound-guided oocyte retrieval. The acupuncture compound anesthesia group was significantly better than the simple Pethidine group in the pain rating and pain score (P < 0.01); the incidence rate of abdominal pain at 1 h and 2-5 h after oocyte retrieval in the acupuncture compound anesthesia group was lower than that in the simple Pethidine group (P < 0.01).</s><s>The primary aims were to compare the pain-relieving effect and post-operative well-being between electro-acupuncture analgesia (EA) and conventional analgesia (CA) comprising opiates. Further aims were to compare time for mobilization, and costs for time and drug consumption. Although VAS pain ratings were significantly higher at oocyte aspiration (P < 0.0001) and after retrieval (P < 0.01) in the EA than in the CA group, they were similar 60 min after surgery. No significant differences in time and costs for drug consumption were noted. An advantage of EA is less post-operative tiredness and confusion compared with CA.</s><s>To evaluate the effects of three different target-controlled remifentanil infusion rates during target-controlled propofol infusion on hemodynamic parameters, pain, sedation, and recovery score during oocyte retrieval. Target-controlled propofol infusion at an effect-site concentration of 1.5 μg/mL was instituted. The patients were randomly allocated to receive remifentanil at an effect-site concentration of either 1.5 (group I, n = 23), 2 (group II, n = 23) or 2.5 ng/mL (group III, n = 23). Hemodynamic variables, sedation and pain scores and the number of patients with the maximum Aldrete recovery score 10 min after the procedure were comparable among the groups. The number of patients in group III with the maximum Aldrete recovery score 5 min after the procedure was significantly lower than that in groups I and II.</s><s>To compare the pain levels during egg collection and the subsequent postoperative side effects in patients receiving a paracervical block (PCB) with and without conscious sedation. The median pain levels during vaginal punctures were 12.0 (2.5th--97.5th centiles: 0--84.3) and 30.0 (2.5th--97.5th centiles: 0--100) in the sedation and placebo groups, respectively. There were no significant differences between the two groups in the severity of nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and drowsiness. Patients who received only a PCB during the egg collection experienced 2.5 times higher levels of vaginal and abdominal pain as compared to those who received both PCB and conscious sedation. The use of PCB along is not recommended for all patients but it may be considered with selected patients after they have been given extensive counseling.</s><s>Although the conventional method of pain relief during outpatient oocyte recovery involves physician-administered drugs, patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) offers an alternative technique with the potential to give women more control over peroperative analgesia. Thirty-nine women were randomized to PCA during egg collection while 42 were allocated to receive intermittent doses administered by a physician. Significantly more fentanyl (97.5 microg) was used in the PCA group than in the other group (84.6 microg) (P = 0.03).</s><s>Assisted reproduction may be associated with repeated occasions of surgical intervention. Propofol, which is frequently used for induction of anaesthesia in such procedures, has been suspected of damaging oocytes. We compared in a randomized prospective design the use of general anaesthesia with fentanyl 0.017 mg/kg, propofol 2.5 mg/kg and isoflurane to that of sedation with midazolam 0.06 mg/kg and ketamine 0.75 mg/kg for transvaginal oocyte retrieval in 50 patients with no premedication. The rate of embryo transfers and pregnancies were not different between the two groups.</s><s>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the anaesthetic effect during oocyte aspiration of a paracervical block (PCB) in combination with either electro-acupuncture (EA) or intravenous alfentanil. Visual analogue scales (VAS) were used to evaluate subjective experiences during oocyte aspiration, and IVF outcome parameters were recorded. Before oocyte aspiration, the level of stress was significantly higher in the EA group than in the alfentanil group (P < 0.05), and the EA group experienced discomfort for a significantly longer period during oocyte aspiration (P < 0.</s><s>In a previous study on the effect of electro-acupuncture (EA) in combination with a paracervical block (PCB) as an analgesic method during oocyte aspiration in IVF treatment, EA appeared to increase the pregnancy rate. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that EA as an analgesic during oocyte aspiration would result in: (i) a better IVF pregnancy rate than with alfentanil; (ii) peroperative analgesia that was as good as that produced by alfentanil; (iii) less postoperative abdominal pain, nausea and stress; and (iv) a reduction in the use of additional analgesics. In this prospective, randomized, multicentre clinical trial, 286 women undergoing oocyte aspiration were randomly allocated to the EA group (EA plus a PCB) or to the alfentanil group (alfentanil plus a PCB). No significant differences were found between the EA and alfentanil groups in any of the IVF variables. No correlation between pregnancy rate and NPY concentrations was found in either analgesic group. After 2 h, the EA group reported significantly less abdominal pain, other pain, nausea and stress than the alfentanil group.</s><s>The aim of this study is to compare plasma remifentanil concentrations and pulmonary function tests in subjects receiving remifentanil infusion (RI) versus RI with paracervical block (PCB) during transvaginal ultrasound-guided oocyte retrieval (TUGOR).

Total amount of remifentanil used were 486 +/- 1.81 microg and 321 +/- 0.87 microg in groups RI and RI + PCB, respectively, (p < 0.05).</s><s>A modified patient-controlled analgesia pump provided doses of propofol 3 mg or midazolam 0.1 mg in 0.3 ml, over 5.4 s, with no lockout, during transvaginal oocyte retrieval. Alfentanil 0.2 mg was administered at three points during the procedure, and on request. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either propofol (25 patients) or midazolam (22 patients). The mean age, weight, duration of procedure and dose of alfentanil were similar in both groups. Thereafter requirements decreased: midazolam 0.065 (0.065) mg.min-1, propofol 2.1 (1.3) mg.min-1. P-deletion, reaction time, and critical flicker fusion tests revealed similar depression in both groups immediately postoperatively.</s><s>Outpatients undergoing minor diagnostic and therapeutic procedures associated with intermittent discomfort are frequently given bolus injections of intravenous opioid analgesics. The average alfentanil dosage requirements were 1.49 +/- 0.50 and 1.46 +/- 0.55 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 (mean +/- SD) in the physician- and patient-controlled groups, respectively. Even with the mandatory lockout interval, intraoperative patient-controlled administration of alfentanil was comparable to physician-controlled administration with respect to patient comfort and satisfaction during vaginal ovum pickup procedures.</s><s>The aim of this study was to compare the pain-relieving effect and the subjective well-being between auricular electro-acupuncture (EA) analgesia, auricular acupuncture (A) and conventional analgesia with remifentanil (CO).

        "Abstracts": "<s>Although two pegylated interferons (Peg-IFN) are available to treat chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, no head-to-head comparative studies have been published. Patients were assigned to PEG 2b (80-150 mug/week; n = 96) or PEG 2a (180 mug/week; n = 86), plus RBV (800-1200 mg/day) for 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was sustained virological response (SVR: negative HCV-RNA 24 weeks after completion of treatment). At baseline, both groups were well balanced: 73% male; 63% HCV genotype 1 or [corrected] 4; 29% had fibrosis index of 3 or greater. Conclusion: In patients with HIV, HCV therapy with PEG 2b or PEG 2a plus RBV had no significant differences in efficacy and safety.</s><s>A randomized, open-label trial was performed to study virological and intracellular interactions between stavudine and ribavirin in 30 patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Plasma HIV RNA levels did not change significantly between baseline and month 3. There was a nonstatistically significant trend for a lower median residual concentration of intracellular stavudine-TP in the treated group, compared with the control group.</s><s>Among HIV-infected persons, chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection causes substantial morbidity and mortality. However, few studies have evaluated the safety and efficacy of interferon alfa (IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) therapy in co-infected persons. Accordingly, a randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter trial was conducted to establish the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of IFN alfa-2b 3 mIU daily plus RBV 800 mg/d compared with IFN alfa-2b 3 mIU thrice weekly (TIW) plus RBV 800 mg/d in HCV treatment-naive, HIV-infected subjects with compensated liver disease and stable HIV disease. After 12 weeks of therapy, 122 (75%) had serum HCV RNA levels assessed; of these subjects, early virologic response (undetectable HCV RNA or >2 log10 decrease from baseline) was observed in 33 (42%) and 13 (16%) of subjects taking daily and TIW IFN, respectively (P < 0.001). However, while no deaths or opportunistic infections were observed, nearly 30% of subjects stopped treatment due to adverse events and 7 subjects experienced a serious adverse event.</s><s>Chronic hepatitis C is common and aggressive in HIV-positive patients, so the development of a well-tolerated HCV therapy is a priority. Fifty-five patients (28 from arm A and 27 from arm B) completed 48 weeks of therapy. At the end of treatment, 20/28 patients in arm A and 11/27 in arm B had HCV-RNA <50 IU/ml. In an intention-to-treat analysis, the SVR was 22% in arm A (genotype 2-3, 11/32; genotype 1-4, 4/37) versus 9% in arm B (genotype 2-3, 3/32; genotype 1-4, 3/34). Thirty patients (15 from arm A and 15 from arm B) dropped out of the trial prematurely due to side effects. The positive predictive value of EVR at week 8 was 65%, the negative predictive value was 86%. The key to successfully improving efficacy is strong compliance through strict overall patient monitoring, in order to best manage drug toxicity.</s><s>Treatment of chronic hepatitis C in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients is associated with low response rates and high incidence of side effects. One hundred twenty-one hepatitis C virus (HCV)-HIV-coinfected patients were randomized to receive interferon alpha-2b (3 MU thrice weekly; n = 61) or peginterferon alpha-2b (1.5 microg/kg/week; n = 60), plus ribavirin (800 mg daily), for 24 (genotype 2 or 3) or 48 weeks (genotype 1 or 4). Hyperlactataemia occurred in 22 patients and was clinically significant in six, two of whom died. mtDNA decreased significantly 4-12 weeks after the start of treatment in patients developing clinically significant hyperlactataemia. Frequent monitoring of virological response may be very helpful to optimize treatment compliance, to tailor treatment duration and to minimize side effects.</s><s>Current therapies for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) in HIV co-infected patients have a low success rate and are poorly tolerated. Patients were assigned to INF (3 x 10 units three times/week) or PEG-IFN (100-150 microg/week) plus RBV (800-1200 mg/day). Duration of treatment was 48 weeks (only 24 weeks for HCV genotypes 2 or 3 and baseline HCV RNA < 800 000 IU/ml). Among patients with genotypes 1 or 4, SVR were 38% versus 7% (P = 0.007) and 53% versus 47% (P = 0.730) for genotypes 2 or 3. CD4 cell count but not its percentage dropped in both arms and HIV RNA viral load did not change from baseline. PEG-INF + RBV was significantly more effective than INF + RBV for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in HIV co-infected patients, mainly of genotype 1 or 4.</s><s>Concurrent potent therapy of hepatitis C (HCV) and HIV includes at least five antiviral drugs. Drug interactions, toxicity, tolerance and acceptance by patients of such treatment regimens are unknown. A prospective open randomized pilot trial was conducted to test interferon-alpha (6 million units/day for the 1st month followed by 6 million thrice weekly) and amantadine versus interferon-alpha monotherapy for tolerability and feasibility among HIV and HCV co-infected patients on stable antiretroviral combination therapy.</s><s>Treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients is a growing concern. Most data on the virologic efficacy and safety of the combination of peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin in coinfected patients come from uncontrolled studies. Patients were enrolled from February 2000 to February 2002 and followed up for 72 weeks. This difference between the treatments was found in patients with HCV genotype 1 or 4 infection (17% for peginterferon vs 6% for standard interferon, P = .006) but was not found in patients with HCV genotype 2, 3, or 5 (44% for peginterferon vs 43% for standard interferon, P = .88). Together, a decline in HCV-RNA of less than 2 log10 from baseline and detectable serum HCV-RNA at week 12 predicted 99% of treatment failures. Histologic activity diminished and fibrosis stabilized in virologic responders. Eleven cases of pancreatitis or symptomatic hyperlactatemia were observed, all in patients receiving didanosine-containing antiretroviral regimens.</s><s>One hundred six HIV-infected patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection were randomized to receive ribavirin (RBV) 400 mg bid plus interferon alpha-2b (IFN-alpha) at two different doses, 3 mU tiw (control arm) or 5 mU daily for the first 6 weeks, followed by 3 mU tiw until completing 6 months of therapy (induction arm). All patients had CD4 counts above 350 cells/microl and 89% were taking antiretroviral therapy. Negative serum HCV-RNA values (< 60 IU/ml) were recorded in 24.7% and 35.5% of patients at 3 and 6 months of therapy. However, in the intent-to-treat analysis, sustained response was reached by only 16% of patients (22.4% in the on-treatment analysis). Patients with HCV genotypes 2 or 3 had a 7-fold higher response rate than those with HCV genotypes 1 or 4.</s><s>Interferon and ribavirin combination therapy for chronic hepatitis C induces a low response rate in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients. To assess the impact of intensification of interferon administration and of the addition of amantadine on the efficacy and safety of standard anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment in HIV-infected patients. Forty-one patients were randomized in group A and 39 in group B. Intention-to-treat analysis showed a sustained virological response, defined as HCV-RNA negativization, 6 months after stopping treatment in 22% of patients from group A and 13% from group B (P>0.05).</s><s>To assess the efficacy and safety of an extended treatment period in HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV)-coinfected patients without early virological response (EVR). Patients achieving EVR at week 12 continued under therapy for an additional 12 or 36 weeks depending on genotype. One hundred and ten patients were included (mean age 38.7 years, mean weight 68 kg, 74% males, 74% on highly active antiretroviral therapy, mean CD4+ T-cell count 564 cells/mm3). Fifty-one patients harboured genotype 1, 44 genotype 2/3, and 15 genotype 4. EVR was achieved in 63.6% (51% in genotype 1, 88.6% in genotype 2/3, 33.3% in genotype 4). Measures to improve adherence to HCV antiviral therapy should be considered when new approaches based on extended periods of treatment are investigated.</s><s>The effects on T-lymphocyte populations of two interferon-alfa-2a (IFN) regimens associated with ribavirin were evaluated in 36 HCV-HIV co-infected patients with chronic hepatitis C, T-CD4 cell count > 250 cells/ micro L and a plasma viral load of < 10 000 HIV RNA copies/mL. Group B (18 patients) received 9 MU daily for 2 weeks, 3 MU daily for 22 weeks, then 3 MU three times a week for the last 24 weeks. Three patients displayed reversible CD4 lymphopenia < 200 cells/ micro L. HIV infection at inclusion was responsible for higher CD3 CD8 HLA-DR T-cell percentages in co-infected patients than in healthy and HCV mono-infected subjects. T-cell sequestration in lymphoid tissues and enhanced apoptosis may account for lymphopenia.</s><s>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is highly prevalent and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality among persons infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The primary end point was a sustained virologic response (defined as a serum HCV RNA level below 50 IU per milliliter at the end of follow-up, at week 72). The overall rate of sustained virologic response was significantly higher among the recipients of peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin than among those assigned to interferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin (40 percent vs. 12 percent, P<0.001), or peginterferon alfa-2a plus placebo (40 percent vs. 20 percent, P<0.001). Among patients infected with both HIV and HCV, the combination of peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin was significantly more effective than either interferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin or peginterferon alfa-2a monotherapy.</s><s>Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a cause of major complications in persons who are also infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, the treatment of HCV infection in such persons has been associated with a high rate of intolerance and a low rate of response. We conducted a multicenter, randomized trial comparing peginterferon plus ribavirin with interferon plus ribavirin for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in persons coinfected with HIV. At week 24, subjects who did not have a virologic response (those who had an HCV RNA level greater than or equal to 60 IU per milliliter) underwent liver biopsy, and medications were continued in subjects with either a virologic response or histologic improvement. Treatment with peginterferon and ribavirin was associated with a significantly higher rate of sustained virologic response (an HCV RNA level of less than 60 IU per milliliter 24 weeks after completion of therapy) than was treatment with interferon and ribavirin (27 percent vs. 12 percent, P=0.03).</s>"

        "Abstracts": "<s>The efficacy of naproxen and paracetamol in relieving uterine cramps has been compared in a sequential trial. The treatments did not differ significantly in a two-sided test in 56 patients. In addition to uterine pain, the effect on episiotomy pain was also estimated at the termination of the trial.</s><s>The analgesic efficacy of oral naproxen and its sodium salt was compared with that of aspirin and codeine in two separate trials involving 140 and 90 patients, respectively, with postpartum uterine pain in a single-dose, parallel, stratified, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind design. With 300 or 600 mg naproxen and with 275 mg naproxen sodium, significant analgesia, measured subjectively by pain intensity differences (PID), was prolonged at least 7 or 8 hr; onset tended to be delayed 2 hr or more. Although time-effect patterns with naproxen sodium and aspirin were different, summed analgesic effects (SPID) showed equal efficacy and superiority over placebo (p less than 0.005).</s><s>A new sequential test has been used to compare the effect of paracetamol and placebo on uterine cramping. The magnitude of the difference in treatment effect was estimated following the sequential test. In addition to the effect on uterine pain, which was the primary variable, the effect on episiotomy pain was also estimated.</s><s>Flurbiprofen (Ansaid, Upjohn), a substituted phenyl propionic acid, is a new analgesic/anti-inflammatory agent. To evaluate its relative efficacy in noninflammatory pain, 159 hospitalized women with moderate or severe postpartum uterine cramps were given single oral doses of 50 mg of flurbiprofen, 650 mg of aspirin, 60 or 120 mg of codeine sulfate, or placebo in a parallel, stratified, randomized block, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. Patients rated pain intensity, pain relief, and side effects in uniform interviews for six hours after treatment. All measures of peak and summed analgesia exhibited significant differences among the five treatments. These findings suggest that flurbiprofen as an analgesic for patients with postpartum uterine pain is equivalent to aspirin and superior to codeine.</s><s>The analgesic efficacy of fendosal, a new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent structurally related to salicylic acid, was compared with that of aspirin and placebo in 100 patients with postpartum uterine pain in a single oral dose, parallel, stratified, randomized, double-blind design. With 650 mg aspirin and with 200 or 400 mg fendosal, but not with 100 mg, analgesic effects, as measured subjectively by mean pain intensity scores, began within 1 hr and had similar time-effect patterns for the first 4 or 5 hr. These results demonstrate the efficacy of single doses of fendosal as well as the dose-dependent magnitude and time course of effects on postpartum uterine pain.</s><s>Anirolac, a new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, was evaluated for relative efficacy, safety, and time course of analgesia. Highest summed analgesic ratings over placebo were induced by anirolac, 100 mg (P less than or equal to 0.001), and naproxen (P less than or equal to 0.001), followed by anirolac, 50 mg (P less than or equal to 0.005). At each assessment after the first hour, anirolac, 50 and 100 mg, and naproxen induced significantly stronger analgesia than did placebo.</s><s>Studies were conducted on postpartum and postoperative patients to estimate the dose-response line of fenoprofen and to contrast it with codeine and placebo. The results indicate that fenoprofen at doses as low as 12.5 mg has analgesic properties. In each of the five studies, the mean value of 100- and/or 200-mg doses of fenoprofen for the variable sum of the pain intensity difference (SPID) was higher than that of 65 mg codeine. In their ability to distinguish codeine from placebo, patients with uterine cramp, episiotomy, or surgical pain did not appear to differ.</s><s>One hundred twenty-one patients with postpartum pain caused by uterine cramp or episiotomy pain were the subjects of a randomized, double-blind, single-dose study of oral nalbuphine (N), 15 mg (N = 39); codeine (C), 60 mg (N = 42); and placebo (N = 40) for analgesia. Two new parameters for determining analgetic effect are introduced: number of dropouts per dose and number of subjects with zero analgetic effect.</s><s>In two double-blind randomized, balanced, single oral dose studies with 140 women, a combination of 800 mg aspirin and 64 mg caffeine (aspirin-caffeine) was compared to 650 mg aspirin and to placebo. In patients with severe episiotomy pain, aspirin-caffeine was more effective than 650 mg aspirin (p less than 0.05) at the second and third hours.</s><s>Ketorolac tromethamine, a new nonsteroidal antiinflammatory analgesic, was evaluated for relative efficacy, safety and time course of analgesia in a stratified, randomized, parallel, double-blind trial. Significant differences (p less than or equal to 0.05, two-tailed) occurred among the 4 treatments for various measurements of summed and peak analgesia. Ketorolac 10 mg was significantly superior to placebo in 5 of 5 major efficacy measurements, and aspirin was significantly superior in 3 of 5. With ketorolac 10 mg and 5 mg and aspirin, analgesia lasted 6 hours, with peak efficacy at 3 hours.</s>"

        "Abstracts": "<s>To determine whether it is possible to improve the surgical success of Molteno implantation by causing a general suppression of collagen synthesis with postoperative oral prednisolone. Twenty-two patients requiring single stage, single-plate Molteno implantation were randomized into two study groups: the control group A and the systemic prednisolone treatment group B. Serum markers of collagen metabolism were monitored. There was a statistically significant decrease in serum markers of collagen synthesis in the group B but not in the group A.</s><s>To compare endoscopic cyclophotocoagulation (ECP) and the Ahmed drainage implant in the treatment of refractory glaucoma. Sixty-eight eyes of 68 patients with refractory glaucoma were prospectively assigned to either ECP or Ahmed tube shunt implantation. Exclusion criteria included eyes that had had previous glaucoma drainage device implantation or a cyclodestructive procedure. The preoperative IOP, 41.32 +/- 3.03 mm Hg (Ahmed) and 41.61 +/- 3.42 mm Hg (ECP) (P = 0.5), and the mean postoperative IOP, at 24 months follow-up, 14.73 +/- 6.44 mm Hg (Ahmed) and 14.07 +/- 7.21 mm Hg (ECP) (P = 0.7), were significantly different from baseline in both groups (P < 0.001). There was no difference in the success rate between the Ahmed Glaucoma Valve and ECP in refractory glaucoma. The eyes that underwent Ahmed tube shunt implantation had more complications than those treated with ECP.</s><s>To report the longer term results of a randomized, clinical trial comparing the 350-mm2 and the 500-mm2 Baerveldt glaucoma implants. Between March 1991 and April 1993, 107 patients with uncontrolled intraocular pressure (IOP) due to non-neovascular glaucoma associated with aphakia, pseudophakia, or failed filters were randomly assigned for surgical placement of either the 350-mm or the 500-mm2 Baerveldt implant at the Doheny Eye Institute. A random-numbers table was used to assign each patient to one of the two groups. Clinical records were reviewed to ascertain postoperative IOPs, visual acuities, number of medications used, and implant-related complications that occurred throughout the follow-up period. The overall success rates were 87% for the 350-mm2 group and 70% for the 500-mm2 group (P = 0.05). Average follow-up was 37 months (range, 1-76 months) for the 350-mm2 group and 34 months (range, 5-77 months) for the 500-mm2 group. Visual acuities, implant-related complications, and average IOPs were statistically indistinguishable between the two groups.</s><s>To verify if partial intraoperative Tenon's capsule resection (PTCR) with adjunctive mitomycin C is effective in developing thin, avascular blebs in eyes undergoing Ahmed glaucoma valve insertion, and to assess the efficacy and safety of this procedure. Ahmed glaucoma valve implant insertion with PTCR (group A) and without PCTR (group B) was performed in neovascular glaucomatous eyes without previous surgery. Patients were examined 1 day, 10 days, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year following the surgery. Intraocular pressure (IOP) and the appearance of the bleb were evaluated at each examination. Appearance of the bleb was classified at both the 1 month mark and last examinations into one of three groups: flat and vascularised; elevated avascular; or elevated and not avascular. 12 months after surgery, the mean IOP was 17.2 (5.0) mm Hg in group A and 18.3 (8.7) mm Hg in group B (p>0.05). At the 1 month and the final follow up, the blebs in all eyes were considered elevated and not avascular. The incidence of a hypertensive phase was lower than reported in previous studies.</s><s>A randomized, prospective study was undertaken to compare the results of the double-plate Molteno implant with those of the anterior chamber tube shunt to encircling band (ACTSEB) procedure, described by Schocket, for eyes with complicated glaucoma. For statistical analysis there were 21 eyes in the ACTSEB group and 19 eyes in the Molteno group, with at least 6 months of follow-up (mean follow-up, 26 months; range, 6 to 49 months). Eyes with aphakia/pseudophakia, uveitis, previous penetrating keratoplasty, previous unsuccessful trabeculectomy, and neovascular glaucoma were evenly distributed between the two groups. Mean preoperative intraocular pressures in the ACTSEB and Molteno groups were 35.2 and 34.6 mm Hg, respectively. Final visual acuity was stable (within one Snellen line of baseline visual acuity) or improved in 10 (48%) of 21 eyes in the ACTSEB group compared with 13 (68%) of 19 eyes in the Molteno group.</s><s>The authors conducted a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial to test whether the Schocket shunt with a larger shunt reservoir surface area would provide a lower final intraocular pressure than the double-plate Molteno implant. However, the Molteno implant produced a statistically lower intraocular pressure at 6 months compared with the Schocket shunt.</s><s>To compare the efficacy of Ahmed glaucoma valve (AGV) implant with and without surface area expansion using pericardial membrane (Preclude) in the treatment of complicated glaucoma. Two (20%) of 10 eyes in the e-AGV group, and 8 (80%) of 10 eyes in the AGV group experienced the hypertensive phase (P = 0.007). Complete success rate was 90% in the e-AGV group and 70% in the AGV group (P = 0.291).</s><s>To evaluate the efficacy and safety of intraoperative mitomycin C (MMC) in eyes undergoing Ahmed Glaucoma Valve implantation. Surgical success was defined according to 2 different criteria: (1) postoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) between 6 and 21 mmHg, with or without antiglaucoma medications, and (2) IOP reduction of at least 30% relative to preoperative values. Success rates in both groups were compared using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and the log rank test. Other outcome measures were mean IOP, number of glaucoma medications, and complications. After a mean follow-up of 12.3 months, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed a probability of success of 59% at 18 months for the MMC group and 61% for the control group when the first criterion for success was used (IOP between 6 and 21 mmHg). There were no significant differences in survival rates between the 2 groups with either criterion (P = 0.75 and P = 0.37, respectively). Mitomycin C did not increase the short- or intermediate-term success rates of Ahmed Glaucoma Valve implantation.</s><s>To compare the short- and intermediate-term results of two commonly used glaucoma surgical procedures, trabeculectomy and Ahmed glaucoma valve implant. Of the 117 patients, 62 were randomized to trabeculectomy and 55 to the Ahmed implant. The cumulative probabilities of success (intraocular pressure <21 mm Hg and at least 15% reduction in intraocular pressure from preoperative level) were 83.6% for trabeculectomy and 88.1% for Ahmed implant (P =.43). However, the Ahmed implant group had a greater adjunctive medication requirement. There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of complications between the two groups. All other results, including success (as defined in this study) and frequency of complications, were comparable between the two groups.</s><s>To determine the effectiveness of the partial ligation of a silicone tube of Ahmed glaucoma valve implantation to prevent early postoperative hypotony. Ahmed glaucoma valve implantation was performed with or without partial ligation in 16 eyes. The incidence of complications and the success rate in each group were compared. In the nonligation group, nine patients (56.3%) had successful intraocular pressure control without any additional medications, whereas intraocular pressure in 12 patients (75.0%) was controlled with or without additional antiglaucoma medications. Early postoperative hypotony occurred in 1 of 16 (6.3%) patients with partial ligation and 4 of 16 (25%) patients without ligation.</s><s>To compare the long-term results of trabeculectomy and Ahmed glaucoma valve implant in the initial surgical management of primary open- and closed-angle glaucoma. Of 123 patients, 64 were randomized to trabeculectomy and 59 to the Ahmed implant. No statistically significant differences between groups were noted for postoperative visual acuity, visual field, anterior chamber depth, and short-term or long-term complications. The cumulative probabilities of success (IOP <21 mm Hg and at least 15% reduction in IOP from preoperative levels) at the final follow-up period (months, 41-52) were 68.1% for trabeculectomy and 69.8% for Ahmed implant (P =.86).</s><s>The authors assess whether adjunctive mitomycin C improves Molteno tube shunt surgery in terms of intraocular pressure (IOP), visual acuity, and complication rates. There was no difference between the groups with respect to age, preoperative IOP, log mean angle of resolution (LogMar) visual acuity, or number of preoperative medications. Except for week 1, there were no differences between the groups at any of the clinic visits with respect to IOP and percent change from baseline IOP. Complications were similar in each group, as were number of postoperative hypotensive agents required. Results of this study are limited by a small number of patients in each group and a fixed dose of MMC.</s><s>Previous studies have suggested that primary double-plate Molteno implantation may be beneficial. Therefore, the authors performed a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the relative effectiveness and safety of single- versus double-plate Molteno implantation. From March 1988 to February 1990, 132 patients who underwent Molteno implantation for medically uncontrollable non-neovascular glaucomas in aphakia or pseudophakia were randomly assigned to receive either single- or double-plate implants.</s><s>The pressure-ridge Molteno implant incorporates a ridge on the proximal episcleral plate to limit aqueous outflow during the immediate postoperative period. Six of 15 eyes from the pressure-ridge implant group experienced shallow or flat anterior chambers with hypotony, whereas 5 of 15 eyes from the suture-ligation implant group had significant postoperative pressure spikes. Because the ridge effect is unpredictable, further modifications are necessary to prevent postoperative hypotony.</s><s>To investigate the long-term therapeutic effect of Hunan aqueous drainage (HAD) implantation with and without adjunctive intraoperative mitomycin C (MMC) for refractory glaucoma. The IOP was lowered from preoperative (46.8 +/- 14.5) mmHg to postoperative (16.8 +/- 11.3) mmHg at the 1st year after surgery. The success rate with MMC and without MMC were 90.0%, 77.3% (P < 0.05) at the 1st year, 87.1%, 67.3% (P < 0.05) at the 2nd year, 83.3%, 61.1% (P < 0.05) at the 3rd year, 81.3%, 56.7% (P < 0.05) at the 4th year, and 75.0%, 50.0% (P < 0.05) at the 5th year using Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis. The most frequent complications for long-term follow-up included elevated IOP (IOP > 22 mmHg) (19.8%), the iris adherent to the proximal orifice of the tube (15.5%), developed cataract formation (12.9%) and so on (P > 0.05).</s>"

Forty patients were assigned to Group 1 (21 males, 19 females) and 37 to Group 2 (22 males and 15 females). Thirteen patients in Group 2 (35%) developed nausea, with 10 patients (27%) having an average of two emeses and three (8%) requiring nasogastric intubation (P = 0.80). Abdominal distention was observed in 13 patients (32%) in both Group 1 (32%) and Group 2 (35%). These data support that nasogastric decompression is not necessary following elective colorectal surgery for malignant and premalignant lesions.</s><s>One hundred thirty-eight consecutive patients undergoing elective colonic resections were treated prospectively and randomly with either a long intestinal (Cantor) tube preoperatively, a nasogastric tube placed intraoperatively, or no gastrointestinal tube at all.</s><s>Until relatively recently, the nasogastric (NG) tube has been used routinely for decompression in the patient with small- or large-bowel anastomosis. Excluded were patients with chronic bowel obstruction, peritonitis, gross fecal contamination or spillage, and previous abdominal or pelvic irradiation. Patients in the no-NG group had earlier bowel sounds, return of flatus, oral intake and first bowel movement. Four patients (8%) in the no-NG group, compared with one patient (2%) in the NG group, required subsequent decompression.</s><s>To assess the need for routine nasogastric decompression after extensive resections in patients with gastric cancer. Over a 1-year period (July 1999-July 200), 136 patients with gastric cancer who underwent radical gastrectomy with D2 or more lymph node dissection.</s><s>The objective of this study is to compare early (24-hour) removal of nasogastric tubes (NGTs) in trauma patients who have undergone emergency celiotomy to removal based on clinical signs of return of bowel function. Failure of NGT removal was defined as pain, abdominal distention, and vomiting. Mechanisms of injury, Injury Severity Score, operative findings, NGT removal times, morbidity, laboratory data, and reasons for failure were evaluated. Of the remaining 175 patients, 151 sustained penetrating injuries and 24 sustained blunt injuries. There were three failures in the study group [3 of 68 patients (4.4%)] and three failures in the control group [3 of 83 patients (3.6%)]. Overall failure rate for the study group was 5.1 per cent [(3+1)/(68+10) = 5.1%] versus 4.1 per cent for the control group. Injury severity score, morbidity, and lab values were not significantly different.</s><s>The value of nasogastric tube decompression after elective abdominal operations was assessed in a randomised trial in which 97 patients were and 100 were not allocated postoperative nasogastric decompression. A postal questionnaire to 259 UK general surgeons (96% replied) revealed that postoperative nasogastric decompression was usually used by 92% of surgeons after a Polya gastrectomy, 72% after a small bowel anastomosis, 49% after a large bowel anastomosis and 20% after cholecystectomy. We conclude that such a routine is not justified and should be reserved for those patients developing specific complications.</s><s>To discuss the clinical significance of postoperative gastrointestinal decompression in operation on lower digestive tract. Three hundred and sixty-eight patients with excision and anastomosis of lower digestive tract were divided into two groups, i.e. the group with postoperative gastrointestinal decompression and the group without postoperative gastrointestinal decompression. Clinical therapeutic outcome and incidence of complication were compared between two groups. Furthermore, an investigation on application of gastrointestinal decompression was carried out among 200 general surgeons. Both groups had a lower girth before operation than every day after operation. Nobody (0%) deemed it unnecessary for placing gastrointestinal compression after operation.</s><s>Fifty-six patients undergoing elective colonic resection were prospectively randomized into two groups either with or without postoperative nasogastric decompression. Other morbidity and mortality and hospital stay were the same in both groups.</s><s>Intraperitoneal drains and nasogastric tubes in elective cholecystectomy.</s><s>To determine the need for prophylactic nasogastric decompression following laparotomy and the influence of cimetidine, 200 consecutive patients who underwent major abdominal procedures were prospectively randomized into one of four limbs: no tube-placebo; no tube-cimetidine; tube-placebo; and tube-cimetidine. Patients were evenly distributed among these groups with respect to age, sex, alcohol and tobacco use, previous operations, and types of operations. Duration of postoperative stay increased from 11.4 to 14.1 days in the intubated patients (p less than 0.05). There was also significantly more pain with and frequency of swallowing, and nose/throat discomfort in the tube group. Cimetidine did not affect either the incidence of vomiting or the duration of intubation, but was associated with a significant increase in pneumonias (p less than 0.05). There were no cases of aspiration pneumonia, gastric dilatation, or wound dehiscence in the trial, and the four anastomotic leaks were divided equally between the tube and no-tube groups.</s><s>To evaluate the feasibility, safety, and tolerance of early feeding in patients undergoing surgery for gynecologic malignancies. Variables assessed included nausea, vomiting, time to first passage of flatus and stool, time elapsed before adequate tolerance of a regular diet, postoperative stay, and complications. The types of tumor, the surgical procedures performed, and the operative times were similar in both groups. Hindered deglutition and nasal soreness caused by the nasogastric tube were observed in 88% of patients in arm B. Insertion of a nasogastric tube was necessary in six patients in arm A (10%), and three of these had postoperative complications. Early feeding is feasible and well tolerated and is associated with reduced postoperative discomfort and a more rapid recovery in patients undergoing major surgery for gynecologic malignancies.</s><s>Tubeless post-operative care of elective cases of duodenal ulcer: a controlled study of 170 cases.</s><s>Patient comfort after upper abdominal surgery. Effect of routine nasogastric suction.</s><s>Nasogastric (NG) decompression after colorectal surgery is practiced commonly. Our aim was to determine whether routine NG decompression benefitted patients undergoing this type of surgery. Five hundred thirty-five patients were randomized prospectively to either NG decompression or no decompression. Excluded were patients who had emergency surgery with peritonitis, extensive fibrous adhesions, enterotomies, previous pelvic irradiation, intra-abdominal infection, pancreatitis, chronic obstruction.</s><s>To evaluate the feasibility, safety, and tolerance of early removing gastrointestinal decompression and early oral feeding in the patients undergoing surgery for colorectal carcinoma. Variables assessed included the time to first passage of flatus, the time to first passage of stool, the time elapsed postoperative stay, and postoperative complications such as anastomotic leakage, acute dilation of stomach, wound infection and dehiscense, fever, pulmonary infection and pharyngolaryngitis. The median and average days to the first passage of flatus (3.0+/-0.9 vs 3.6+/-1.2, P<0.001), the first passage of stool (4.1+/-1.1 vs 4.8+/-1.4, P<0.001) and the length of postoperative stay (8.4+/-3.4 vs 9.6+/-5.0, P<0.05) were shorter in the experimental group than in the control group. On the contrary, it may increase the incidence rate of fever, pharyngolaryngitis and pulmonary infection. These strategies of early removing gastrointestinal decompression and early oral feeding in the patients undergoing colorectostomy are feasible and safe and associated with reduced postoperative discomfort and can accelerate the return of bowel function and improve rehabilitation.</s><s>Nasogastric tube (NGT) decompression after abdominal surgery is still largely used to prevent nausea and vomiting. In this prospective and randomized study, we evaluated the effects of early withdrawal of NGTs in patients undergoing surgery of the infrarenal aorta. Between October 2001 and May 2002, consecutive patients underwent scheduled infrarenal aortic operations. Patients were prospectively randomised into two groups: group 1, NGT maintenance until the passage of flatus; and group 2, NGT removal at the time of tracheal extubation. There was no statistical difference between groups regarding nausea and vomiting. In group 1, the occurrence of respiratory complications was more frequent compared with group 2 (5 vs 0 complications; P = .023).</s><s>Surgeons routinely use nasogastric (NG) tubes in most esophageal resection surgeries. The variables recorded for each patient included the first day of gas passage, defecation and bowel sounds (BSs) auscultation, as well as the duration of postoperative hospitalization, nausea and vomiting, abdominal distension, pulmonary complications, wound complications, anastomosis leak, and the need for placing/replacing the NG tube. The routine application of NG tubes after surgery is not recommended for all patients. We suggest that NG tubes should be used according to the specific problems of each patient.</s><s>A randomized prospective trial comparing three established methods of gastric decompression after vagotomy.</s><s>To evaluate the effect of tube decompression of the stomach after elective colorectal operations, 97 patients were randomly allocated to postoperative treatment with or without nasogastric tubes. The frequencies of postoperative complications were small in both groups and without any difference between groups.</s><s>The value of routine nasogastric tube (NGT) decompression after elective hepatic resection has not been investigated. Of 200 patients who had elective hepatic resection, including 68 who had previously had colorectal surgery, 100 were randomized to NGT decompression, where the NGT was left in place after surgery until the passage of flatus or stool, and 100 to no decompression, where the NGT was removed at the end of the operation. There was no difference between patients who had NGT decompression and those who did not in terms of overall surgical complications (15.0 versus 19.0 per cent respectively; P = 0.451) medical morbidity (61.0 versus 55.0 per cent; P = 0.391), in-hospital mortality (3.0 versus 2.0 per cent; P = 0.640), duration of ileus (mean(s.d.) 4.3(1.5) versus 4.5(1.7) days; P = 0.400) or length of hospital stay (14.2(8.5) versus 15.8(10.8) days; P = 0.220). Previous abdominal surgery had no influence on the need for NGT reinsertion.</s><s>To find out if routine nasogastric tube decompression is necessary after radical gastrectomy with systematic extensive lymphadenectomy in patients with gastric cancer. Patients who were not intubated mobilised more quickly, and spent less time in hospital. Routine postoperative nasogastric decompression is unnecessary after radical gastrectomy even in the presence of gastric outlet obstruction.</s><s>Anastomotic disruption of the Roux-en-Y esophagojejunostomy after total gastrectomy is an infrequent complication that may lead to severe morbidity and mortality. However, no studies have compared routine vs no placement of an NJT in patients undergoing total gastrectomy for gastric cancer, to our knowledge. Two hundred thirty-seven patients undergoing total gastrectomy for gastric cancer were randomly assigned to NJT placement (NJT group) or not (no-NJT group). There were no differences between the 2 groups in the mean+/-SD time to passage of flatus (4.6 +/- 1.3 and 4.5 +/- 1.7 days, respectively) or to starting a liquid diet (7.8 +/- 2.6 and 7.7 +/- 1.6 days, respectively), postoperative length of hospital stay (13.5 +/- 7.3 and 13.9 +/- 10.9 days, respectively), postoperative pain, or postoperative abdominal distention.</s><s>Nasogastric decompression following abdominal aortic aneurysmectomy or bypass, for 3-4 days, is a routine part of postoperative care in many centers. Patients were divided evenly between removal of the nasogastric tube upon tracheal extubation and retention of the tube until the passage of flatus. Preoperative risk factors, aortic cross-clamp time, estimated blood loss, length of procedure, length of intensive care unit stay, numbers of days with nasogastric tube, number of days until clear liquid and regular diets commenced, and the length of hospital stay were recorded for all patients. There were no significant differences in any of the measured variables between the two groups.</s><s>To evaluate the effect of nasogastric decompression after extensive intra-abdominal surgery in gynecologic oncology patients. The nasogastric and orogastric groups were similar in age, case distribution, surgery length, and blood loss. The nasogastric group had significantly longer times to first passage of flatus and tolerance of a clear liquid diet than did the orogastric group. However, both groups were similar in time to tolerance of a regular diet and hospital stay. No patient in the orogastric group required a nasogastric tube postoperatively, but one patient in the nasogastric group had a nasogastric tube reinserted for recurrent nausea and vomiting. There were no known anastamotic complications or aspirations in either group. Postoperative changes in hematological indices and electrolytes were comparable in both groups. As a result of this study, we have eliminated postoperative nasogastric decompression except in highly selected circumstances, such as extensive bowel surgery in patients with prior irradiation or substantial edema from bowel obstruction.</s><s>Is nasogastric aspiration really necessary following cholecystectomy?</s><s>Nasogastric decompression has been routinely used in most major abdominal operations to prevent the consequences of postoperative ileus. A prospective randomized trial included 84 patients undergoing elective partial or total gastrectomy. Gastrointestinal function, postoperative course, and complications were assessed. No significant differences in postoperative mortality or morbidity, especially fistula or intra-abdominal sepsis, were observed between the groups. Duration of postoperative perfusion (P = 0.02) and length of hospital stay (P = 0.03) were also significantly longer in the Tube Group. Insertion of a nasogastric or nasojejunal tube was necessary in 5 patients in the No-tube Group (12%).</s><s>Despite some evidence that gastric decompression may be unnecessary after some abdominal operations and in the treatment of paralytic ileus, the use of nasogastric suction after extensive abdominal operations, particularly intestinal resection, remains a subject of some debate. Postoperative loss of fluid from the intestine was significantly greater in the patients undergoing routine nasogastric drainage, although the requirement for intravenous fluid therapy was the same in both groups. There were no significant differences between the two groups in the incidence of postoperative complications. Routine nasogastric aspiration after gastric or intestinal resection does not confer significant advantages to outweigh its discomfort and potential morbidity for patients and should be replaced by selective intubation when required postoperatively.</s><s>This prospective, randomized controlled trial was undertaken to evaluate the effect of tube decompression of the stomach after surgical procedure on the digestive tract. Moreover, abdominal distension, pyrosis, otalgia, dysphagia, odynophagia and atelectasis occurred more often in intubated patients as shown by chi-square analysis of the data with Yates correction, with the level of significance at p = less than 0.05. Tube decompression of the stomach does not relieve intestinal paralysis after digestive operations.</s><s>Nasogastric tube (NGT) is routine employed after abdominal surgery still in our country and abroad too, but the patients' discomfort is severe and several serious complications were referred as related to its use. The aim of this study was to evaluate the pros and cons of routine use of NGT in elective uncomplicated abdominal surgery. In order to evaluate the routine use of NGT we performed a prospective randomized trial on 100 patients who had elective uncomplicated abdominal surgery: 50 subjects had the early removal of NGT and in 50 patients it was maintained until passage of flatus/feces.</s><s>There is a widespread belief that nasogastric decompression in gastric cancer surgery allows better surgical field and leads to the reduction of postoperative complications. From March to June 2000, 119 patients with gastric adenocarcinoma were randomized into either a tubeless group (n=56) or an intubated group (n=63). Exclusion criteria included a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and pyloric obstruction. These results suggest that gastric cancer surgery can be performed safely without nasogastric decompression.</s><s>In reports on earlier non-prospectively randomized trials the authors have claimed that early oral postoperative feeding is a unique benefit of laparoscopic surgery. Patients were randomized after the operative procedure into one of two groups. Group II (n = 95): In this group the nasogastric tube was removed when the surgeon considered that postoperative ileus had been resolved. The incidence of vomiting and nasogastric tube insertion (21.5%) was higher in patients in group I than in those in group II. The time until the first bowel movement was 4.3 days in group I and 4.7 days in group II. Complications appeared in 17.3% of the patients in group I and in 19.3% in group II. This study has objectively demonstrated that early oral feeding is feasible and safe in patients who have elective colorectal surgery.</s><s>In a previous, prospective, randomized study of the use of nasogastric tubes in patients undergoing elective abdominal colorectal surgery, we found that patients who did not have nasogastric (NG) decompression postoperatively had a significantly higher rate of abdominal distention, nausea, and vomiting. Patients from that study have now been followed for a median duration of 5.3 years to evaluate whether this elevation in perioperative intra-abdominal pressure would subsequently lead to an increased incidence of incisional hernia.</s><s>To determine which type of patient should receive routine postoperative nasogastric decompression (NGD), we observed 76 patients who were randomized into two groups: those who received routine NGD (n = 39) and those who received selective NGD (n = 37). Eighteen patients in the selective NGD group never required intubation, while 19 did require intubation within a mean of 3 days after surgery. The return of bowel function, return to a regular diet, and postoperative length of hospital stay were similar in both groups. Fifty-eight percent of patients in the selective NGD group who required intubation had had major vascular or retroperitoneal dissections.</s>"

Patients were randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive ranitidine, 50 mg intravenously, or placebo at the time of decision to proceed to cesarean section. In addition, all patients received 30 mL of 0.3 M sodium citrate on entry into the operating room. Preextubation, 17 patients (5.6%) were at risk in the citrate-alone group and 1 patient (0.3%) was at risk in the ranitidine/citrate group (P < 0.05). We conclude that 50 mg of intravenous ranitidine given at the time of decision to proceed to cesarean section reduces the risk of acid aspiration provided that at least 30 min have elapsed from injection to induction of anesthesia.</s><s>We report the results of a study comparing two dose regimens of the gastric antisecretory agent, omeprazole, used as prophylaxis against pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents during general anaesthesia for elective Caesarean section.

The gastric content was sampled 10 min (n = 52), 50 min (n = 52) and 80 min (n = 24) later. Before extubation, the stomach was completely emptied and the naso-gastric tube removed. On each sampling time, the pH was measured with a digital pHmeter; a search for biliary salts (pyloric reflux) was carried out with thin layer chromatography; the volume of the gastric content was measured using the phenol red dilution method. However, the citrate solution increased significantly the volume of the gastric content. It was respectively 51.1 +/- 29.9 ml, 79.15 +/- 70.9 ml and 32.9 +/- 22.1 ml; 29.6 +/- 28.5 ml; 26.6 +/- 10.9 ml).</s><s>Thirty-two healthy term parturients undergoing elective cesarean section randomly received either no antacid (n = 10), 30 ml of 0.3 molar sodium citrate less than 60 min preoperatively (n = 11), or 30 ml of 0.3 molar sodium citrate longer than 60 min preoperatively (n = 11). Immediately after delivery, the stomach was emptied as completely as possible through a #18 Salem Sump tube passed orally. No patient in the short interval group had a combination of both pH of less than 2.5 and a volume exceeding 25 ml.

METHODS; We conducted an open-label, randomized, controlled trial at a neonatal unit of a public hospital in northern Italy on 101 term neonates undergoing heel lance with an automated piercing device for routine neonatal screening for congenital disorders. Newborn infants were randomly assigned to breastfeeding during blood sampling or to the oral administration of 1 mL of 25% sucrose solution. Median Premature Infant Pain Profile scores were lower in the breastfeeding group (3.0) than in the sucrose-solution group (8.5), and the median group difference was -5.0. There were no significant differences in the sampling duration and numbers of heel lances.</s><s>To investigate whether breast feeding is effective for pain relief during venepuncture in term neonates and compare any effect with that of oral glucose combined with a pacifier. Median pain scores (interquartile range) for breast feeding, held in mother's arms, placebo, and 30% glucose plus pacifier groups were 1 (0-3), 10 (8.5-10), 10 (7.5-10), and 3 (0-5) with the Douleur Aiguë Nouveau-né scale and 4.5 (2.25-8), 13 (10.5-15), 12 (9-13), and 4 (1-6) with the premature infant pain profile scale. Analysis of variance showed significantly different median pain scores (P<0.0001) among the groups. There were significant reductions in both scores for the breast feeding and glucose plus pacifier groups compared with the other two groups (P<0.0001, two tailed Mann-Whitney U tests between groups). Breast feeding effectively reduces response to pain during minor invasive procedure in term neonates.</s><s>The aim of the present study was to test analgesic effects of double- versus single-dose breast milk and compare this effect with efficacy of double- versus single-dose sucrose in a group of healthy term newborns during heel prick blood sampling. Crying times were 117 s, 126 s, 82 s, 128 s, 117 s, and 95 s in groups 1-6, respectively (P= 0.053). The mean pain scores were 4.60, 5.82, 3.91, 4.94, 5, and 4.05 in groups 1-6, respectively (P= 0.068). There was a significant difference between the single-dose sucrose group and single-dose sterile water group at 1 min (P= 0.002). The babies in the sucrose group were active awake, whereas the ones in the breast milk group were asleep before heel prick. Two milliliters breast milk does not reduce response to pain during minor painful procedures in term neonates even when two doses have been given.</s><s>This study identifies a behavioral and nonpharmacologic means of preventing newborn pain. To determine whether breastfeeding is analgesic in newborn infants undergoing heel lance-a routine, painful, hospital procedure. Hospital maternity services at Boston Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, and Beverly Hospital, Beverly, Massachusetts. Infants in the control group experienced the same blood test while receiving the standard hospital care of being swaddled in their bassinets. Breastfeeding is a potent analgesic intervention in newborns during a standard blood collection.</s><s>The aim of this study was to compare the analgesic effect of 2 ml 25% sucrose and human milk in a group of healthy term newborns. The median values of crying time, recovery time and percentage change in heart rate at 1, 2 and 3 min were recorded in response to the heel prick. Median crying times were 36, 52, and 62 s in the sucrose, placebo and human milk groups, respectively (P = 0.0009). In the sucrose group, there was a significant reduction in crying time compared to human milk and placebo groups.</s><s>The purpose of the present study was to examine and compare the analgesic effects of breast feeding and sucrose solutions in reducing pain due to venipuncture in term neonates. Allocation of the infants into groups was performed due to mothers' wishes whereas the control group included the infants on whom routine procedures of the hospital were performed. In order to assess the pain response of the neonates before, during and after venipuncture, Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS) was used and their heart rates, oxygen saturation levels and length of crying were noted. The mean heart rate did not significantly differ among three groups before, during and after procedure. During procedure, the mean oxygen saturation levels of sucrose group were found significantly higher than the control group, but no difference was observed between sucrose and breast feeding groups. This study has confirmed some well known information that breast feeding and oral sucrose solution have pain reducing effects in infants undergoing venipuncture.</s><s>The aims of this study were to compare the pain reducing effect of oral glucose with that of being breast-fed shortly before venipuncture in newborns, and also the pain score and crying time with parents' assessment. 120 full term newborns undergoing venipuncture randomly assigned to on of four groups: I, Breast-fed and 1-ml placebo; II, Breast-fed and 1-ml 30% glucose; III, Fasting and 1-ml placebo; and IV, Fasting and 1-ml 30% glucose. There was no significant difference in PIPP score between the infants who were fed and the fasting infants. The median crying times during the first 3 min in groups I, II, III, and IV were 63, 18, 142 and 93 s, respectively. There was low agreement between the parents' assessment of pain and the PIPP score and crying time.</s><s>This study aimed to compare the effects of mother's milk, sucrose and pacifier use to overcome pain during painful interventions to the newborns on the crying time and pain. Various non-pharmacological methods are used to overcome the pain associated with painful interventions with newborns. A prospective, randomised, controlled study involved 120 newborns in Turkey. Data collection was performed using an information form on the newborn characteristics, which was developed by the researchers in the light of literature, clinical IR ear thermometer ET1 for temperature measurement, OXIMAX N-65 Pulse oxymeter for oxygen saturation and heart rate and neonatal infant pain scale for the measurement of the behavioural responses of newborns. The results indicate that all three practices reduce the behavioural responses to pain at a higher rate than in the control group.</s><s>Sucrose has been shown to have an analgesic effect in preterm and term neonates. Relative crying time and recovery time were significantly less in the sweetener group but not in the glycine and the breast milk group. The artificial sweetener used in our study reduces pain reaction to a heel prick in term neonates, and thus provides an alternative to sucrose. In contrast, glycine tends to increase pain reaction whereas breast milk has no effect.</s><s>Analgesic effects of breastfeeding on heel lancing.</s><s>There is evidence that newborn babies feel pain even at the lowest gestational ages when they can survive. Because sweet solutions such as sucrose, given orally, may relieve pain in neonates, we decided to compare the effects of two concentrations of glucose (normally used for intravenous infusions) and of breast milk in a randomized controlled trial in 120 babies requiring heel-prick tests. Glucose solutions and breast milk are readily available in the neonatal department.</s><s>A randomized study was done to compare non pharmacological methods to reduce the pain of heel pricks in 104 stable term neonates. Duration of cry and Douleur Aiguë du Nouveau né (DAN) score were used to assess pain. At 30 seconds after the stimulus, the pain scores were lowest in the sucrose group but this was not sustained at 1, 2 and 4 minutes. A calm or sleeping state before a painful procedure also appears to decrease crying and pain scores.</s><s>Breastfeeding may be useful for relieving procedural pain experienced by neonates. The sample of this randomized clinical trial study consisted of 60 full-term newborns: 31 in the experimental group and 29 in the control group. The experimental group was breastfed 5 minutes before, during, and for 5 minutes after the blood collection procedure. The duration of breastfeeding was prolonged in comparison to previous studies. This study innovates from earlier studies in 4 respects: the different phases of the procedure were evaluated separately; the breastfeeding intervention covered the period from 5 minutes before the blood collection until the end of recovery; sleep-wake state was fully assessed (not merely crying) and the sucking frequency in the experimental group was assessed during the procedure. The conclusion was that breastfeeding was effective in reducing pain caused by blood collection for newborn screening.</s><s>The effectiveness of skin-to-skin contact to decrease pain from heel-lancing in healthy term neonates and whether breastfeeding in addition to skin-to-skin contact provided a more effective analgesia than skin-to-skin contact alone were investigated. A randomised, controlled trial was conducted in 107 neonates undergoing heel-lance. Physiological responses to pain were measured by heart rate and oxygen saturation changes and behavioural responses were measured by duration of crying and grimacing. There was no significant difference between the groups in clinical characteristics and time spent squeezing the heel. Breastfeeding in the 1st 2 postnatal days with skin-to-skin contact did not increase the analgesic effect of skin-to-skin contact alone.</s><s>Pain experience can alter clinical outcome, brain development, and subsequent behavior in newborns, primarily in preterm infants. The aims of this study were (1) to evaluate several simple, commonly used methods for pain control in newborns and (2) to evaluate the concordance between behavioral and autonomic cardiac reactivity to pain in term neonates during heel-lancing. Outcome measures included the Neonatal Facial Coding System score; cry duration; and autonomic variables obtained from spectral analysis of heart rate variability before, during, and after heel-lancing.

Median crying time, duration of the first cry, percent change in heart rate, maximum heart rate and neonatal facial coding system scores were recorded to assess the infants' response to pain. Statistically significant differences between the three groups were not found in terms of crying time, duration of the first cry, percent change in heart rate or maximum heart rate (P = 0.19, P = 0.08, P = 0.22 and P = 0.91, respectively).</s><s>To assess the effectiveness of expressed breast milk (EBM) in reducing pain due to venepuncture, in term neonates, as measured by behavioural and physiological observations.

There was no difference in the baseline characteristics of the neonates in the two groups. The mean duration of crying in EBM group was shorter by 70.7 (95% confidence interval 36.6-104.9) s. The modified NFCS at 0, 1 and 3 min was significantly lower (p < 0.01) in the EBM than in the DW group.

Symptom scores were assessed initially, and at one, three, six, nine, and 12 months after treatment. At 12 months, 14/20 (70%) pneumatic dilatation and 7/22 (32%) botulinum toxin treated patients were in symptomatic remission (p=0.017). Pneumatic dilatation resulted in significant (p<0.001) reduction in symptom scores, and lower oesophageal sphincter pressure, oesophageal barium column height, and oesophageal diameter. Botulinum toxin produced significant reduction in symptom scores (p<0.001), but no reduction in objective parameters.</s><s>Despite a high success rate, pneumatic dilatation for achalasia is accompanied by a significant risk of esophageal perforation. Direct comparisons of the two techniques are needed to define their role in clinical management. We compared pneumatic dilatation to botox for patients with achalasia using a double blind, randomized study design. Patients underwent clinical, manometric, radiographic and endoscopic evaluation to confirm primary achalasia. They were randomized to receive either 80 units of botox into the LES or Witzel balloon dilatation. Of the 18 patients randomized to Witzel dilatation, 16 (89%) of 18 remained in clinical remission. Although both treatments had excellent initial clinical improvement, patients randomized to Witzel dilatation had superior long-term success ( < 0.01). Initial therapy with Witzel dilatation is associated with better long-term outcome than a single injection of botox.</s><s>Intrasphincteric injection of botulinum toxin has been suggested as an alternative treatment modality in esophageal achalasia.

One month after injection, symptoms had improved in all patients treated with botulinum toxin (symptom score, 0.9 +/- 0.6 vs. 5.5 +/- 1.4; P < 0.02). No significant difference in symptom score and esophageal function test results was found between patients treated with botulinum toxin injections and those undergoing dilation.

Although patients in group I were all extubated early after the end of surgery (85 +/- 35 min), the lowest value of SvO2 after extubation was always greater than 60%.</s><s>The goal of this randomized study was to determine whether combined general and epidural anaesthesia with postoperative epidural analgesia, compared with general anaesthesia and postoperative intravenous analgesia, reduced the incidence of perioperative myocardial ischaemia in patients undergoing elective aortic surgery. One group (EPI, n = 48) received combined general and epidural anaesthesia and postoperative epidural analgesia for 48 hrs. An event that lasted > 60 sec but returned to the baseline for > 60 sec and then recurred, was counted as two separate events. The Holter tapes were reviewed by a cardiologist blind to the patient's group. Mesenteric traction produced the largest number of ischaemic (GA = 11, EPI = 11) events.</s><s>The efficacy and effects of epidural analgesia compared with patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) have not been reported in patients undergoing major vascular surgery. Forty patients classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 2 or 3 received general anesthesia plus postoperative PCA using morphine sulfate (group PCA; n = 21) or general anesthesia plus perioperative epidural morphine-bupivacaine (group EPI; n = 19) during a period of 48 h. During operation, EPI patients received 0.05 mg/kg epidural morphine and 5 ml 0.25% bupivacaine followed by an infusion of 0.125% bupivacaine with 0.1% morphine (0.1 mg/ ml); group PCA received 0.1 mg/kg intravenous morphine sulfate. Respiratory inductive plethysmographic data were recorded after tracheal extubation. Nurse-administered intravenous morphine and time to tracheal extubation were less in group EPI, as were visual analog pain scores at rest and after movement from 20 to 48 h. Complications and the duration of intensive care unit and hospital stay were comparable. There was a similar, low incidence of postoperative apneas, slow respiratory rates, desaturation, and S-T segment depression.</s><s>The aim of this study was to evaluate differences in electrogastrographic activity and serum gastrin secretion in patients subjected to general anesthesia (GA) vs blended anesthesia (BA = GA plus epidural analgesia) for abdominal aortic surgery. Gastrin levels were tested under fasting conditions and after a standard meal. EGG shows gastric electrical activity that parallels gastric motor activity. The power ratio (postprandial/fasting total power) was exceedingly high (>4) in 53% of the GA patients and in 11% of the BA patients (P<0.05). Thus, the latter procedure seems to affect gastric function less than GA alone.</s><s>Improvement in patient outcome and reduced use of medical resources may result from using epidural anesthesia and analgesia as compared with general anesthesia and intravenous opioids, although the relative importance of intraoperative versus postoperative technique has not been studied. One hundred sixty-eight patients undergoing surgery of the abdominal aorta were randomly assigned to receive either thoracic epidural anesthesia combined with a light general anesthesia or general anesthesia alone intraoperatively and either intravenous or epidural patient-controlled analgesia postoperatively (four treatment groups). A uniform surveillance strategy was used for the identification of prospectively defined postoperative complications. Outcome evaluation included postoperative hospital length of stay, direct medical costs, selected postoperative morbidities, and postoperative recovery milestones. Length of stay and direct medical costs for patients surviving to discharge were similar among the four treatment groups. Epidural patient-controlled analgesia was associated with a significantly shorter time to extubation (P = 0.002). Postoperative pain scores were also similar among the four treatment groups.</s><s>Fifty patients undergoing elective abdominal aortic surgery were randomised to receive either combined epidural and general anaesthesia and postoperative epidural analgesia (CEGA) or general anaesthesia and postoperative intravenous morphine infusion (GA). This included intraoperative cardiovascular changes and postoperative complications. The use of intraoperative vasopressors was significantly higher in the CEGA group (P < 0.01) but the use of intravenous glyceryl trinitrate was significantly lower (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference between groups in regard to blood loss, volume replacement or in the number of patients requiring postoperative ventilation.</s><s>To test the hypothesis that epidural anesthesia and postoperative epidural analgesia decrease the incidence of death and major complications during and after four types of intraabdominal surgical procedures. For abdominal aortic surgical patients, unlike the other three types of surgical patients, the overall incidence of death and major complications was significantly lower in group 2 patients (22%) than in group 1 patients (37%), stemming from differences in the incidence of new myocardial infarction, stroke, and respiratory failure between the two groups. Overall, group 2 patients received significantly less analgesic medication but had better pain relief than group 1 patients. The effect of anesthetic and postoperative analgesic techniques on perioperative outcome varies with the type of operation performed. Epidural anesthesia and epidural analgesia improve the overall outcome and shorten the intubation time and intensive care stay in patients undergoing abdominal aortic operations.</s><s>In a primary analysis of a large recently completed randomized trial in 915 high-risk patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, we found no difference in outcome between patients receiving perioperative epidural analgesia and those receiving IV opioids, apart from the incidence of respiratory failure. We found no difference in outcome between epidural and control groups in subgroups at increased risk of respiratory or cardiac complications or undergoing aortic surgery, nor in a subgroup with failed epidural block (all P > 0.05). No differences were found in length of stay in intensive care or in the hospital.</s><s>The effects of thoracic epidural anesthesia (TEA) on total body oxygen supply-demand ratio are complex due to potential influences on both O2 delivery (QO2) and consumption (VO2). VO2 during recovery was greater in both the TEA and NLA groups than in the H group. Heart rate was slowest intraoperatively during TEA, and stroke work was less with TEA than with NLA. We conclude that in patients undergoing abdominal aortic surgery, TEA has no apparent advantage over general anesthesia.</s><s>The authors conducted a randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate the effect of epidural anesthesia and postoperative analgesia (EAA) on postoperative morbidity in a group of high-risk surgical patients. A total of 53 patients were admitted to the study, 28 received EAA, and 25 received standard anesthetic and analgesic techniques without EAA. Urinary cortisol excretion, a marker of the stress response, was significantly diminished during the first 24 postoperative hours in the group receiving EAA (P = 0.025). Finally, hospital costs were significantly reduced for patients who received EAA (P = 0.02).</s><s>Cardiovascular and hormonal responses to reconstructive abdominal aortic surgery were studied in 20 patients anaesthetized either with moderate-dose fentanyl (20 micrograms kg-1) combined with isoflurane, nitrous oxide and oxygen (n = 10), or with thoracolumbar epidural bupivacaine combined with isoflurane, nitrous oxide and oxygen (n = 10). After the start of operation, hypotension occurred in four patients in the epidural group. In both groups, the aortic cross-clamping caused slight increases both in mean arterial pressure and in calculated systemic vascular resistance, and a significant decrease in cardiac index. At the same time, a marked increase in plasma vasopressin was seen in the fentanyl group. The results suggest that thoracolumbar epidural bupivacaine combined with low-dose isoflurane in nitrous-oxide-oxygen prevents intra-operative hypertension and tachycardia, but it may cause hypotension.</s><s>To assess the role of postoperative analgesia on myocardial ischemia after aortic surgery, we compared intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA). In the TEA group, a T6-7 or T7-8 epidural catheter was inserted before the induction of general anesthesia. The overall incidence of myocardial ischemia was 18.4%-18.2% for TEA and 18.6% for PCA (P = not significant). Twenty-three patients had an adverse cardiac outcome, although there were no differences between the groups. In these patients undergoing elective aortic surgery, the use of postoperative TEA did not result in a lower incidence of early myocardial ischemia compared with intravenous PCA with morphine, despite better analgesia with TEA. Implications: Postoperative myocardial ischemia is associated with adverse cardiac outcome.</s><s>We assessed the efficacy and side effects of postoperative analgesia with three different pain regimens in 90 patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. Patients in all groups received IV sufentanil as part of their anesthetic management. We conclude that epidural analgesia provided better pain relief than IM analgesia, even if the latter was optimized by fixed-dose administration at fixed intervals and included adjustments on demand. Postoperative analgesia with epidural sufentanil or morphine and bupivacaine after major abdominal surgery seemed to be better than the conventional method of IM morphine treatment, despite optimal administration, i.e., fixed doses at fixed intervals with regular adjustments. Analgesic efficacy and side effects of epidural sufentanil and morphine were similar.</s><s>It has long been held that the acute-phase and neuroendocrine response to stress requires afferent neural input for its propagation. Total operative time (4.2 +/- 0.3 vs 4.3 +/- 0.4 hours), 72-hour fluid requirement (7.0 +/- 0.6 vs 6.8 +/- 0.71 mL), and length of hospitalization (7.8 +/- 1.4 vs 8.1 +/- 1.2 days) were not different between groups. All patients showed a significant increase in cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, total catecholamines, CRP, and IL-6 in the postoperative period (P < 0.05). IL-1beta and TNF-alpha were less predictable and undetectable in most patients. There was no difference in any of the stress response indices between those patients receiving patient-controlled or epidural catheter anesthesia.</s>"

        "Abstracts": "<s>The possible therapeutic effect of topical crude undiluted honey in the treatment of severe acute postoperative wound infections was studied. Fifty patients having postoperative wound infections following caesarean sections or total abdominal hysterectomies with gram positive or gram negative bacterial infections were allocated in two groups. Both groups received systemic antibiotics according to culture and sensitivity. Period for antibiotics use was 6.88 +/- 1.7 days in-group A and 15.45 +/- 4. After using honey, 22/26 patients (84.4%) showed complete wound healing without wound disruption or need for re-suturing and only 4 patients showed mild dehiscence.</s><s>Comparison of desloughing efficacy after four weeks and healing outcomes after 12 weeks in sloughy venous leg ulcers treated with Manuka honey (Woundcare 18+) vs. standard hydrogel therapy (IntraSite Gel). Expert opinion suggests that Manuka honey is effective as a desloughing agent but clinical evidence in the form of a randomised controlled trial is not available. Treatment was applied weekly for four weeks and follow-up was made at week 12. At week 4, mean % reduction in slough was 67% WoundCare 18+ vs. 52.9% IntraSite Gel (p = 0.054). Infection developed in 6 of the WoundCare 18+ group vs. 12 in the IntraSite Gel group. Additionally, effective desloughing significantly improves healing outcomes.</s><s>A prospective randomized clinical study to compare honey-impregnated gauze with amniotic membrane dressing in partial thickness burns was carried out. Forty of them were treated with honey-impregnated gauze and 24 were treated with amniotic membrane. Residual scars were noted in 8 per cent of patients treated with honey-impregnated gauze and in 16.6 per cent of cases treated with amniotic membrane (P < 0.001).</s><s>To compare honey and IntraSite Gel as woundhealing agents, to record side-effects, gauge patient satisfaction and calculate the cost-effectiveness of the honey used. A prospective, randomised, double-blind controlled trial was carried out among goldmine workers. Outcome measures were healing times of shallow wounds and abrasions; side-effects; patient satisfaction with treatment; and amount of honey and IntraSite Gel used. When adjusted for wound size, the difference of 0.22 days in favour of IntraSite Gel was not significant (p = 0.94, 95% CI: -5.72; 6.15.4). All patients in both treatment groups were either satisfied or extremely satisfied with treatment. The average cost of treatment per patient was R0.49 with honey and R12.03 with with IntraSite Gel.</s><s>The efficacy of honey as a treatment for venous ulcers has not been evaluated, despite widespread interest. At 12 weeks, 104 ulcers (55.6 per cent) in the honey-treated group and 90 (49.7 per cent) in the usual care group had healed (absolute increase 5.9 (95 per cent confidence interval (c.i.)

Honey-impregnated dressings did not significantly improve venous ulcer healing at 12 weeks compared with usual care.</s><s>This paper is a report of a study to compare a medical grade honey with conventional treatments on the healing rates of wounds healing by secondary intention. There is an increasing body of evidence to support the use of honey to treat wounds, but there is a lack of robust randomized trials on which clinicians can base their clinical judgement. The median time to healing in the honey group was 100 days compared with 140 days in the control group. The healing rate at 12 weeks was equal to 46.2% in the honey group compared with 34.0% in the conventional group, and the difference in the healing rates (95% confidence interval, CI) at 12 weeks between the two groups was 12.2% (-13.6%, 37.9%). Wound area at start of treatment and sex are both highly statistically significant predictors of time to healing.</s><s>Honey dressing was compared with boiled potato peel dressings as a cover for fresh partial-thickness burns in two groups of 50 randomly allocated patients. In the 50 patients treated with boiled potato peel dressings, persistent infection was noted within 7 days. Of the wounds treated with honey, 100 per cent healed within 15 days as against 50 per cent in the wounds treated with boiled potato peel dressings (mean 10.4 vs. 16.2 days).</s><s>Although many treatments have been suggested for this disease, there hasn't been an effective and safe treatment yet. Regarding the healing effect of honey in the chronic ulcers and its reported therapeutic effect in cutaneous leishmaniasis, we performed a study to better evaluate the efficacy of honey in cutaneous leishmaniasis and its final scar. Group A were treated with topical honey twice daily along with intralesional injection of glucantime once weekly until complete healing of the ulcer or for maximum of 6 weeks. The collected data were analyzed statistically using statistical tests including Chi-square, Mann Whitney and Kaplan-Mayer tests. Further studies to better clarify the efficacy of honey in cutaneous leishmaniasis is needed.</s><s>Anecdotal reports suggest that certain honey dressings have a positive effect on wound healing. Participants (n=100) were randomly assigned to receive either an active manuka honey dressing (n=52) or paraffin-impregnated tulle gras (n=48). Partial avulsion wounds healed statistically significantly faster (p=0.01) with paraffin tulle gras (19.62 days, SD 9.31) than with the honey dressing (31.76 days, SD 18.8), but no significant difference (p=0.21) was found following total avulsion when comparing honey (45.28 days, SD 18.03.) The results suggest that patients may benefit more from paraffin tulle gras dressings than honey dressings following partial toenail avulsion.</s><s>To compare the effect of honey dressing and silver-sulfadiazene (SSD) dressing on wound healing in burn patients. Patients (n=78) of both sexes, with age group between 10 and 50 years and with first and second degree of burn of less than 50% of TBSA (Total body surface area) were included in the study, over a period of 2 years (2006-08). After stabilization, patients were randomly attributed into two groups: 'honey group' and 'SSD group'. Status of the wound was assessed every third and seventh day and on the day of completion of study. The mean age for case (honey group) and control (SSD group) was 34.5 years and 28.5 years, respectively. Wound swab culture was positive in 29 out of 36 patients who came within 8 hours of burn and in all patients who came after 24 hours. Complete outcome for any admission point of time after 2 months was noted in 81% and 37% of patients in the honey group and the SSD group.</s><s>Honey dressing has been used to promote wound healing for years but scanty scientific studies did not provide enough evidences to justify it benefits in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. We conducted a prospective study to compare the effect of honey dressing for Wagner's grade-II diabetic foot ulcers with controlled dressing group (povidone iodine followed by normal saline). Surgical debridement and appropriate antibiotics were prescribed in all patients. In conclusion, ulcer healing was not significantly different in both study groups.</s><s>To investigate whether there is a difference between the efficacy of honey and sugar as wound dressings. Patients with open or infected wounds were randomised to receive either honey or sugar dressings. Forty patients were enrolled; 18 received sugar dressings and 22 honey dressings. In the honey group, 55% of patients had positive wound cultures at the start of treatment and 23% at one week, compared with 52% and 39% respectively in the sugar group.The median rate of healing in the first two weeks of treatment was 3.8cm2/week for the honey group and 2.2cm2/week for the sugar group.</s><s>In this prospective trial, 50 burn patients were randomised to be treated either with early tangential excision and skin grafting or by the application of honey dressings, with delayed skin grafting as necessary. The 25 patients in the tangential excision (TE) group had burns of 23 +/- 4%, 12% of which was full thickness. Seventeen of the TE patients were operated upon on day 3, the remainder before day 6 post burn. Only one TE patient died due to status asthmaticus, while there were 3 deaths, all from sepsis, in the HT patients. The availability of suitable allogenic blood is a potential problem when TE is employed.</s><s>Histological and clinical studies of wound healing have been made on comparable fresh partial thickness burns with honey dressing or silver sulfadiazine (SSD) in two groups of 25 randomly allocated patients. Of the wounds treated with honey 84 per cent showed satisfactory epithelialization by the 7th day, and in 100 per cent of the patients by the 21st day. Histological evidence of reparative activity was seen in 80 per cent of wounds treated with the honey dressing by the 7th day with minimal inflammation.</s><s>A total of 104 cases of superficial burn injury were studied to assess the efficiency of honey as a dressing in comparison with silver sulfadiazine gauze dressing. In the 52 patients treated with honey, 91 per cent of wounds were rendered sterile within 7 days. Healthy granulation tissue was observed earlier in patients treated with honey (mean 7.4 versus 13.4 days). Of the wounds treated with honey 87 per cent healed within 15 days as against 10 per cent in the control group.</s><s>Honey impregnated gauze was compared with OpSite as a cover for fresh partial thickness burns in 2 groups of 46 randomly allocated patients.</s>"

Sixty-four patients were chronically colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa; they received either amiloride or placebo as a nebulized solution three times daily for 6 months. Patients chronically colonized with Pseudomonas received nebulized colimycine twice a day for a month during the third and sixth months of treatment. For the patients not chronically colonized with Pseudomonas, the effect of the treatment was also evaluated by counting chronic colonizations with pathogens appearing during the trial period. Complementary analyses taking into account the gender, the type of mutation, the subpopulations whose FVC and FEV(1) were below 80% of normal values at the beginning of the study, and also patients less than 10 years old, did not show any statistically or clinically significant improvements following amiloride therapy.</s><s>To assess the benefit of nebulised amiloride added to the standard inpatient treatment of a respiratory exacerbation in cystic fibrosis. The time to reach peak FVC was significantly reduced in the amiloride group (4.2 v 7.6 days; 95% CI 0.4 to 6.4 days), but not in the time to reach peak FEV1 (5.7 v 7.9 days; 95% CI -1.2 to 5.6 days). Amiloride did not result in a greater overall improvement in respiratory function.</s><s>Aerosolized amiloride as treatment of cystic fibrosis lung disease: a pilot study.</s><s>In cystic fibrosis (CF) airway epithelial sodium absorption is increased 2-3 fold. Since sodium absorption is inhibited by the sodium channel blocker amiloride, our aim was to assess its therapeutic benefit in cystic fibrosis. Existing treatment was continued, and any infective exacerbations treated in the usual way. The frequency of infective exacerbations was also not different in either treatment period. We were thus unable to confirm the benefit shown in the only other clinical trial of nebulized amiloride in cystic fibrosis and conclude that, in the presence of established treatment for cystic fibrosis lung disease, nebulized amiloride offers no additional clinical benefit.</s><s>Abnormal homeostasis of the volume of airway surface liquid in patients with cystic fibrosis is thought to produce defects in mucus clearance and airway defense. Through osmotic forces, hypertonic saline may increase the volume of airway surface liquid, restore mucus clearance, and improve lung function. Mucus clearance and lung function were measured during 14-day baseline and treatment periods. Long-term inhalation of hypertonic saline without pretreatment with amiloride (i.e., with placebo pretreatment) resulted in a sustained (> or =8 hours) increase in 1-hour rates of mucus clearance, as compared with those with amiloride pretreatment (14.0+/-2.0 vs. 7.0+/-1.5 percent, respectively; P=0.02) and increased 24-hour rates of mucus clearance over baseline. In patients with cystic fibrosis, inhalation of hypertonic saline produced a sustained acceleration of mucus clearance and improved lung function. This treatment may protect the lung from insults that reduce mucus clearance and produce lung disease.</s>"

The purpose of this study was to determine whether diet and exercise interventions in those with IGT may delay the development of NIDDM, i.e., reduce the incidence of NIDDM, and thereby reduce the overall incidence of diabetic complications, such as cardiovascular, renal, and retinal disease, and the excess mortality attributable to these complications. In 1986, 110,660 men and women from 33 health care clinics in the city of Da Qing, China, were screened for IGT and NIDDM.

Over a 4-year period, we performed 82 PKTs with quadruple immunosuppression with OKT3 induction. The first 30 patients received standard intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG; 0.5 g/kg) for 6 doses and oral acyclovir for 3 months. All patients were monitored for viral infections in the first 6 months after PKT. The regimens of prophylaxis resulted in (1) no major non-CMV (including no EBV) viral infections; (2) 3 cases of minor non-CMV viral infections (shingles); and (3) no differences in the incidence, timing, or severity of symptomatic CMV infections in the 4 groups. For economic as well as efficacy reasons, we recommended that IVIG preparations not be used routinely with antilymphocyte therapy but only in high-risk situations such as primary CMV exposure.</s><s>We have previously shown that the preemptive use of cytomegalovirus (CMV) immunoglobulin (Ig) replacement (CytoGam) decreases the incidence of opportunistic infections in cardiac transplant recipients with severe hypogammaglobulinemia. However, the impact of Ig replacement in moderately hypogammaglobulinemic patients is unknown. Periodic monitoring of the IgG levels was done in 300 heart transplant recipients. Thirty-three patients declined randomization but agreed to have their IgG levels monitored. A significant reduction in CMV infection was noted in the CytoGam Group compared with the Placebo Group (15.4% [2/13] vs 60% [6/10], p = .039). Among patients who declined randomization, CMV infection developed in 13 (39.4%) of 33, and 6 (46.1%) of the 13 progressed to severe hypogammaglobulinemia.</s><s>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) remains the most important infection in the renal transplant recipient. Few data are available that provide guidance for approaches that seek to reduce the reactivation of latent disease after transplantation. Both groups received identical induction and rejection immunosuppressive therapy. The incidence of reactivation infections was half in patients receiving Nashville/rabbit antithymocyte serum (N/R-ATS) compared with those receiving monoclonal anti-CD-3 therapy.

This study was undertaken in order to see if high-risk renal transplant patients at risk for secondary CMV infection would benefit from prophylactic intravenous immunoglobulin infusions. Thirty-four patients were studied, 16 receiving the intravenous immunoglobulin infusions and 18 being untreated controls. This study suggests that prophylactic immunoglobulin infusions will reduce the severity of CMV infection in the patient who is at risk for secondary or reactivation infection as well as the patient at risk for primary infection.

Though the clinical manifestation of the disease is lowered by HIS in cyclosporin-treated patients, there is a higher infection incidence with increased severity in HIS-treated ATG/Imurek patients compared to the respective control.</s><s>A randomized placebo-controlled trial was conducted to determine the benefit of ganciclovir (5 mg/[kg x d]) for 30 days in addition to intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) for 16 weeks for prevention of primary cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease in children receiving liver transplants. The two groups of patients (recipients of 29 ganciclovir plus IVIG and 27 recipients of IVIG alone) were similar in terms of age, sex, and underlying disease. There was no difference between groups in terms of survival; episodes of rejection, bacteremia, or fungemia; use of immunosuppressive agents; and incidence of leukopenia or thrombocytopenia. Since short-term prophylaxis with ganciclovir may delay the onset of CMV disease, further studies with a longer course of ganciclovir prophylaxis are warranted.</s><s>Since infections with Herpetoviridae after kidney transplantation still remain a major clinical problem, we conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial using low-dose recombinant interferon-alpha-2C (rIFNa2C) prophylaxis in 50 renal graft recipients immunosuppressed with cyclosporine and methylprednisolone. Ten patients were excluded from further analysis because of graft loss due to surgical complications, side effects of rIFNa2C, and because of lack of compliance. We conclude, that low-dose rIFNa2C prophylaxis is harmful in renal allograft recipients treated with cyclosporine in view of the high incidence of irreversible transplant rejections without beneficial effects on the occurrence of viral infections.</s><s>A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of interferon prophylaxis against viral infections was conducted in renal-transplant recipients receiving standard immunosuprressive therapy with or without antithymocyte globulin. Interferon was administered for six weeks, beginning on the day of transplantation. Patient and graft survival were comparable in interferon and placebo groups. There preliminary results suggest that a six-week course of prophylactic interferon delays shedding of cytomegalovirus and decreases the incidence of viremia after transplantation.</s><s>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection remains a serious problem after lung transplantation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of CytoGam, a CMV hyperimmune globulin (CMV-IGIV), as CMV prophylaxis after lung transplantation. Cytomegalovirus viremia was detected in 13 of 22 recipients without prophylaxis and in 16 of 22 recipients with CMV-IGIV prophylaxis (p = 0.19).

Interferon (3 x 10(6) units was given thrice weekly for the first 6 weeks, then twice weekly for a further 8 weeks. During the period of interferon therapy, the incidence of CMV excretion was lower in the interferon group (28% versus 50%, P = 0.065), mainly due to a significant reduction of CMV reactivation (9% versus 56%, P = 0.02). Of the patients in the treatment group who excreted CMV, 43% developed disease as compared to 63% in the control group (difference not significant). Benefit appears to be restricted to seropositive recipients of seronegative kidneys. The interferon regime used in this study was well tolerated, with mild fever being the only reported side-effect. The incidence of rejection and graft loss was not different between the two groups.</s><s>In a double-blind placebo-controlled study, the value of prophylactic anti-CMV immunoglobulin administration was evaluated in 39 kidney transplant recipients treated for rejection with rabbit antithymocyte globulin.

A total of 266 patients (ACV, n = 133; GCV+HIg, n = 133) completed the protocol and were available for follow-up. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that receiving antirejection therapy, a liver transplant, or a donor organ from a CMV-seropositive individual if the recipient was CMV seronegative were major risk factors for the development of CMV disease (P < 0.001), while the difference between ACV versus GCV + HIg prophylaxis was also significant (P = 0.054). No differences in actuarial patient or allograft survival, however, were noted between the 2 prophylaxis groups.

The immune globulin was administered in multiple doses over the first four months after transplantation. The incidence of virologically confirmed CMV-associated syndromes was reduced from 60 percent in controls to 21 percent in recipients of CMV immune globulin (P less than 0.01). Only 4 percent of globulin recipients had marked leukopenia (reflecting serious CMV disease), as compared with 37 percent of the controls (P less than 0.01).

After surgery, doses were given three times a week for six weeks and then twice a week for eight weeks (total of 102 X 10(6) units).

We conclude that these vision changes can be attributed to the short-term occlusion experienced by all subjects during treatment and that grating stimulation did not contribute to this improvement.</s><s>To evaluate the effectiveness of treatment of amblyopia in children aged 7 to 17 years. In the 13- to 17-year-olds (n = 103), the responder rates were 25% and 23%, respectively, overall (adjusted P = .22) but 47% and 20%, respectively, among patients not previously treated with patching and/or atropine for amblyopia (adjusted P = .03). Most patients, including responders, were left with a residual visual acuity deficit. For patients 13 to 17 years, prescribing patching 2 to 6 hours per day with near visual activities may improve visual acuity when amblyopia has not been previously treated but appears to be of little benefit if amblyopia was previously treated with patching. We do not yet know whether visual acuity improvement will be sustained once treatment is discontinued; therefore, conclusions regarding the long-term benefit of treatment and the development of treatment recommendations for amblyopia in children 7 years and older await the results of a follow-up study we are conducting on the patients who responded to treatment.</s><s>To compare the effects of perceptual learning or patching on improving visual acuity and contrast sensitivity in patients with anisometropic amblyopia. Patients with anisometropic amblyopia received either patching or perceptual learning treatment. Corrected amblyopic logMAR visual acuity and contrast sensitivity function were measured at four-weekly intervals until visual acuity stabilized or amblyopia resolved. Resolution of amblyopia was achieved in 10 of 26 patients (38%) in the perceptual learning group and 17 of 27 patients (63%) in the patching group (p=0.809). Visual acuity can be improved with perceptual learning and patching in older children and adult patients with anisometropic amblyopia.</s><s>To compare visual outcome in response to two prescribed rates of occlusion (six hours a day and 12 hours a day). 97 children with a confirmed diagnosis of amblyopia associated with strabismus, anisometropia, or both. Visual acuity measured by logMAR letter recognition; objectively monitored rate of occlusion (hours a day). The mean change in visual acuity of the amblyopic eye was not significantly different (P=0.64) between the two groups (0.26 (95% confidence interval 0.21 to 0.31) log units in six hour group; 0.24 (0.19 to 0.29) log units in 12 hour group). Children aged under 4 required significantly less occlusion than older children.</s><s>To compare 2 hours of daily patching (combined with 1 hour of concurrent near visual activities) with a control group of spectacle wear alone (if needed) for treatment of moderate to severe amblyopia in children 3 to 7 years old. Randomization either to 2 hours of daily patching with 1 hour of near visual activities or to spectacles alone (if needed). Patients were continued on the randomized treatment (or no treatment) until no further improvement was noted.</s><s>To determine whether performing near activities while patching for amblyopia enhances improvement in visual acuity. A total of 425 children, aged 3 to <7 years, with amblyopia (20/40-20/400) that was caused by anisometropia, strabismus, or both, and that persisted after treatment with spectacles. Children were randomized to 2 hours of patching per day with near activities or 2 hours of patching per day with distance activities. Instruction sheets describing common near and distance activities were given to the parents. In weeks without a visit, weekly telephone calls were made to the parent to monitor and encourage compliance during the first 8 weeks. Masked assessment of visual acuity by isolated crowded HOTV optotypes at 8 weeks.</s><s>To compare spectacle correction alone with spectacle correction with Bangerter filters to treat anisometropic amblyopia in children. Optimal refractive correction was provided, and the children were assigned to treatment with either spectacles or spectacles in combination with a Bangerter filter worn on the spectacle lens of the better eye. The difference in the mean time to the resolution of amblyopia was 3.9+/-3.2 months for the spectacles group versus 2.2+/-1.9 months for the filter group, and the difference reached significance (P<0.05). After 1 year, there was no significant difference in the BCVA between the groups. The binocular function improved in both groups; at 1 year there was no significant difference between the groups. The median spherical equivalent refractive error increased significantly during the study in the amblyopic eyes (P<0.05) and the fellow eyes (P<0.001).</s>"

Clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine (but not haloperidol) resulted in statistically significant improvements in total score on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. The effects of atypical antipsychotics in this population were statistically significant but clinically modest.</s><s>Atypical antipsychotics are commonly used in the management of schizophrenia in late life with evidence suggesting they induce lower rates of motor disturbance, but have similar efficacy to conventional antipsychotics. Trials in the elderly have been either retrospective, small, of short duration or of a single-arm design. Elderly patients with schizophrenia were randomly allocated to olanzapine or risperidone and followed through an open-label crossover period. The mean doses upon completion of switching in each arm were 9.9 mg (SD = 4.2) and 1.7 mg (SD = 1.2) for olanzapine and risperidone respectively. Patients in the olanzapine arm also demonstrated improvement from baseline in the WHO-QOL-BREF physical, psychological and health satisfaction domains, but risperidone had no effect on any Quality of Life (QOL) measure. Subjects switched to olanzapine were more likely to complete the switching process and show an improvement in psychological QOL.</s><s>The safety and efficacy of risperidone and olanzapine were compared in a double-blind trial that used doses widely accepted in clinical practice. Similar proportions of the risperidone and olanzapine groups reported extrapyramidal symptoms (24% and 20%, respectively). Severity of extrapyramidal symptoms was low in both groups, with no between-group differences. Comparison of individual factors found no significant differences at endpoint; at week 8, however, improvements on Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale factors for positive symptoms and anxiety/depression were greater with risperidone than olanzapine. An increase in body weight of > or =7% was seen in 27% of olanzapine participants and 12% of risperidone participants.

In an 8-week, international, double-blind study, patients (outpatients, hospital inpatients, and residents of nursing or boarding homes) were randomly assigned to receive risperidone (1 mg to 3 mg/day) or olanzapine (5 mg to 20 mg/day). Subjects were 175 patients age 60 years or over with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Total scores on the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale were reduced in both groups at endpoint; between-treatment differences were not significant.

We conducted a prospective study of consecutively hospitalized young patients (mean age = 22.4 years) with DSM-IV schizophrenia or related disorders (N = 113) who were treated with olanzapine or risperidone. Patients who had started olanzapine (N = 39) or risperidone treatment (N = 23) prior to admission continued with that medication if they showed initial clinical response. The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) was administered at admission and 6 weeks thereafter. The 35 subjects treated with olanzapine at both assessments had significantly (p = .01) more severe OCS at week 6 than the 20 subjects treated with risperidone at both assessments. There are no differences in the short-term propensity of olanzapine or risperidone to induce or exacerbate OCS.

Data on comparative studies of these drugs for improving claudication in the elderly are limited. Patients sixty-five years or older with claudication were randomly assigned to receive aspirin or pentoxifylline. Both the aspirin and the pentoxifylline groups reported a moderate level of pain (2/5) and remained about the same (2/5 for aspirin and 1/5 for pentoxifylline, P = 0.9, NS) after six weeks. However, the pentoxifylline group reported a farther walking distance of 2 miles compared with the aspirin group of 1.2 miles (P < 0.05).</s><s>Thirty-one patients, mean age 60 years (range 45-80 years), with a typical history and objective symptoms of intermittent claudication with a reported maximal walking distance less than 500 m, were included in a cross-over study. The median of the maximal walking distance was 255 m after the placebo period, increasing significantly (p less than 0.01) during both medication periods: by 43% and 18% during flunarizine and pentoxifylline, respectively. No changes were recorded in the ankle systolic blood pressure ratio ( ASBP -ratio) after placebo or either medication period. We conclude that the decrease in red cell rigidity may have contributed to the increased walking distance.</s><s>The aim of this study was to test whether in claudicants oral pentoxifylline, given for twelve weeks in addition to physical exercise, prolongs the walking distance more than placebo plus exercise. Forty outpatients were randomized into group A (2 x 600 mg oral pentoxifylline per day) or group B (placebo). After one and eight weeks, but not after twelve weeks, the maximal walking distances were significantly longer in group A than in group B. The data suggest that pentoxifylline is clinically effective in claudicants even when given in addition to exercise. The benefit of drug plus physical therapy compared with exercise alone could be observed mainly in the first weeks of treatment and may wear off during long-term therapy.</s><s>The influence of the xanthine derivative pentoxifylline ('Trental' or BL191; Hoechst-Roussel) on exercise tolerance was measured in 38 subjects with stable, severe to moderately severe, intermittent claudication who completed a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, cross-over clinical trial. This was shown by a 'therapeutic effect ratio' of 0.98 for treadmill claudication distance and 0.96 for treadmill walking distance after within-patient analysis at the end of the cross-over (where a ratio of 1.0 means the test drug and placebo effects are identical). These ratios have 95% confidence limits of 0.72-1.34 and 0.74-1.25, respectively.</s><s>Pentoxifylline (Trental 400 mg coated tablets) and nylidrin HCl 3 mg were compared for clinical efficacy and safety in an 8-week randomized double-blind trial.

The clear improvement shown for both variables was greater and statistically significant (p less than or equal to 0.05) after treatment with pentoxifylline.

Mean maximal walking distance of cilostazol-treated patients (n = 227) was significantly greater at every postbaseline visit compared with patients who received pentoxifylline (n = 232) or placebo (n = 239). After 24 weeks of treatment, mean maximal walking distance increased by a mean of 107 m (a mean percent increase of 54% from baseline) in the cilostazol group, significantly more than the 64-m improvement (a 30% mean percent increase) with pentoxifylline (P <0.001).</s><s>A double-blind, parallel group, multicenter clinical trial of pentoxifylline compared with placebo enrolled 150 patients with moderately severe chronic occlusive arterial disease (COAD) at three centers in Scandinavia. The diagnosis of COAD was established by clinical findings, conventional angiography, and noninvasive peripheral Doppler pressure assessment at rest and after exercise. By using two clinically relevant parameters, which are a resting ankle/arm pressure ratio 0.8 or less and a duration of COAD for greater than 1 year, a target population could be defined in whom trial results became highly significant.</s><s>In the light of the current controversy surrounding the use of hemorheologic and vasodilator drugs in the treatment of peripheral arteriosclerosis, a comparative study was designed in order to evaluate the efficacy of pentoxifylline, buflomedil, and nifedipine in 45 patients with peripheral arterial disease (Fontaine stage II). The patients in this prospective randomized study were divided into three groups: 15 patients received pentoxifylline treatment (1,200 mg/day), 15 were treated with buflomedil (600 mg/day), and 15 with nifedipine (60 mg/day). Significant differences within groups were also noted for initial claudication, toe peak-flow time, pulse reappearance time (PRT/2), and maximum postischemic flow time, together with significant intergroup variables. In conclusion, pentoxifylline proved more effective than the other drugs tested in: 1. improving distal pressure and resting microcirculatory blood flow; 2. increasing postexercise distal flow, ratios, and pressures and enabling faster recuperation of basal pulse rates; 3. increasing initial claudication distance in the strain test within the test group and achieving a greater absolute subjective claudication distance than that obtained using the other treatments.</s><s>The efficacy, safety and cost of pentoxifylline (PXF) in severe intermittent claudication was studied comparing PXF and placebo in a 12-month study. A treadmill test and microcirculatory evaluation with laser Doppler flowmetry were performed at inclusion and at the end of 6 and 12 months. A physical training plan (based on walking) and reduction in risk factor levels plan was used in both groups. The two groups were comparable for age, sex distribution, walking distance, and the presence of risk factors and smoking. Microcirculatory evaluation indicated an increase in flux (p < 0.05) in the PXF group (not significant in the placebo group); the after-exercise flux (AEF) was increased (p<0.05) in both groups at 6 months but the increase in AEF was greater in the PXF group at 12 month.</s><s>Prostanoids, which promote vasodilation and reduce platelet aggregation, have been proposed as candidate therapies for intermittent claudication due to peripheral arterial disease (PAD). This study tested the hypothesis that iloprost, an oral prostacyclin analogue, would improve walking distance and quality of life in patients with intermittent claudication. The study was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing three doses of oral iloprost (50 microg, 100 microg, or 150 microg twice daily), pentoxifylline, or placebo in 430 patients with intermittent claudication. The primary outcome measure was improvement in absolute claudication distance (ACD) after 6 months.</s><s>A double blind placebo-controlled randomised crossover study was performed with Pentoxifylline (Trental 400 tablets with 400 mg active ingredient) in 24 patients (19 males, 5 females, aged between 40 and 71 years) suffering from peripheral occlusive arteriopathy of stage II severity (Fontaine's classification). The dosage was 3 tablets of either formulation t.d.s., the treatment periods were 8 weeks each with a two week washout between. There was a significant 60% increase in pain-free walking distance in either Pentoxifylline treatment periods, whereas there were no clinically relevant changes in the placebo periods. When comparing the two starting periods only, there was an increase in the Pentoxifylline group from 223 to 359 m on average and in the placebo group from 208 to 215 m, patients in both groups being comparable at basal level as to the distribution of sex, age, location of occlusion, duration of disease as well as in respect to the walking capacity.</s><s>Cilostazol is a new phosphodiesterase inhibitor with anti-platelet and vasodilatory properties.

Patients given either cilostazol or pentoxifylline showed a significant improvements in maximal walking distance compared with the placebo group (34 m and 33 m respectively, compared with 5 m; both P<0.05). Neither cilostazol nor pentoxifylline increased the ankle-brachial index after treatment. In contrast, VEGF levels remained stable after the administration of pentoxifylline. Thus the mechanisms involved in the pentoxifylline-treated group were different from those in the cilostazol-treated group, and require further study.</s><s>Twenty-six patients with severe short-distance claudication underwent a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group evaluation of the efficacy of pentoxifylline in the treatment of intermittent claudication. A statistically significant improvement in both parameters was present in the pentoxifylline-treated patients.</s><s>The efficacy, safety, and tolerance of pentoxifylline (Trental, Hoechst-Roussel Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) in the treatment of intermittent claudication associated with chronic occlusive arterial disease (COAD) were evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter clinical trial involving a total of 128 outpatients. Pentoxifylline given orally in doses up to 1200 mg/day was significantly more effective than placebo in increasing both the initial and absolute claudication distances in patients with COAD. Reduction of lower limb paresthesias also suggested greater clinical improvement in the pentoxifylline treated patients. These results support the hypothesis that pentoxifylline reduces blood viscosity by improving red cell flexibility, and thereby enhances blood flow in patients with COAD.</s><s>The efficacy, safety, and cost of pentoxifylline (PXF) in long-range (>400 m interval) intermittent claudication was studied comparing PXF and placebo in a 12-month study. A training plan based on walking was associated with the control of risk factor levels. There was a 38% difference at 6 months and 39% at 12 months in favor of PXF. In conclusion, PXF improved walking distance significantly better than placebo.</s>"

Three doses were administered before surgery into the superior and inferior cul-de-sac at 10 minutes, 5 minutes, and immediately before the initial corneal incision. Patients in group 1 received a 0.5-ml injection of balanced salt solution, and those in group 2 received a 0.5-ml injection of 1% lidocaine. A 10-point visual analogue scale was used immediately after the surgery to assess each patient's overall severity of pain intraoperatively. Ninety percent of patients in group 1 and 95% in group 2 assigned a score of 0 or 1 to the level of intraoperative discomfort. The difference between the pain scores for the two groups was statistically significant (P = 0.0053). A small but significant proportion (15%) of patients in group 1 expressed distress when the ciliary body was stretched or the iris was manipulated with instruments. Although topical lidocaine alone provides adequate anesthesia for phacoemulsification and implantation of a foldable IOL, combined topical and intracameral administration of lidocaine can further minimize intraoperative discomfort.</s><s>To determine the safety and efficacy of intracameral injections of unpreserved lidocaine to reduce intraocular sensation.

Both men and women between 45 and 85 years of age who were scheduled for elective cataract surgery while under topical anesthesia participated. Patients were randomized to receive either topical anesthesia plus intracameral 1% preservative-free lidocaine or intracameral balanced salt solution. Patients also recorded the degree to which they were bothered by tissue manipulation and the microscope light. There was no significant difference in patient-reported pain scores for delivery of anesthesia (P = 0.902), surgery (P = 0.170), or after surgery (P = 0.680). Patients in the lidocaine group reported being less bothered by tissue manipulation (P = 0.021). Injection of intraocular lidocaine increases patient cooperation and decreases the degree to which patients are bothered by tissue manipulation, two outcomes that justify its use.</s><s>To compare topical tetracaine 0.5% alone and with intracameral lidocaine 1% as a local anesthetic agent in phacoemulsification with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. The patients' subjective experience of pain was measured at 4 points during surgery using a 4-point pain scale. Central endothelial cell counts were obtained preoperatively and 1 month postoperatively. The mean pain score at the end of surgery was also significantly higher in the intracameral BSS group than in the intracameral lidocaine group (0.60 +/- 0.6 and 0.21 +/- 0.4, respectively; P < .014). Endothelial cell loss 1 month postoperatively was similar between the 2 groups (6.1% +/- 8% and 6.7% +/- 6%). Topical tetracaine 0.5% with intracameral lidocaine was safe and effective in patients having phacoemulsification with IOL implantation. The advantage of using intracameral lidocaine 1% over a placebo was a significant decrease in the patients' subjective experience of pain and in the surgeon's satisfaction with the anesthesia used.

Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the independent association between outcome and predictor variables. One hundred ten patients were recruited; 60 received control shunt systems and 50 received AIS systems. Thirteen shunt infections were recorded (10 in the control group and three in the AIS group). Nine (69%) of 13 infections occurred within 2 months after shunt implantation (eight of 10 in the control group and one of three in the AIS group). Staphylococcus species accounted for the majority of shunt infections (83%): all 10 control shunts were found to have a positive culture of staphylococci, whereas none of the AISs had any staphylococci (p = 0.038). The AIS system represents another important tool to enable the neurosurgeon to prevent shunt infections.</s><s>Catheter-related infection of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pathways is a potentially life-threatening complication of external ventricular drainage.

Patients (N=42) with chronic vestibular dysfunction were divided into either a rehabilitation group (group 1) or a control group (group 2). Significant improvements in all parameters (VAS, DHI, BBS, mCTSIB) were observed in group 1 (P<.05). Significant improvements were seen in symptom, disability, balance, and postural stability in chronic unilateral vestibular dysfunction after an exercise program. Customized exercise programs are beneficial in treatment of chronic unilateral vestibular dysfunction.</s><s>We performed a prospective study to evaluate the efficacy of three physical treatments for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo: Brandt & Daroff habituation exercises, the Semont manoevre (intended as a statoconia-detachment maneuver), and the Epley maneuver (intended as a statoconia-repositioning maneuver). A total of 106 BPPV patients were randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups, and responses were evaluated one week, one month and three months after the initial treatment. At the one-week follow-up, similar cure rates were obtained with the Semont and Epley maneuver (74% and 71% respectively), both cure rates being significantly higher than that obtained with Brandt & Daroff exercises (24%). By the three-month follow-up, the cure rate obtained with the Epley maneuver was higher (93%) than that obtained with the Semont maneuver (77%), though both remained higher than that obtained with the Brandt & Daroff maneuver (62%).</s><s>To investigate the effect of an additional vestibular stimulated exercise programme on balance for patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Twenty-six subjects with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo involving the unilateral posterior semicircular canal. Static balance tests, tandem walk test, Dynamic Gait Index and subjective rating of the intensity of vertigo were measured at baseline, two-week and four-week assessments. Compared with the control group, subjects in the experimental group demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in single leg stance with eyes closed at the two-week assessment (P<0.05). The present study demonstrated that additional exercise training, which emphasizes vestibular stimulation, can improve balance ability and functional gait performance among patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo who had already undergone the canalith repositioning manoeuvre.</s><s>'Vestibular rehabilitation' (VR) is an increasingly popular treatment option for patients with persistent dizziness. Previous clinical trials have only evaluated the effects of specialist therapy programmes in small, selective, or uncontrolled patient samples. Adults consulting their general practitioner (GP) with dizziness or vertigo were randomly assigned to treatment or control groups. The treatment group (n = 67) improved on all measures, whereas the control group (n = 76) showed no improvement, resulting in a significant difference between the two groups on physical indices of balance and subjective indices of symptoms and distress. VR is a simple, inexpensive, and beneficial treatment, and may be an appropriate first stage of management for many dizzy patients in primary care.</s><s>Vestibular rehabilitation is a specific approach to physical therapy aimed at reducing dizziness and imbalance by facilitating central nervous system compensation for peripheral vestibular dysfunction. This study takes the first step toward determining the efficacy of a specific exercise approach for reducing dizziness and imbalance in patients with chronic peripheral vestibular disorders.</s><s>Benign paraoxysmal postural vertigo (BPPV) is one of the most frequent causes of peripheral dizziness. The only therapeutic maneuvers (based on otolyte release) are equally effective but present a high medium term recurrence. The results were compared in regard to the signs and symptoms observed in the three groups of patients at 15 days, one month and at three months of treatment. The SM was effective in 80% of the patients at 15 days of treatment versus 45% of those receiving only VRE.

In addition, the older vestibular rehabilitation group had better balance scores at 12 weeks when compared with their original preoperative scores (P<0.05). In patients over 50, early vestibular rehabilitation facilitates recovery of postural control after acoustic neuroma surgery.</s><s>This study investigated the relative effects of vestibular rehabilitation (VR) and social reinforcement (SR) on recovery following ablative vestibular surgery. A multiple comparison of the overall outcome measures showed no significant differences in group performance over an 8-week period. When individual outcome measures were compared, MSQ and DHI results at the end of the 8-week treatment period revealed less motion sensitivity and dizziness handicap in groups who received VR, with or without SR, as compared with the group who received ROM exercises. These results suggest that after a vestibular injury most patients can effectively utilize central compensation mechanisms to recover from such an injury, regardless of the type of therapeutic intervention used. This investigation is continuing as a long-term follow-up study to determine whether there are any long-term benefits in participating in a VR program.</s><s>To determine which common, nonpharmacological, nonsurgical treatments are most effective for treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). No vestibular-suppressant medication or special instructions for head positioning were used. Post-tests were given at 1 week after treatment and at approximately 3 months and 6 months later. Multilevel analyses showed that vertigo decreased significantly after LM, CRP, and Brandt-Daroff exercise; those three groups did not differ significantly. These results support two possible mechanisms of BPPV: displaced otoconia and a neural mechanism affecting interpretation of semicircular canal signals.</s><s>To evaluate the effect of vestibular rehabilitation exercises in the early stages of peripheral vestibular disorders. Patients were evaluated by visual analogue scale, physical examination, and need to use the medication. Study group patients recovered faster than controls and used less medication. By 10 to 14 days after the intervention, 43% of study group and 5% of control group patients had no significant symptoms (P < .001), and 67% of study group and 3% of control group patients needed no medication (P < .001).</s><s>In order to determine which variables influence recovery from acoustic neuroma resection, acutely postoperative patients were divided into two groups and treated twice daily at bedside as inpatients at a tertiary care center. Post-tests were given at discharge and at approximately 4-week intervals for 3 months. VOR on the unoperated side returned to normal values but on the lesioned side did not. Therefore, compensation is influenced by tumor size but not by age or early postoperative vestibular rehabilitation.</s><s>To determine the effect of vestibular exercises on the recovery of visual acuity during head movement in patients with unilateral vestibular hypofunction. As a group, patients who performed vestibular exercises showed a significant improvement in DVA-predictable (P<.001) and DVA-unpredictable (P<.001), while those performing placebo exercises did not (P =.07). This reached significance for DVA-predictable (P =.009) but not DVA-unpredictable (P =.11). Other factors examined included age, time from onset, initial DVA, oscillopsia, and duration of treatment. Exercises may foster the use of centrally programmed eye movements that could substitute for the vestibulo-ocular reflex. The DVA-predictable would benefit more from this than would DVA-unpredictable.</s><s>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of two exercise programs on balance performance in patients with chronic peripheral vestibular dysfunction and to assess whether these exercise programs induce adaptive modifications of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). (1) Those in the Rehab (Reh) group (n = 11) received a comprehensive exercise program that consisted of balance retraining and goal-directed eye-head exercises under combinations of varied visual and somatosensory sensory conditions. Patients received 45-minute training sessions, three times per week for 12 weeks, and were instructed on a custom home exercise program. In addition, after completion of the exercise program and a follow-up period, 7 of the participants in the Home group (here defined as the A group) chose to enter the Reh program (here defined as the B group). The VOR response to step chair rotations of 60 degrees/s and 120 degrees/s, and the optokinetic reflex (OKN) response to 60 degrees/s constant velocity optokinetic stimuli were recorded. These tests were performed 1 day prior to start of treatment (TD 1), 6 weeks after start of treatment (TD 2), at the end of the 12-week treatment period (TD 3), and 5 months after end of treatment (TD 4).</s><s>Although vestibular rehabilitation (VR) is gaining popularity, few data support its utility in improving locomotor stability, and no good predictors exist of whom will benefit most. A double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial of vestibular rehabilitation was conducted at a large tertiary care hospital on 124 patients (59 +/- 18 years old) with unilateral (n = 51) or bilateral (n = 73) vestibular hypofunction, of whom 86 completed a 12-week intervention.</s><s>Patients with chronic vestibular symptoms are common in neurological practice but the most effective treatment remains an open question. The purpose of our study was to conduct a controlled, between-group comparison of patients' responses to a customised exercise regime (Group C, for customised) versus treatment additionally incorporating simulator based desensitisation exposure (Group S, for simulator) integrating whole-body or visual environment rotators. Significant differences were noted between groups (p = 0.02) for posturography scores. Conclusions: Both groups improved but exposure to simulator motion gave overall better results. Visual motion and visuo-vestibular conflict situations should be incorporated in the rehabilitation of patients with refractory dizziness.</s><s>In 20 patients diagnosed with Menière's disease, transcutaneous nerve stimulation (TNS) and applied relaxation (AR) were used as a treatment aimed at reducing tinnitus and dizziness and increasing hearing ability. The vestibular tests did not reveal any significant changes either after TNS or AR intervention. Tinnitus matching showed changes of pitch and loudness before and after both TNS and AR intervention. However, no statistically significant changes between treatment regimes were found on these measures.</s><s>To assess the efficacy of rehabilitation for dizzy patients after recent acute vestibular disturbance. All patients performed static stabilometry (posturography), undertook the dynamic gait index test, and completed a dizziness handicap questionnaire and a visual analogue scale for anxiety, at baseline and on completion. The visual analogue scale anxiety score was statistically significantly more reduced in rehabilitated patients compared with control patients. Control patients maintained a higher visual dependence for postural control. These results would appear to support the effectiveness of a supervised exercise programme for patients following acute onset of vestibular disturbance. A correlation was found in both groups between dynamic gait index results and anxiety. In our experience, a rehabilitation programme seems to reduce dependence on visual cues for postural control.</s><s>Animal experiments have shown that central vestibular compensation of unilateral peripheral vestibular lesions can be improved by vestibular exercises. There are, however, no equivalent clinical studies on the efficacy of such specific physiotherapy on acute unilateral peripheral vestibular lesions in humans. Although normalization of OT and SVV was similar in the control and physiotherapy groups, the total SP values on day 30 after symptom onset differed significantly: 3.2 +/- 1.9 m/min in the physiotherapy group and 16.9 +/- 6.1 m/min in the control group (ANOVA, p < 0.001).</s><s>The use of exercises in the treatment of patients with vestibular deficits has become increasingly popular, and evidence exists that these exercises are beneficial in patients with chronic vestibular deficits. The question as to whether patients with acute unilateral vestibular loss would benefit from vestibular adaptation exercises is particularly compelling, however, because animal studies have demonstrated that the acute stage after unilateral vestibular loss is a critical period for recovery. Deprivation of visuomotor experience during that period can delay the onset of recovery as well as prolong the recovery period.</s>"

Biochemotherapy involved CVD with vinblastine reduced 25% plus interleukin-2 by 24-hour continuous infusion (on days 5 to 8, 17 to 20, and 26 to 29) and interferon alfa-2b by subcutaneous injection (on days 5 to 9, 17 to 21, and 26 to 30). Among 190 patients enrolled, 91 were assessable for biochemotherapy and 92 for chemotherapy. Ten percent of the patients were alive a median of 52 months from start of therapy. Biochemotherapy produced substantially more constitutional, hemodynamic, and myelosuppressive toxic effects. Cytokines substantially augment the antitumor activity of chemotherapy at the expense of considerable toxicity in patients with metastatic melanoma.</s><s>Combined chemotherapy with or without interferon alpha N1 (IFN) for advanced malignant melanoma--a randomized pilot phase III study.</s><s>Interferon alpha-2a and dacarbazine in melanoma.</s><s>To investigate the response rate, time to treatment failure (TTF), overall survival, and toxicity in patients with metastatic melanoma treated with dacarbazine alone, dacarbazine plus interferon (IFN), dacarbazine plus tamoxifen (TMX), or dacarbazine plus IFN plus TMX. Two hundred seventy-one patients (258 were eligible) were randomized in a 2 x 2 factorial design to receive one of the above treatments. Five CRs and 20 PRs occurred in patients treated with TMX compared with eight CRs and 16 PRs in those treated without TMX. Poor performance status (PS), hepatic metastases, and weight loss were significant adverse prognostic factors. Twenty-three patients had a TTF greater than 20 months, and these durable responses were evenly distributed among the treatment arms. Significantly more severe and life-threatening toxic events occurred with treatments that contained IFN.</s><s>60 patients were entered into a randomised study comparing vindesine (3 mg/m2/week) plus interferon-alpha 2b (6 U/m2 3 times per week) to vindesine alone or to interferon alone for the treatment of metastatic malignant melanoma. Patients receiving the combination therapy arm (schedule A; vindesine plus interferon-alpha 2b) showed a complete and partial response rate of 8/20 (40%) which was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that achieved with either single-agent treatment schedule. It is concluded that combination treatment regimens utilising interferons together with chemotherapeutic agents deserve further study in the treatment of metastatic malignant melanoma.</s><s>Temozolomide is an imidazotetrazine with a mechanism of action similar to dacarbazine and equivalent activity in melanoma. It is well tolerated and is a candidate for combination chemotherapy and schedule manipulation. Response or disease stabilization occurred in 20% of patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 10% to 33%) given 8-hourly temozolomide, 21% (95% CI, 12% to 33%) given temozolomide/interferon, and 25% (95% CI, 15% to 38%) given temozolomide/thalidomide. Grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicities were similar in each arm except for infection, which was more frequent with 8-hourly temozolomide. Of the three regimens tested, the combination of temozolomide and thalidomide seems the most promising for future study.</s><s>To compare, in 305 patients with advanced metastatic melanoma, temozolomide and dacarbazine (DTIC) in terms of overall survival, progression-free survival (PFS), objective response, and safety, and to assess health-related quality of life (QOL) and pharmacokinetics of both drugs and their metabolite, 5-(3-methyltriazen-1-yl)imidazole-4-carboximide (MTIC). Patients were randomized to receive either oral temozolomide at a starting dosage of 200 mg/m(2)/d for 5 days every 28 days or intravenous (IV) DTIC at a starting dosage of 250 mg/m(2)/d for 5 days every 21 days. In the intent-to-treat population, median survival time was 7.7 months for patients treated with temozolomide and 6.4 months for those treated with DTIC (hazards ratio, 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92 to 1.52). Temozolomide was well tolerated and produced a noncumulative, transient myelosuppression late in the 28-day cycle. The most common nonhematologic toxicities were mild to moderate nausea and vomiting, which were easily managed.</s><s>Phase II and III studies have shown that the addition of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon alpha-2b (IFN alpha-2b) in multiagent chemotherapy (CT) for advanced melanoma increases overall response (OR), albeit without clear evidence of an improvement in overall survival (OS). Treatment with high-dose IL-2 can cause severe toxicity and is normally administered in an inpatient setting. In the 87 bioCT-arm patients, 22 ORs (25.3%) (three CRs and 19 PRs) (P =.70) were recorded. However, the 11-month median OS in the bioCT arm does not differ greatly from the best results with high-dose IL-2-containing regimens reported in the literature. Furthermore, our treatment schedule was carried out on outpatients and had an acceptable level of toxicity.</s><s>Sixty-four patients with histologically confirmed metastatic malignant melanoma were entered on a prospectively controlled randomized trial. Median time to treatment failure (TTF) and median survival are significantly better on the combination arm, with some long-term CRs observed. More toxicity was encountered in the combination arm, which was acceptable except in three patients where treatment was discontinued because of IFN toxicity.</s><s>The combination of chemotherapy with immunotherapeutic agents such as interleukin-2 and interferon alfa-2b has been reported to provide improved treatment results in patients with metastatic melanoma, compared with the use of chemotherapy alone. Objective responses, survival, and toxicity in the two groups were evaluated at a median potential follow-up of 42 months. In 52 patients randomized to receive chemotherapy, there were 14 objective responses (27%), including four complete responses. In both treatment groups, the duration of partial responses was often short, and there was a trend toward a survival advantage for patients receiving chemotherapy alone (P2 = .052; median survival of 15.8 months compared with 10.7 months). Treatment-related toxicities were greater in patients receiving chemoimmunotherapy.</s><s>The purpose of this randomized trial was to evaluate the efficacy of combination chemoimmunotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone. A total of 124 patients were randomized to receive intravenous cisplatin (35 mg m(-2), days 1-3), carmustine (150 mg m(-2), day 1, cycles 1 and 3 only), dacarbacine (220 mg m(-2), days 1-3) and oral tamoxifen (20 mg m(-2), daily) in combination with (n=64) or without (n=60) sequential subcutaneous IL-2 and IFN-alpha. In patients treated with chemotherapy, only, the overall response rate was 29.9% with eight complete responses (13.3%) and 10 partial responses (16.6%).</s><s>Dacarbazine (DTIC) has been the mainstay of chemotherapy for metastatic melanoma for over two decades, but only 15%-20% of patients respond and benefit is usually transient. We report a randomized prospective pilot Phase III trial of DTIC +IFN-alpha in patients with metastatic melanoma. Differences in survival between groups were assessed using log-rank analysis. There was no significant difference in survival between the two treatment arms (chi2 unadjusted = 0.15, P = 0.70; chi2 adjusted = 0.01, P = 0.91). These results are inconclusive primarily owing to the small size of the trial. A meta-analysis is required to determine whether there is a role for the addition of IFN-alpha to DTIC in the treatment of this disease.</s><s>The purpose of this study was to evaluate in a randomized phase II trial the efficacy and toxicity of combination biochemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone in patients with metastatic melanoma. Evidence for immune activation was determined by flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes. Treatment was repeated every 4 weeks up to six courses depending on response. The overall response rate of BCDT with IL-2/IFN-alpha was 23% [95% confidence interval (CI) 10-40%] with one complete response (CR) and seven partial responses (PR), and for BCDT alone 27% (95% CI 12-46%) with eight PRs; the median durations of response were 2.8 months and 2.5 months respectively. The addition of subcutaneous IL-2 and IFNalpha to BCDT chemotherapy in a randomized phase II trial resulted in immune activation but did not improve response rates in patients with metastatic melanoma, and indeed may increase some treatment-related toxicity.</s><s>Following extensive phase II trials of the combination of dacarbazine and interferon-alpha 2a we performed a prospective, randomized, controlled trial of this combination versus dacarbazine alone as systemic therapy for symptomatic, measurable metastatic malignant melanoma. Therapy consisted of dacarbazine given in combination in escalating doses of 200 mg/m2, 400 mg/m2 and 800 mg/m2 i.v. Therapy was continued for at least 6 months unless overt progressive disease was observed. Eighty seven patients were randomized to the combination and 83 patients to dacarbazine alone. Toxicity was worse in the combination arm, with more patients experiencing fatigue, nausea and anorexia, flu-like symptoms and neutropenia. However quality of life was not significantly different in either group, except that fatigue, as measured at week 12 by LASA scales, and activity, as measured by the functional living index, were both improved in the combination.</s>"

The evaluation suggests that PSI may be too modest in length and scope to have an impact on youths' sexual behavior.</s><s>Conducted in diverse sociocultural communities in Los Angeles County, the project implemented and evaluated a family life education program designed to prevent the negative outcomes of risky sexual behavior. The project sought to improve parent-child communications and delay the onset of sex-related behaviors through direct involvement of parents in the education process. Naturally occurring community groups were randomly assigned by site to treatment or delayed treatment conditions in a longitudinal quasi-experimental evaluation design. The evaluation demonstrated significant improvements in communication between parents and children immediately following the intervention; however, these improvements were no longer present 12 months postintervention. Descriptions of the process evaluation, integrated with the outcome data, are intended to heighten nurses' awareness of the importance of this component of research and the rich qualitative data it may yield.</s><s>The quality of parent-child communications about sex and sexuality appears to be a strong determinant of adolescents' sexual behavior. Evaluations of interventions aimed at improving such communications can help identify strategies for preventing early onset of sexual behavior. In analyses of covariance controlling for baseline scores, immediately after the intervention, adolescents who received the enhanced curriculum reported greater self-efficacy for refusing high-risk behaviors than did those who received the classroom instruction only (mean scores, 16.8 vs. 15.8). In all significant comparisons, the direction of the findings favored adolescents who received the enhanced curriculum. Parent-child homework assignments designed to reinforce and support school-based prevention curricula can have an immediate impact on several key determinants of sexual behavior among middle school adolescents.</s><s>This study was undertaken to determine whether the Adult Identity Mentoring (AIM) project successfully promotes abstinence, delays initiation of sex, and decreases intention to engage in sex. Twenty middle school classes of African-American seventh graders were randomly assigned to receive either the AIM intervention or a standard health education control curriculum. Surveys about sexual activity were conducted before the intervention, 19 weeks after baseline, and again at 1 year after the intervention.

The primary endpoint was the percentage of infants receiving >50% of their nutritional needs via enteral feeding on the 14th day of life. The trial was discontinued after the fourth sequential analysis concluded a lack of effect. No colonization by probiotic strains was detected in infants who weighed < or =1000 g, presumably because of more frequent suspensions of enteral feeding, more courses of antibiotic treatment, or both.</s><s>The goal was to investigate the efficacy of orally administered probiotics in preventing necrotizing enterocolitis for very low birth weight preterm infants. The primary outcome measurement was death or necrotizing enterocolitis (Bell's stage >or=2). Four hundred thirty-four infants were enrolled, 217 in the study group and 217 in the control group. The incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (stage >or=2) was lower in the study group, compared with the control group (4 of 217 infants vs 14 of 217 infants).

Intestinal permeability was measured within two days of birth and then seven and thirty days later using the sugar absorption test. The L/M ratio in the study group was significantly lower at day 30 of the study as compared to the control group (p=0.003).

As compared with the children who received placebo, children who received ondansetron were less likely to vomit both during the first 8-h follow-up in the emergency department [relative risk (RR): 0.33, 95% CI: 0.19-0.56, NNT: 2, 95% CI: 1.6-3.5], and during the next 24-h follow-up (RR: 0.15, 95% CI: 0.07-0.33, NNT: 2, 95% CI: 1.3-2.1).</s><s>Vomiting limits the success of oral rehydration in children with gastroenteritis. We enrolled 215 children 6 months through 10 years of age who were treated in a pediatric emergency department for gastroenteritis and dehydration. The primary outcome was the proportion who vomited while receiving oral rehydration. Although the mean length of stay in the emergency department was reduced by 12 percent in the ondansetron group, as compared with the placebo group (P=0.02), the rates of hospitalization (4 percent and 5 percent, respectively; P=1.00) and of return visits to the emergency department (19 percent and 22 percent, P=0.73) did not differ significantly between groups.</s><s>To compare the efficacy of intravenous ondansetron or dexamethasone compared with intravenous fluid therapy alone in children presenting to the emergency department with refractory vomiting from viral gastritis who had failed attempts at oral hydration. This double-blind, randomized, controlled trial was performed in a tertiary care pediatric emergency department. Children aged 6 months to 12 years presenting with more than three episodes of vomiting in the past 24 hours, mild/moderate dehydration, and failed oral hydration were included. Subjects were randomized to dexamethasone 1 mg/kg (15 mg maximum), ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg, or placebo (normal saline [NS], 10 mL). A total of 166 subjects were enrolled; data for analysis were available for 44 NS-treated patients, 46 ondansetron-treated patients, and 47 dexamethasone-treated patients. In children with dehydration secondary to vomiting from acute viral gastritis, ondansetron with intravenous rehydration improves tolerance of oral fluids after two hours and reduces the hospital admission rate when compared with intravenous rehydration with or without dexamethasone.</s><s>It contributes to fluid loss and is a limiting factor for oral rehydration therapy. Dimenhydrinate has traditionally been used for children with gastroenteritis in countries such as Canada and Germany. Primary outcome was defined as weight gain within 18 to 24 hours after randomization.

In total, 69.6% of the children in the dimenhydrinate group versus 47.4% in the placebo group were free of vomiting between randomization and the follow-up visit. Dimenhydrinate reduces the frequency of vomiting in children with mild dehydration; however, the overall benefit is low, because it does not improve oral rehydration and clinical outcome.</s><s>Vomiting in children suffering from acute gastroenteritis interferes with the oral rehydration process and equally frustrates parents and health care providers. This was a randomized, prospective, double-blind clinical trial in a university-affiliated children's hospital ED. Any patient requiring admission was considered a treatment failure, and no further doses were given. The parents were also required to complete a diary of the same information, which was mailed to the investigators for confirmation of the telephone data. One hundred forty-five patients were enrolled, of whom 51% (n=74) were randomized to ondansetron. During the observation period in the ED, the median number of episodes of vomiting was 0 in both groups, but the rank sum of vomiting episodes was significantly lower in the ondansetron group (P =.001). The number of episodes of emesis in the ED after enrollment ranged from 0 to 7 in the placebo group and 0 to 2 in the ondansetron group. A lower proportion of patients receiving ondansetron compared with placebo required intravenous fluid therapy (P =.015). The admission rate was also lower in patients receiving ondansetron (P =.007). Ondansetron was effective in reducing the emesis from gastroenteritis during the ED phase of oral rehydration and in lowering the rates of intravenous fluid administration and hospital admission.</s><s>We hypothesize that ondansetron will facilitate oral rehydration therapy in children with acute gastritis or acute gastroenteritis and mild to moderate dehydration who fail initial oral rehydration therapy. We hypothesize that subjects receiving ondansetron will tolerate oral rehydration and that a lower proportion will require intravenous hydration than subjects receiving placebo, with a clinically important difference of at least 30% when comparing 2 groups of patients presenting to the ED with acute gastritis/acute gastroenteritis. Subjects received a weight-based dose of ondansetron (0.15 mg/kg of the orally dissolving tablet) or placebo, and oral rehydration therapy was reattempted 30 minutes later. Parents completed symptom diaries and were contacted by telephone for follow-up. In subjects with acute gastritis/acute gastroenteritis and mild to moderate dehydration who failed initial oral rehydration therapy, the proportion of children who received intravenous hydration was smaller in the ondansetron group than in the placebo group.</s>"

The prevalence of TMD in the 24 patients with bruxism was 62.5%%; the corresponding severity, as determined by the pantographic reproducibility index (PRI), was mild (mean value: 20.71). Clicking and pain in the lateral pterygoid muscle were the most frequent clinical manifestations.</s><s>The efficacy of occlusal splints in diminishing muscle activity and tooth-grinding damage remains controversial. Sleep laboratory recordings were made on the second night to establish baseline data. A statistically significant reduction in the number of SB episodes per hour (decrease of 41%, p = 0.05) and SB bursts per hour (decrease of 40%, p < 0.05) was observed with the two devices. Both oral devices also showed 50% fewer episodes with grinding noise (p = 0.06).</s><s>Bruxism occurs in nearly 60% of children between 3 and 5 years, with important repercussions to the different components of the stomatognathic system. Nevertheless, there is little information in the literature about this topic. Cast models were made for both groups, to evaluate the progression of wear facets, during 8 months. On the other hand, of the 5 children that used nocturnal bite plate, showed no increase of wear facets, even after the removal of the device.</s><s>To assess the efficacy of occlusal stabilization splints in the management of sleep bruxism (SB) in a double-blind, parallel, controlled, randomized clinical trial. The number of bruxism episodes per hour of sleep (Epi/h), the number of bursts per hour (Bur/h), and the bruxism time index (ie, the percentage of total sleep time spent bruxing) were established as outcome variables at a 10% maximum voluntary contraction threshold level. A general linear model was used to test both the effects between splint groups and within the treatment phase as well as their interaction for each outcome variable. In individual cases, variable outcomes were found: Some patients had an increase (33% to 48% of the cases), while others showed no change (33% to 48%) or a decrease (19% to 29%) in SB outcome variables. The application of splints should therefore be considered at the individual patient level.</s><s>The objective of this experimental study was to compare the effect on sleep bruxism and tooth-grinding activity of a double-arch temporary custom-fit mandibular advancement device (MAD) and a single maxillary occlusal splint (MOS). Thirteen intense and frequent bruxors participated in this short-term randomized crossover controlled study. Sleep variables, bruxism-related motor activity, and subjective reports (pain, comfort, oral salivation, and quality of sleep) were analyzed with analysis of variance and the Friedman test. However, the exact mechanism supporting this reduction remains to be explained. Hypotheses are oriented toward the following: dimension and configuration of the appliance, presence of pain, reduced freedom of movement, or change in the upper airway patency.</s>"

        "Abstracts": "<s>In a flare of osteoarthritis (OA) pain, increasing the dose of standard anti-inflammatory or routine analgesic drugs may not be practical because of an increased incidence of side effects. This was a multicenter, outpatient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, add-on study. The primary outcome measures were average daily pain intensity and average daily pain relief scores from days 1 through 5. Three hundred eight patients were randomized to tramadoUacetaminophen (n = 197) or placebo (n = 111) and were followed for up to 10 days. Patients had a mean (+/-SD) age of 60.1 +/- 9.87 years, and were predominantly female (71.8%) and white (87.7%). No serious adverse events were reported in the tramadol/acetaminophen group. In this study, addition of tramadol/acetaminophen to NSAID or COX-2-selective inhibitor therapy was well tolerated and effective in the treatment of OA flare pain.</s><s>To evaluate the efficacy and safety of tramadol 37.5 mg/acetaminophen 325 mg combination tablets (tramadol/APAP) as add-on therapy for subjects with osteoarthritis (OA) pain inadequately controlled by COX-2 nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID). Mean final VAS scores for tramadol/APAP plus COX-2 NSAID were significantly lower than placebo plus COX-2 NSAID (41.5 vs 48.3; p = 0.025) and mean final pain relief rating scores were significantly higher (p = 0.002). The most common treatment-related adverse events for tramadol/APAP were somnolence (6.5%), nausea (4.6%), and constipation (3.3%). Tramadol 37.5 mg/APAP 325 mg combination tablets were effective and safe as add-on therapy with COX-2 NSAID for treatment of OA pain.</s><s>The efficacy and safety of a once-daily extended-release formulation of tramadol hydrochloride (tramadol ER) was evaluated in patients with moderate to severe chronic pain of osteoarthritis (OA). This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 12-week study. Tramadol ER was initiated at 100 mg QD and increased to 200 mg QD by the end of 1 week of treatment. After the first week, further increases to tramadol ER 300 mg or 400 mg QD were allowed. Two hundred forty-six patients were randomized (tramadol ER 124, placebo 122). Similarly, outcomes on the WOMAC Pain, Stiffness and Physical Function subscales, the WOMAC Composite Scale, dropouts due to insufficient therapeutic effect, Patient and Physician Global Assessment of Therapy, and Sleep were all significantly better with tramadol ER than placebo (P < 0.001 to < 0.05). Treatment with tramadol ER results in statistically significant and clinically important and sustained improvements in pain, stiffness, physical function, global status, and sleep in patients with chronic pain.</s><s>To investigate how individual patients with painful osteoarthritis (OA) respond to the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diclofenac and the centrally acting analgesic tramadol when individual on-demand dose titration is allowed. The multidimensional 'Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index' (WOMAC) questionnaire (pain, stiffness and functional impairment) was used to assess the effect of the drugs on pain and functional capability. Both treatments modestly improved median pain intensity, paralleled by an improvement in functional parameters, and there were no statistically significant differences between the groups. However, individual treatment effects varied greatly, and within individual patients there were considerable variations in analgesic effectiveness between the two treatments. OA patients' response to analgesic treatment was highly individual and the response to one drug was not predictive of that to another drug. A significant proportion of patients were not treated satisfactorily with diclofenac or tramadol alone. Improvement of functional capability apparently was a consequence of pain relief. Effective pain relief should therefore be the main therapeutic goal in patients with OA where inflammation is less prominent.</s><s>Opioid analgesics may be a useful alternative in patients with osteoarthritis who have not responded to first-line treatment with acetaminophen and in whom nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are contraindicated, ineffective, or poorly tolerated. This study compared the efficacy and tolerability of tramadol LP 200 mg, a new once-daily,sustained-release formulation, with those of placebo in patients with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. The primary efficacy end point was the change from baseline to the end of the study in scores on the Huskisson visual analog scale for pain. Secondary end points were change in the Lequesne functional discomfort index, global efficacy assessed by the patient and the investigator, time to improvement, and use of acetaminophen as rescue analgesic medication. Pain was significantly reduced in the tramadol LP group compared with the placebo group on day 7 (P = 0.002) and day 14 (P = 0.010). Improvement was reported before day 7 in 882% (75) of patients in the tramadol LP group, compared with 65.2% (73) in the placebo group (P = 0.021); the mean time from the initiation of treatment to reported improvement was 3 days for tramadol LP and 6 days for placebo (P < 0.001). In this study, tramadol LP 200 mg was significantly more effective than placebo in alleviating pain in patients with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee.</s><s>Opioids are increasingly used in the treatment of chronic non-malignant pain. Dose titration based on effect was performed with the respective immediate release solutions given additionally to tramadol 100 mg bid and dihydrocodeine 60 mg bid during the first 4 days of the 1 month treatment. Thirty patients with pain controlled by NSAID's alone formed the comparator group. Mean (95% CI) daily doses on days 1 and 28 were 209 (198-220) mg and 203 (191-206) mg of tramadol, and 129 (122-136) mg and 130 (121-134) mg of dihydrocodeine, respectively. Colonic transit times only increased significantly during treatment with dihydrocodeine. Sensation and pain thresholds were lower pre-treatment in both groups than in controls and increased during treatment. Tramadol interfered less with intestinal function and showed greater antinociceptive action.</s><s>Both the analgesic drugs tramadol and paracetamol are widely used for the symptomatic therapy of osteoarthritis (OA). Moreover, we evaluated plasma and synovial fluid concentrations of tramadol and its active metabolite (O-desmethyl-tramadol, M1) after oral treatment with this drug. A group of 10 patients received tramadol (50 mg three times a day), and another group of 10 patients were treated with paracetamol (500 mg three times a day) for 7 days. Both in plasma and synovial fluid the concentrations of M1 were markedly lower than those of tramadol, with a T/M1 ratio of 14.7+/-4.6 and 9.3+/-3.9, respectively. These data demonstrate that the activity of tramadol may involve the modulation of inflammatory mediators. Moreover, they indicate that after oral treatment with tramadol, both the parent drug and its active metabolite can penetrate into synovial fluid.</s><s>To demonstrate that in patients receiving naproxen for the pain of osteoarthritis (OA), the addition of tramadol will allow a reduction in the naproxen dosage without compromising pain relief. This trial consisted of a 5-week open-label run-in and an 8-week double-blind phase. Patients were then randomized in a double-blind manner to continue tramadol 200 mg/day or to begin placebo in addition to naproxen. During the double-blind phase, the naproxen dose was reduced by 250 mg every 2 weeks. The primary efficacy end point was the minimum effective naproxen dose (MEND). The MEND was defined as 250 mg above the naproxen daily dosage at which pain relief was no longer adequate. Among naproxen responders, the MEND was significantly lower in patients receiving tramadol (n = 36) than in patients receiving placebo (n = 54), 221 mg versus 407 mg, respectively (P = 0.021). In patients with painful OA of the knee responding to naproxen 1,000 mg/day, the addition of tramadol 200 mg/day allows a significant reduction in the dosage of naproxen without compromising pain relief.</s>"

Nonparametric bootstrap sampling of costs/QALY ratios established the 95% CI around the estimates. Costs/QALY gained discounted at 3% were $205,186 using the QWB and $32,643 using the CHRD. Confidence intervals around these ratios suggested wide variability of cost effectiveness of aquatic exercise.</s><s>To determine the efficacy of community water-based therapy for the management of lower limb osteoarthritis (OA) in older patients. The latter was accompanied by an economic evaluation comparing societal costs and consequences of the two treatments. Physical function assessments were carried out in established laboratory settings. 106 patients (93 women, 13 men) over the age of 60 years with confirmed hip and/or knee OA took part in the preliminary study. A similar, but larger, group of 312 patients (196 women, 116 men) took part in the main study, randomised into control (159) and water exercise (153) groups. Control group patients received usual care with quarterly semi-structured telephone interview follow-up only. Additional outcome measures were included to evaluate effects on quality of life, cost-effectiveness and physical function measurements. Nearly two thirds of all patients had a significant other illness in addition to their OA. Water exercise remained effective in the main study but overall effect size was small, on WOMAC pain at 1 year, a reduction of about 10% in group mean pain score. Mean cost difference estimates showed a saving in the water exercise group of pound123--175 per patient per annum and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from pound3838 to pound5951 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Further research is suggested into other similar public health interventions. More detailed research is required to develop a better understanding of the types of exercise that will work for the different biomechanical subtypes of knee and hip OA and investigation is needed on access and environmental issues for physical activity programmes for older people, from both a provider and a participant perspective, the societal costs of the different approaches to the management of OA and longer term trends in outcome measures (costs and effects).</s><s>The aim of the study was to evaluate the therapeutic effect of electro-acupuncture (EA) and hydrotherapy, both in combination with patient education or with patient education alone, in the treatment of osteoarthritis in the hip. Forty-five patients, aged 42-86 years, with radiographic changes consistent with osteoarthritis in the hip, pain related to motion, pain on load, and ache were chosen. They were randomly allocated to EA, hydrotherapy, both in combination with patient education, or patient education alone. Pain related to motion and pain on load was reduced up to 3 months after last the treatment in the hydrotherapy group and up to 6 months in the EA group. Ache during the day was significantly improved in both the EA and hydrotherapy group up to 3 months after the last treatment. In conclusion, EA and hydrotherapy, both in combination with patient education, induce long-lasting effects, shown by reduced pain and ache and by increased functional activity and quality of life, as demonstrated by differences in the pre- and post-treatment assessments.</s>"

The symptoms of disorientation, restlessness, inconsolable crying and thrashing resemble an acute psychosis similar to an agitated central anticholinergic syndrome. Multimodal intraoperative and prophylactic pain therapy combined alfentanil, piritramide, diclofenac and regional/local bupivacaine. Five minutes following injection, severe agitation was still present in 10 out of 20 patients treated with physostigmine and 16/20 with placebo.

We studied 50 children undergoing laparoscopy for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Their ages ranged from 3 to 13 years, and all belonged to American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class I or II. Group 1 received caudal block with bupivacaine 1 mL/kg after anesthetic induction. In 2 patients, caudal block was technically difficult and they were excluded from the study.</s><s>The aim of this study was to compare three different pain relief regimes and the respective levels of pain recorded by children undergoing extractions of primary teeth under general anaesthesia. The subjects were 70 children from each site who were aged between 3 and 12 years, and were undergoing routine extractions of primary teeth. The greatest amount of pain was reported by the group who had received no analgesia.</s><s>Laparoscopic nephroureterectomy for dysplastic kidney is now becoming a widely accepted procedure. We report here our initial experience with laparoscopic nephroureterectomy in four girls. Three patients had an ectopic dysplastic kidney with ectopic ureter, and one patient had hydronephrosis with megaureter due to distal ureteral atresia of the upper moiety in a duplicated dysplastic kidney. Laparoscopic nephroureterectomy can be performed safely, with minimal postoperative pain, excellent cosmetic results and early ambulation.</s><s>The purpose of the present study was to comparatively assess the adequacy of postoperative analgesia using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and paracetamol in children undergone \"minor\" surgical interventions. A comparison was made with postoperative analgesia using analgin and promedole (Group 2 (control)). Group 1 comprised 63 patients and Group 2 included 26 patients with identical diseases (inguinal hernias, varicocele, phimosis). Functional parameters were recorded in patients in the lying position before, 30 min, 1, 2, and 3 hours after surgery.</s><s>Pain following tonsillectomy in children is a significant problem that tends to be underestimated. We audited post-operative pain in 33 children and found significant proportions of children in moderately severe to severe pain, particularly at, or soon after returning to the ward. These findings led to changes in practice that included the administration of pre-operative paracetamol and diclofenac as well as the uniform post-operative prescription of them, with printed instructions to reduce the scope for mistakes by medical staff.</s><s>Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (ATIN) is a rare renal disorder in children. Patients usually present non-specific symptoms and signs so that the diagnosis of ATIN is often delayed. The disease may be infection- or drug-induced or it may occur without a known cause. Early recognition and appropriated therapy usually lead to an excellent prognosis. Laboratory studies included urinalysis, complete blood count, erytrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), plasma creatinine, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), electrolytes, proteins, IgG, C3, C4 antinuclear-antibodies (ANA), antistreptolysin-O and antibodies to hantaviruses. Less common complaints included headache, arthralgias and maculopapular rash. ANA were negative in 15 pts in whom this analysis was performed; C3 and C4 levels were normal. Renal US demonstrated enlarged hyperechoic kidneys in 11 pts, in remaining 10 pts no abnormalities were found. Treatment included supportive therapy in all and six patients received prednisolone for 4-8 weeks (40-60 mg/m2/24 h for 10-14 days with subsequent reduction of dose over several weeks). All our patients had normal blood pressure, non-oliguric renal failure, proteinuria, hypostenuria and abnormal urinary sediment; about half of them had glycosuria and/or other signs of proximal tubular dysfunction. The most important causes of ATIN in children reported in literature are systemic infections and drugs. The prognosis of ATIN in children is considered to be favourable, but some patients may develop chronic renal failure. Renal function completely recovered in all our patients; that is consistent with outcome data from the most reports. Early recognition of the disease is important to remove possible aetiologic agents and to treat them before chronic lesions are present to avoid long-term renal damage.</s><s>The purpose of the case-study was to evaluate the efficiency of non-steroid antiinflammatory drugs (NAD) for postoperative analgesia in children after small-scope surgical interventions. Diclofenac, 1 mg/kg per day administered as rectal suppositories or intramuscular injections after initial narcosis, was used for postoperative analgesia in children of the main group; postoperative analgesia made by analgin and promedol in the control group was compared with the former. Clinical examinations and registration of functional parameters were made in patients during certain time periods, i.e. before surgery (in the standing and lying postures) and after surgery (in 20 minutes, as well as in 1, 2, and 3 hours after surgical interventions).</s><s>administration following sub-umbilical surgery in children was studied to investigate its principal site of analgesic action. Sixty children undergoing caudal block during general anaesthesia for hernia repair or orchidopexy were prospectively randomized to one of three groups: the bupivicaine group received plain bupivacaine 0.25% 1 ml x kg(-1); the caudal ketamine group received caudal plain bupivacaine 0.25% 1 ml x kg(-1) with S(+)-ketamine 0.5 mg x kg(-1); the i.v. Postoperative measurements included analgesic requirements and modified objective pain score for the first 24 h.\n                The median time to first analgesia was significantly longer in the caudal ketamine group (10 h) than in the i.v. There was no difference between the groups in the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting or psychomotor reactions.</s><s>We conducted a prospective, randomized study to compare the efficacy of preoperative diclofenac, flurbiprofen, and clonidine, given alone, as well as the combination of diclofenac and clonidine, and flurbiprofen and clonidine in controlling postoperative pain in 125 children. Diclofenac or flurbiprofen was given immediately after induction of anaesthesia. flurbiprofen 1 mg.kg(-1), oral clonidine 4 microg.kg(-1) provided similar OPS scores and requirement for supplementary analgesics during 12 h after surgery. Combination of oral clonidine and one of these nonsteroidal analgesics minimized postoperative pain.</s><s>We compared the effects of rectally administered diclofenac (12.5 mg) with paracetamol (125 mg) on pre- and postoperative behaviour and the need for supplementary analgesia in 44 children scheduled for adenoidectomy (with or without myringotomy). The study drugs were given in combination with diazepam (0.5 mg.kg-1) about 20 min before the children were taken to the operating theatre. During recovery, children in the diclofenac group needed fewer supplementary doses of intravenous pethidine than those receiving paracetamol (p < 0.001). The pre-operative rectal administration of diclofenac for pain relief after adenotomy is safe and effective.</s><s>Extra-meningeal and non-cutaneous manifestations of meningococcal infection are well recognized but rare. In the case presented, the prostacycline analogue iloprost was used in an attempt to minimize incipient digital gangrene ina patient with evidence of protracted immunological phenomena. Laparotomy demonstrated ischaemia and ulceration in the caecum, and histology revealed full thickness mucosal ulceration with a prominent vasculitic process. It is also possible that NSAID use contributed to the findings via cyto-toxicity to mucosal cells.</s><s>A seven-year-old girl received intramuscular injection of diclofenac for symptomatic treatment of her fever. We should work more aggressively to evaluate the potential infection rather than treat the fever only. If it is necessary to lower the body temperature, external cooling, oral medication would suffice.</s><s>We investigated the analgesic effect of intra-operative intravenous diclofenac in a randomized, double blind placebo-controlled paralled group study after adenoidectomy in 150 children aged 1-7 years. A standard anaesthetic method was used and all children received oral diazepam as premedication. after induction of anaesthesia followed by an infusion of diclofenac 1 mg/kg over 2 hours. At the end of procedure the children were transferred to the recovery room for continuous monitoring of vital signs and assessment of pain. It was therefore concluded that intravenous diclofenac given intra-operatively has analgesic effect in the immediate post-operative period and it is recommended for small children during adenoidectomy.</s><s>The authors noticed a marked increase in the incidence of reactionary post-operative haemorrhage after tonsillectomy during the course of 1992.

Induction and maintenance of anaesthesia were with remifentanil and propofol. Patients were discharged to the ward with a new PCA morphine programme (a demand dose 20 micro g.kg-1 with a lockout time of 30 min, for 4 h), and total morphine consumption was recorded. The mean total morphine consumption of the diclofenac group was less than the control group in the PACU (130.33 +/- 11.26 and 169.92 +/- 9.22, respectively, P=0.012) and the ward (50.80 +/- 11.38 and 87.77 +/- 10.55, respectively, P=0.021).</s><s>The purpose of this pilot study was to compare the effects of sublingual morphine with intravenous morphine in the treatment of postoperative pain following adenotonsillectomy in children. There was no statistical significant difference in any of these parameters between the two groups.</s><s>We studied 80 children, aged 5-13 yr, who received PCA with morphine after appendicectomy using a standardized tracheal general anaesthetic. All patients received morphine 0.1 mg kg-1 before surgical incision and all had wound infiltration with bupivacaine 1 mg kg-1 at the end of surgery. Analgesia, as assessed by movement pain scoring, was significantly improved by the addition of diclofenac despite lower morphine consumption.</s><s>This is a prospective randomized double-blind trial conducted to determine whether preoperative orally administered clonidine causes or potentiates postoperative vomiting in 140 children (3-12 yr) undergoing strabismus surgery. All children received inhalational anaesthesia with halothane and nitrous oxide in oxygen. The incidence and frequency of vomiting were compared in the groups with Kruskall-Wallis Rank test. These data suggest that preanaesthetic medication with clonidine 4 micrograms.kg-1 may be useful for preventing emesis following strabismus surgery. This property of clonidine indicates that it may be superior to other sedative premedicants such as diazepam and midazolam.</s><s>Postoperative conditions in hospital and at home were evaluated in 200 paediatric daycase patients by using questionnaires and telephone interviews. Pain was assessed by behaviour observation or a faces rating scale depending on age. When the effects of intraoperatively administered analgesics wore off at home almost half the children rated higher than mild pain.</s><s>Analgesia-based sedation techniques are becoming more established in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. After receiving ethical committee approval, a prospective randomized, double-blind study was performed. Analgesic infusion was titrated to predefined levels of analgesia [behavioral pain scale (BPS) score of 3]. There were no differences in groups regarding demographics, tracheal extubation times, and pain scores of the patients. We conclude that a remifentanil infusion provides clinically comparable analgesia with a fentanyl infusion in mechanically ventilated postoperative pediatric patients.</s><s>Both caudal anaesthesia and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been used in the management of postoperative pain in children. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the combination of caudal analgesia and rectally administered diclofenac in the treatment of pain following minor surgery in children. It would appear that the combination of a caudal block and rectal diclofenac in children undergoing minor lower abdominal surgery reduces the need for subsequent analgesia.</s><s>Kartagener's syndrome (KGS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the clinical triad of bronchiectasis, sinusitis and dextrocardia (situs inversus). We describe the case of a young boy who underwent lobectomy under general anaesthesia using a single lumen tube.</s><s>In order to establish an effective drug regimen, we compared the analgesic efficacy of oral diclofenac and high-dose acetaminophen on pain after tonsillectomy. In this randomised, double-blind study 48 children, 5 to 15 years of age, following tonsillectomy were assigned to receive either diclofenac 2-3 mg kg(-1) 24 h(-1) (n=24) or acetaminophen 90 mg kg(-1) 24 h(-1) (n=24) for the first three days after surgery. Pain scores in the diclofenac group were only significantly lower at 12 h on day 1-3 compared to pain scores in the acetaminophen group (P<0.05). None of the children in the diclofenac group experienced any episodes of nausea/vomiting compared to 9 children in the acetaminophen group on day 1.</s><s>To compare two techniques for pediatric tonsil surgery with respect to pain and postoperative morbidity. The two methods were the partial tonsil resection using radiofrequency (RF) technique (tonsillotomy [TT]) versus traditional tonsillectomy (TE). Prospective clinical randomized study in one tertiary care ENT clinic and two secondary care clinics. Randomization was performed from the waiting list, including children with both a history of obstructive problems and recurrent tonsillitis. The TT was performed with a specially made sling electrode using a cut/coagulation mode. There was significantly less bleeding in the TT group, although two cases of primary postoperative bleeding occurred among the TT children and one in the TE group.</s><s>Nausea, vomiting and pain are common complications after strabismus surgery in children. The children were consecutively operated upon from May 1999 to January 2001. Anaesthesia was induced with fentanyl and propofol and maintained with propofol. The postoperative pain was assessed after arrival at the post anaesthesia care unit (PACU) by using the validated Wong and Baker scale (FACES) Pain Rating Scale. The incidence of PONV was much higher, 72% (P = 0.0000), in the morphine group, where 56% of the children also had severe vomiting. Diclofenac given rectally is an effective analgesic for this kind of surgery and gives less postoperative nausea than i.v.</s><s>Two hundred and fifty children undergoing herniotomy or orchidopexy under general anaesthesia were randomly allocated to receive pre-operatively either diclofenac sodium 1 mg.kg-1 given intramuscularly or a caudal injection of bupivacaine 0.25% 1 ml.kg-1 with or without adrenaline or no analgesia. Plasma diclofenac and beta-endorphin concentrations were determined in eight and 21 patients respectively. Postoperative pain was assessed by ward nurses who were blinded to the group allocation. Comparison with the control group showed diclofenac to be an effective analgesic. Caudal bupivacaine provided more pain-free children during the early postoperative hours, but later the need for pethidine as rescue analgesic was lower among the children who had received intramuscular diclofenac.</s><s>Peri-operative use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in children.</s><s>The effects of three different inhalation anesthetics (sevoflurane, isoflurane and halothane) delivered with oxygen and nitrous oxide during surgery and of postoperative analgesics on degree %% postoperative sedation immediately following removal of the tracheal tube, in the recovery room and thereafter in the surgical ward, were studied in 74 pediatric patients under 12 years of age. They underwent elective surgical procedures including repair of inguinal hernia, orchidopexy, tonsillectomy, repair of cleft lip and certain orthopedic procedures. There were no significant differences in sedation score between the group of patients who received analgesics and the group of those who did not, and many patients had satisfactory sedation scores in the surgical ward, suggesting that appropriate administration of postoperative analgesics is possible.</s><s>One hundred and ninety-eight children, aged 3 to 12 years, who were scheduled for tonsillectomy were randomly allocated to receive either diclofenac 1.0 mg.kg-1 or papaveretum 0.2 mg.kg-1 by intramuscular injection after induction of anaesthesia. However, the incidence of above average bleeding in the recovery room was significantly higher in the diclofenac group (p < 0.05). In both treatment groups there was an association between bleeding and restlessness during recovery so the increased bleeding in the diclofenac group may not be a direct effect.</s><s>The purpose of the case study was to compare the adequacy of anesthetic management and the specificity of the early postoperative course with preventive analgesia (group 1) and without it (group 2). In as far as the hemodynamic course is concerned, both types of anesthesia were adequate. The main differences were registered in the assessment of the early postoperative period.</s><s>Sotos' syndrome ellipsis...a rare challenge?</s><s>Because of its pain-attenuating and sedative properties oral ketamine has been used as premedication in children and adults. We wanted to compare in children scheduled for adenoidectomy safety and efficacy of oral ketamine with a premedication that causes similar preoperative sedation and relief of pain at the venepuncture site. No other differences were found between the ketamine and diazepam/diclofenac groups before and after premedication until induction of anaesthesia. During the first 10 min postoperatively, the score for stridor was significantly higher in group KS than in the D-groups; stridor scores > or = 6 were seen in one child of the D-groups (DS) and in six children of the K-groups (n.s. Glycopyrrolate diminished salivation in all groups, but had no effect on stridor scores. glycopyrrolate before the induction of anaesthesia significantly reduced the scores for salivation.</s><s>Tonsillectomies have been performed on a same-day basis in Coventry for the past three years. In common with the experience of others, it is possible to perform tonsillectomies safely on a same-day basis.</s><s>Data concerning metabolism of diclofenac in children are limited to intravenous and enteric coated oral formulations. There are no data examining diclofenac or its hydroxyl metabolite pharmacokinetics after rectal administration in children. A single compartment, first order absorption and first order elimination model was used to describe diclofenac pharmacokinetics. Published data from 11 children given enteric-coated diclofenac tablets were used to assess relative bioavailability. Mean (sd) age and weight of the patients were 4.5 (1.5) years and 20.5 (4.1) kg. The formation clearance to 4'-hydroxydiclofenac (% CV) and to 5'-hydroxydiclofenac were 8.41 (8.1) and 3.41 (113) l.h(-1) respectively, standardized to a 70 kg person using allometric '1/4 power' models. The suppository formulation had an absorption half-life of 0.613 (33.2) h with a lag time of 0.188 (24.9) h. Interoccasion variability of formation clearance to 4'-hydroxydiclofenac, diclofenac volume of distribution, absorption half-time and lag time for the suppository was 36%, 55%, 14% and 119%, respectively. The relative bioavailability of the suppository compared with an enteric-coated tablet was 1.26. This pharmacokinetic profile renders diclofenac suppository a suitable formulation for short duration surgery.</s><s>In a randomized double-blind study 60 children, undergoing the extraction of carious deciduous teeth under day-case general anaesthesia, were assigned to receive either intravenous nalbuphine hydrochloride 0.3 mg kg-1 (n = 21), one or more diclofenac suppositories 12.5 mg to a dose of 1-2 mg kg-1 (n = 19), or no analgesia (n = 20). There were no statistically significant differences in post-operative pain scores during the 45 min post-operative period studied between the three groups using an objective pain score.</s><s>Forty-three children for day case inguinal herniotomy under general anaesthesia were assigned randomly to receive either 1 ml/kg caudal bupivacaine 0.25% or rectal diclofenac 0.25 mg/kg intra-operatively to provide postoperative analgesia. Pain and demeanour were assessed by an observer in the early postoperative period after operation and by questionnaire for the parents over the first 24 hours. Rectal diclofenac is a useful alternative to caudal blockade in this group of patients.</s><s>To compare the analgesic efficacy of diclofenac sodium and paracetamol on post adenotonsillectomy postoperative pain and oral intake. All children were observed for postoperative pain, oral intake, vomiting, temperature and complications. Children who received diclofenac sodium had significantly less pain, less elevation of temperature, more oral intake, and started drinking significantly sooner than the paracetamol group. The time to first solid intake was significantly earlier in the diclofenac sodium group (p < 0.0001). With regard to complications, one patient in each group developed secondary hemorrhage, one child developed otitis media in the 2nd group.</s><s>A controlled investigation was conducted to compare the effectiveness of diclofenac and papaveretum in the prevention of pain and restlessness after tonsillectomy in children. Sixty children between 3 and 13 years of age were randomly allocated to receive rectal diclofenac 2 mg/kg, intramuscular papaveretum 0.2 mg/kg or no medication immediately after induction of anaesthesia. No significant differences in postoperative pain were found between the groups at any time. Consumption of paracetamol on the day of operation was significantly less in the diclofenac group.</s><s>Codeine analgesia is wholly or mostly due to its metabolism to morphine by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2D6, which shows significant genetic variation in activity. Ninety-six children received either codeine 1.5 mg kg(-1) or morphine 0.15 mg kg(-1) in a randomized, double-blind design. Genetic analysis was performed and plasma morphine concentrations at 1 h were determined. Forty-seven per cent of children had genotypes associated with reduced enzyme activity. Mean (SD) morphine concentrations were significantly lower (P<0.001) after codeine [4.5 (0.3) ng ml(-1)] than after morphine [24.7 (1.5) ng ml(-1)], and morphine and its metabolites were not detected in 36% of children given codeine. Neither phenotype nor morphine concentration was correlated with either pain score or the need for rescue analgesia (r=-0.21, 95% confidence interval -0.4, -0.01). Codeine analgesia is less reliable than morphine, but was not well correlated with either phenotype or plasma morphine in this study.</s><s>Forty boys weighing less than 25 kg undergoing unilateral orchidopexy were randomly allocated to receive one of two analgesic regimens. Group C received a caudal epidural block with 0.25% bupivacaine 1 ml.kg-1 and preservative-free ketamine 0.5 mg.kg-1; Group L received an ilioinguinal nerve block with 0.25% bupivacaine 0.5 ml.kg-1 and infiltration of the wound with 0.25% bupivacaine 0.5 ml.kg-1. The median duration of analgesia was 10 h (range 2.6 to > 24 h) in Group C and 2.9 h (range 0.7 to > 24 h) in Group L (p < 0.05). Subjects in Group L required significantly more doses of postoperative analgesia than those in Group C (p < 0.05).</s><s>Many studies have been carried out on the effects of anaesthetic drugs and methods on the immune response, but pain and its relief also affect the immune response. We measured systemic immune responses in the blood circulation and local responses in the surgical wound when non-steroidal anti-inflammatory analgesics (NSAIDs), opioids or epidural blockade was used in the peri-operative treatment of pain. Responses were measured in 51 children, aged from 2 to 12 years and undergoing major surgery under balanced anaesthesia. The only difference related to the analgesic method was shorter duration of post-operative leucocytosis and lower phytohaemagglutinin (PHA)-induced lymphocyte proliferative responses in peripheral blood in the opioid group than in the NSAID or epidural groups.</s><s>The analgesia provided for children is often less than for adults with the same underlying pathology. Regular non-opiate analgesia, calculated according to weight, was administered. Significantly more mPCA was demanded (t = 2.02, P < 0.02) and morphine received (t = 2.02, P < 0.005) by adults than children following appendicectomy. Children appear to require and do demand less analgesia than adults following appendicectomy to maintain similar postoperative pain scores. Acceptable pain scores may be achieved by the administration of regular analgesia to these patients.</s><s>This prospective study looked at the postoperative hemorrhage risk associated with the use of diclofenac following cleft palate repair. Twenty consecutive children (6 months to 9 years of age) requiring repair of the hard or soft palate were included. Single per rectum doses of diclofenac were given at 1 mg/kg following cleft palate repair, with additional doses every 12 hours. The authors find that twice daily diclofenac rectal suppositories provide very good analgesia postcleft palate repair.</s><s>This prospective, randomized, double-blind study compared the analgesic efficacy of oral diclofenac resinate 0.5 mg.kg(-1) with paracetamol 15 mg/kg(-1) for control of postoperative pain in paediatric patients for outpatient bilateral myringotomy and tube insertion. Paracetamol, the most commonly used oral analgesic for paediatric patients, was compared with a new palatable syrup formulation of diclofenac. Sixty-three ASA 1 orA SA 2 children aged one year and above were randomly assigned to receive diclofenac (Group A) or paracetamol (Group B). Anaesthesia was induced with either inhalational sevoflurane or intravenous thiopentone. Overall, CHEOPS scores were low for both groups at all times and did not differ between the groups at any time.</s><s>Ketamine efficacy as an analgesic adjuvant has been studied in several clinical settings with conflicting results. Fifty children were randomized to receive premedication with either ketamine 0.1 mg kg(-1) i.m. The ketamine group showed significantly lower pain scores both at rest and on swallowing, with less total paracetamol consumption (P < 0.05) during the 24 h after surgery. There were no differences in the incidence of vomiting or dreaming between the groups.</s><s>Vt and total plasma clearance were higher than in adults but the elimination half-life was similar.</s><s>Pain control for paediatric patients undergoing tonsillectomy remains problematic. These drugs were given as a single injection following induction of anaesthesia. There were no statistically significant differences in age, weight, type of operation or induction of anaesthesia, 4-h sedation and pain scores and further analgesic requirements. The various pharmaceutical presentations and the availability as a noncontrolled substance may make it a useful addition to paediatric anaesthesia if it becomes licensed for paediatric anaesthesia in the UK.</s><s>Oral versus rectal diclofenac for postoperative tonsillectomy pain in children.</s><s>We hypothesized that increasing duration of inhalation anaesthesia is associated with slower emergence and recovery in children, and that this effect would be less marked with desflurane in comparison with isoflurane. Fifty-four infants and children assigned in groups according to age and expected length of operation were prospectively randomized to receive either isoflurane (I) or desflurane (D) for anaesthesia. Clinical evaluation of recovery was made by observers, blinded to group allocation. In the group >4 yr of age, the median (95% CI) times in minutes to first movement [4.42 (D), 11.6 (I)], eye opening [8.55(D), 18.0(I)] and extubation [7.08 (D), 16.7 (I)] were significantly shorter (P<0.001) for desflurane. There were no significant differences in incidence of airway irritation or emergence delirium between the two agents.</s><s>Sixty-one children were randomized to receive one of three methods of analgesia for day case circumcision. CHEOPS pain scoring was performed in the recovery area, one h after awakening and two h after awakening.</s><s>Chronic intake of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been reported to cause side-effects distal to the duodenum. This is the first case report on colon perforation occurring in an adolescent (16-year-old girl) after short-term diclofenac intake.</s><s>Diclofenac sodium was assessed as an analgesic for postoperative pain following paediatric tonsillectomy in a randomised double blind trial. No significant difference in analgesic efficacy was demonstrated between the two drugs, although patients who received diclofenac tended to be less drowsy postoperatively than those who received pethidine. There were no significant differences between the two drugs in respect of time to awaken from anaesthesia or incidence of postoperative vomiting.</s><s>The treatment of postoperative pain in children has been given special attention in the last decades. This study aimed at analyzing postoperative analgesia in children, considering analgesia quality and duration, evaluation methods reliability and the incidence of side effects resulting from different analgesia techniques. In the first 4 hours, groups B, F, M and S patients presented similar behavior, with a minimum need for complementary analgesia. In the remaining 20 hours, the longest analgesia duration was seen in group S, which did not differ from groups F and M, but was significantly longer than for groups B and D. Rectal diclofenac has not promoted effective pain relief. Rectal diclofenac was not effective as a single analgesic as compared to other techniques.</s><s>Pharmacokinetic profile of rectally administered diclofenac sodium in children undergoing adenotonsillectomy</s><s>We studied 133, ASA I or II children, aged 5-12 years undergoing general anaesthesia for simple dental extractions. Induction and maintenance of anaesthesia were achieved using sevoflurane in nitrous oxide and oxygen. Pain scores were recorded on a 4-point scale as follows: 0 = I don't hurt at all; 1 = I hurt a bit; 2 = I hurt a lot; 3 = I hurt the most.</s><s>We investigated the efficacy and side-effects of a concept for pain therapy after tonsillectomy in children. A total of 100 children aged between 6 and 14 years were treated according to the following protocol for pain therapy after tonsillectomy: after induction of anaesthesia the children received 35-40 mg/kg acetaminophen rectally and 0.1 mg/kg piritramide i.v.. Additionally, boluses of 0.05 mg/kg pitritramide i.v. were allowed in the recovery room and 2 doses of 20 mg/kg acetaminophen were given rectally every 6 h on the day of surgery. 7 patients suffered a postoperative haemorrhage, 4 out of the 7 needed a surgical revision and 2 out of 100 patients vomited. We conclude that this protocol for pain therapy after tonsillectomy was effective.</s><s>Both rectal diclofenac and paracetamol are commonly used to treat acute postoperative pain in children but combining them to improve the quality of analgesia is controversial. One hundred and eight patients were randomly assigned to receive either rectal diclofenac 1 mg.kg(-1) or paracetamol 40 mg.kg(-1) or their combination 1 h prior to surgery.</s><s>In this prospective study techniques for the subcutaneous ring block of the penis and subpubic block of the penis for analgesia after circumcision were compared. Side effects and analgesic requirements in hospital were recorded post-operatively. Four of the 24 boys who had subpubic penile blocks and nine of the 16 boys who had subcutaneous ring blocks were given morphine for post-operative pain (P = 0.015). The surgeons complained about oedematous tissues in three patients, all of whom had had subcutaneous ring blocks.</s><s>127 children scheduled for elective tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy were studied. There were no significant differences in blood loss between the groups or between nausea and vomiting scores. The pain scores in the diclofenac with fentanyl group were significantly lower at one h and four h than the group receiving diclofenac alone (P = 0.008 and 0.02 respectively).</s><s>This study compared the effectiveness and side-effects of intra-operative fentanyl with fentanyl and morphine for elective adenotonsillectomy in a double-blind study, in 60 children randomly allocated to receive either intravenous fentanyl 1 microg x kg(-1) intra-operatively or intramuscular morphine 100 microg x kg(-1) at induction. Pain scores, emetic episodes and supplemental morphine requirements were recorded for 24 h postoperatively. The overall incidence of postoperative vomiting was high in both groups: 70% in the fentanyl group and 78% in the morphine group.</s><s>Our objective was to compare the recovery characteristics of sevoflurane and halothane for short day-case anaesthesia in a specifically limited age group of children 1-3 yr.\n                Eighty unpremedicated children undergoing day-case adenoidectomy were randomly assigned to receive inhalational induction with either sevoflurane 8% or halothane 5% and nitrous oxide in oxygen (70/30) via a face mask. Anaesthesia was continued with the volatile anaesthetic, adjusted to maintain heart rate and blood pressure within +/-20% of initial values. A postoperative questionnaire was used to determine the well-being of the child at home until 24 h after discharge. Emergence and interaction occurred significantly earlier after sevoflurane than halothane but discharge times were similar. More children in the sevoflurane group achieved full Aldrete scores within the first 30 min after anaesthesia, although this group suffered more discomfort during the first 10 min. Apart from more vomiting with halothane and more discomfort during the first 10 min after awakening with sevoflurane, the quality of recovery was similar with the two anaesthestics.</s>"

        "Abstracts": "<s>A hospital's change from a traditional, multitiered incident-reporting system for medication errors to a standardized, nonpunitive medication-use variance process is described. Its guiding principles were as follows: anonymity and freedom from punitive action are essential for increasing the number of reports, rating medication errors facilitates identification of areas for system improvement, potential errors provide valuable insight into the system's vulnerabilities, and timely review of reports enables rapid systematic correction. A one-page medication-use variance report was developed that prompted the reporter for key data elements, including root causes, patient outcomes, and possible ways to prevent similar incidents. The most difficult decision for the task force was deciding whether the process should be anonymous. The number of reports from these units increased compared with historical trends, and for the first time potential errors were reported. Despite these positive results, task force members remained divided on the issue of anonymity but ultimately embraced the nonpunitive culture. The resulting database serves as a trigger for quality improvement efforts and a measure of their effectiveness.</s><s>Baylor University Medical Center (Dallas) converted patient occurrence reporting from a paper form to a custom-built Web-based system that used the medical center's intranet. The project team, representing the Center for Quality and Care Coordination and information services, decided that the best approach would be a phased implementation based on development of system functionality and a facility's readiness for conversion. Reporting was to be conducted in terms of 10 standardized patient occurrence reporting categories. It is still an individual responsibility to report and then transform collected data into usable information, which will drive process improvement. The focus must shift to reporting as a cornerstone to quality and safety and away from traditional notions of error and blame.</s><s>To design a Web-based system to track adverse and near-miss events, to establish an automated method to identify patterns of events, and to assess the adverse event reporting behavior of physicians. Adverse event frequency was compared with hospital databases to assess reporting completeness. The automated pattern recognition system helped identify 4 event patterns from M&M reports and 3 patterns from anonymous/near-miss reporting. We have developed a user-friendly Web-based system to track complications and identify patterns of adverse events. Underreporting of adverse events and attributing the complication to the nature of the disease represent a problem in reporting culture among surgeons at our institution. Similar systems should be used by surgery departments, particularly those affiliated with teaching hospitals, to identify quality improvement opportunities.</s>"

When expressed per gram fat, milk retinol was higher in the vitamin A group only at 4 weeks. However, although most infants had deficient vitamin A stores (MRDR>0.06%) at 26 weeks, vitamin A to infants, but not mothers, resulted in a lower proportion of infants with deficient vitamin A stores (69 v. 78 %).

The results suggest that the technique is useful for the management of hemodynamics and water-sodium retention after cardiopulmonary bypass.</s><s>We evaluated the effects of human atrial natriuretic peptide (hANP) during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Forty patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting were investigated. Parameters examined were hemodynamics, urine volume, dosage of furosemide, respiratory index, pleural effusion, ANP, cyclic guanosine monophosphate, renin activity (renin), angiotensin-II, aldosterone, and glomerular filtration rate. The hANP group showed significantly higher levels of ANP, cyclic guanosine monophosphate, glomerular filtration rate, and respiratory index, and significantly lower levels of renin, angiotensin-II, aldosterone, and pleural effusion, as compared with the non-hANP group. The dosage of furosemide was significantly lower and the urine volume was significantly larger in the hANP group.</s><s>Acute renal failure (ARF) is a serious complication following liver transplantation. When administered intravenously, URO induces strong diuresis and natriuresis with tolerable hemodynamic side effects. Preliminary non-controlled clinical studies demonstrate beneficial effects using URO as a therapeutic agent in patients suffering from ARF following heart and liver transplantation (HTx, LTx). These results prompted us to initiate this first controlled clinical trial to investigate whether URO infusion can improve renal function in patients with emerging ARF following LTx. The primary parameters for efficacy was the frequency of hemodialysis/hemofiltration. The frequency of hemodialysis/hemofiltration during URO or placebo infusion was significantly reduced (P = 0.03) in the URO-treated patients in comparison with placebo. We conclude that URO seems to be a new approach for the treatment of therapy-resistant postoperative ARF following LTx.</s><s>Acute renal failure is associated with significant morbidity and mortality rates. Need for dialysis is an independent risk factor for early mortality after complicated cardiac surgery. Exogenous administration of h-ANP increases glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow in clinical acute renal failure. Sixty-one patients with normal preoperative renal function suffering from postcardiac surgical heart failure requiring significant inotropic and vasoactive support. Secondary renal outcome variables were dialysis-free survival at day 21 and creatinine clearance. Eight (28%) patients in the h-ANP group compared with 17 (57%) in the placebo group suffered from the combined end point dialysis or death before or at day 21 (hazard ratio, 0.35; 95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.82; p =.017).</s><s>In first uncontrolled clinical trials, Urodilatin revealed beneficial effects in the prophylaxis and therapy of acute renal failure following heart and liver transplantation. Urodilatin infusion can prevent acute renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy. Urodilatin infusion was started postoperatively with a dose of 40 ng / kg bw / min for 6 days. In contrast, the remaining 6 patients of each group developed oliguria / anuria and required subsequent hemofiltration / hemodialysis. Cumulative duration of hemofiltration (88 +/- 7.39 hours in the placebo treated patients versus 44 +/- 5.35 hours in the Urodilatin treated patients, p < 0.</s><s>This hormone exhibits an N-terminal extension by four amino acids compared with atrial natriuretic peptide. In initial uncontrolled clinical trials, this peptide was shown to have beneficial effects in patients suffering from oliguric acute renal failure. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, dose-finding trial recruiting 176 patients randomized into 4 different Ularitide doses groups (U5, U20, U40, and U80 ng/kg/min) and a placebo group (U0). Ularitide/placebo infusion was performed for 5 days with half the originally infused dose on day 5. The primary objective of the study was to test various doses of Ularitide in patients suffering from oliguric acute renal failure to avoid mechanical renal replacement therapy during the first 12 hours. Diuresis increased in the Ularitide-treated groups and the placebo group after onset of infusion and did not show any significant difference in the first 12 h collection period (U0: 576, U5: 514, U20: 500, U40: 360, U80: 158 ML/12h (Median), (p = 0.16)).</s><s>Radiocontrast-induced nephropathy (RCIN) is a common cause of hospital-acquired acute renal failure and is associated with a high mortality rate. RCIN is potentially preventable, because administration of the radiocontrast agent is predictable, and a high-risk population has been identified. Patients with stable chronic renal failure (serum creatinine greater than 1.8 mg/dL or serum creatinine between 1.5 and 1.8 mg/dL with estimated creatinine clearance of < or = 65 mL/min) were assigned to receive either placebo or one of three doses of anaritide (0.01 microg/kg/min, 0.05 microg/kg/min, or 0.1 microg/kg/min) for 30 minutes before and continuing for 30 minutes after radiocontrast administration. RCIN was defined as either an absolute increase of serum creatinine of > or = 0.5 mg/dL or a percent increase of > or = 25% over baseline. There were no statistical differences in baseline serum creatinine, change in serum creatinine, or the incidence of RCIN. The incidence of RCIN was placebo, 19%; anaritide (0.01), 23%; anaritide (0.05), 23%; anaritide (0.1), 25%. In conclusion, administration of intravenous anaritide before and during a radiocontrast study did not reduce the incidence of RCIN in patients with preexisting chronic renal failure, with or without diabetes mellitus.</s><s>Acute renal failure occurring immediately after liver transplantation and requiring hemodialysis is a major problem resulting in a poor prognosis. We investigated the efficacy of human atrial natriuretic peptide, which has potent natriuretic effects and unique protective effects for glomeruli in preventing acute renal failure after liver transplantation. Thirty-seven patients who underwent live donor liver transplantation with model for end-stage liver disease scores greater than 15 were the subjects of the study. There were no statistical differences in the changes in hemodynamic status between groups. Hemodialysis was required after liver transplantation in nine patients, two in Group H and seven in Group C (P=0.04).</s><s>Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), an endogenous hormone synthesized by the cardiac atria, has been shown to improve renal function in multiple animal models of acute renal failure. In a recent multicenter clinical trial of 504 patients with acute tubular necrosis (oliguric and nonoliguric), ANP decreased the need for dialysis only in the oliguric patients. Subjects were randomized to treatment with a 24-hour infusion of ANP (anaritide, 0.2 microgram/kg/min; synthetic form of human ANP) or placebo. Dialysis-free survival rates were 21% in the ANP group and 15% in the placebo group (P = 0.22). One hundred two of 108 (95%) versus 63 of 114 (55%) patients in the ANP and placebo groups had systolic blood pressures less than 90 mm Hg during the study-drug infusion (P < 0.001). This well-characterized population with oliguric acute renal failure had an overall high morbidity and mortality.</s><s>Atrial natriuretic peptide, a hormone synthesized by the cardiac atria, increases the glomerular filtration rate by dilating afferent arterioles while constricting efferent arterioles. We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of anaritide in 504 critically ill patients with acute tubular necrosis. Other end points included the need for dialysis, changes in the serum creatinine concentration, and mortality. The rate of dialysis-free survival was 47 percent in the placebo group and 43 percent in the anaritide group (P = 0.35). Anaritide-treated patients with oliguria who no longer had oliguria after treatment benefited the most. The administration of anaritide did not improve the overall rate of dialysis-free survival in critically ill patients with acute tubular necrosis.</s><s>Acute renal failure is a severe complication following major cardiac surgery. The effects of urodilatin were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind trial in patients suffering from incipient acute renal failure following cardiac surgery. In the urodilatin group (n = 7) acute renal failure was reverted, whereas in the placebo group (n = 7) six patients had to be haemofiltered or haemodialysed (P < 0.005).</s><s>Acute renal failure after major abdominal surgery is a severe complication in critically ill patients in intensive care units (ICU). The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of urodilatin on the peak value and course of serum creatinine in patients with acute renal insufficiency after major abdominal surgery and the necessity of apparatus-based renal replacement treatment. Peak serum creatinine was lower in the urodilatin group (4.65 +/- 0.57 mg/dl) compared to vehicle treatment (5.78 +/- 1.58 mg/dl), although the difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.148). The total number of hemodialyses due to oligo-/anuria and/or hyperkalemia was the same in both groups during the study. No hemodynamic side effects or adverse events due to urodilatin were observed.</s><s>This study was performed to investigate the effects of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and mannitol on renal blood flow (RBF) and radiocontrast-induced nephropathy (RCIN) in human subjects with chronic renal failure. ANP preserves glomerular filtration rate or RBF (or both) in severe animal models of acute renal failure. Radiocontrast is known to substantially decrease RBF and can induce acute renal failure. Twenty consecutive patients with chronic renal failure (60% with diabetes) were randomized in a prospective, double-blind fashion to receive either ANP (50 micrograms bolus, then 1 microgram/min infusion) or mannitol (15% at 100 ml/hr) for 2 hours before and during cardiac catheterization with diatrizoate. ANP levels rose significantly from baseline at 5, 15, 65 and 120 minutes in both groups (p less than 0.05). In conclusion, RBF was maintained or increased despite administration of radiocontrast, a documented renal vasoconstrictor. Mannitol may induce ANP release, thus contributing to mannitol's renal effects.</s>"

In groups A and B, urinary pyridinoline and deoxypyridinoline at 6, 9, and 12 months were significantly reduced in comparison with basal values and group C (P < .05). Pyridinoline and deoxypyridinoline levels were lower in group A than in group B throughout the study, but not significantly. In group A serum calcium levels were significantly increased after 6 months.</s><s>A prospective, randomized clinical trial observed the effects of Norplant long-term contraceptive implants and domestic implants similar to Norplant on bone mineral density and bone metabolism in female acceptors for 1 year. Bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) of lumbar 2-4 and proximal femur of 61 normal women of child-bearing age were measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) before and 12 months after implants insertion in both groups. BMD and BMC of lumbar 2-4 in both groups 12 months after implant insertion significantly increased (p < 0.01); with an average increase of 2.40% and 3.34%, respectively in the Norplant implant group, and 2.75% and 4.47%, respectively in the domestic implant group. There was no significant effect on achieving maximum bone mass in young women.</s><s>In this prospective, controlled, randomized study, we compared the effect of a low-dose 21-day combined oral contraceptive (COC) containing 20 microg ethinyl estradiol (EE) and 75 microg gestodene (GTD) (Group A; n = 19) with an ultra-low-dose 24-day COC containing 15 microg EE and 60 microg GTD (Group B; n = 18) on bone turnover and bone mineral density (BMD) in young, fertile women. At baseline and after 12 months BMD was determined at lumbar spine by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in all patients. At 12 months, no statistically significant difference in spinal BMD values was detected between the three groups and in comparison with basal values.</s><s>A formulation of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) has been developed that allows subcutaneous injection (104 mg/0.65 mL; DMPA-SC) and achieves highly effective contraception with a similar tolerability profile to intramuscular DMPA (150 mg/mL; DMPA-IM). A total of 225 women completed the first 2 years of this study (DMPA-SC, n=116; DMPA-IM, n=109). After 2 years of DMPA use, BMD loss was marginally smaller in the DMPA-SC group than in the DMPA-IM group at both the total hip (-3.3% and -3.6%, respectively) and lumbar spine (-4.3% and -5.0%, respectively). In those women who received DMPA during the third year, there were no statistically significant differences in BMD loss between DMPA-SC and DMPA-IM groups at the end of Year 3. Adverse events were similar in the two groups except that injection site reactions were more common in the DMPA-SC group. DMPA-SC is an effective and well-tolerated contraceptive option, providing comparable efficacy and BMD safety to DMPA-IM.</s><s>The purpose of this clinical trial was to evaluate the effect of estrogen supplementation on bone mineral density in adolescent girls who received depot medroxyprogesterone acetate for contraception. The main outcome was bone mineral density that was measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry for 12 (n = 69) to 24 (n = 36) months. Participants, technicians, and physicians were blinded to estrogen treatment. Over the 24-month period, the percentage of change from baseline bone mineral density at the lumbar spine was 2.8% in the estradiol cypionate group versus -1.8% in the placebo group ( P <.001).</s><s>The aim of the study was to evaluate if a pill containing the same dose of the same type of progestin compound (gestodene, GES, 75 microg) but different doses of ethinylestradiol (EE2) (20 or 30 microg) differently influences specific markers of bone resorption (urinary levels of pyridinoline (PYR) and dexoxypyridinoline (D-PYR)). These findings suggest that similar to the pill containing 30 microg EE2, the lower dosage of the EE2 pill (20 microg) is also capable of reducing bone resorption. However, an additional effect of the progestin compound that could act directly on progestin or estrogen receptors of bone cannot be excluded. Since contraception with a pill containing the lowest estrogen dose is associated with the lowest incidence of side effects, these findings further suggest a pill containing 20 microg EE2 for young post-adolescent women would be the best choice.</s><s>To compare the effect of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) and two types of oral contraceptives (OC) on bone mineral density (BMD) among women 18-33 years of age with those not using hormonal contraception. Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate was administered to 33 women; 63 women who chose oral contraception were randomly assigned to receive either a norethindrone-containing pill (n = 28) or a desogestrel-containing pill (n = 35). We analyzed method-related percent change in BMD while controlling for body mass index, calcium intake, exercise, and smoking. We had approximately 90% power to detect a 2.5% difference between any two groups. Observed changes in BMD among DMPA users differed from women who used either type of pill (P < .002).

Overall, the continuous and cyclic regimens affected metabolic variables similarly. The larger increase in SHBG with the continuous COC is consistent with a higher net oestrogenic effect due to a lower daily dose of LNG. Prospective studies are required to determine the long-term effects of this continuous COC regimen.</s><s>The aim of the study was to compare bone mineral density (BMD) before insertion and at 18 months of use of etonorgestrel- and levonorgestrel-releasing contraceptive implants. One hundred and eleven women, 19-43 years of age, were randomly allocated to two groups: 56 to etonorgestrel and 55 to levonorgestrel. BMD was evaluated at the midshaft of the ulna and at the distal radius of the non-dominant forearm using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry before insertion and at 18 months of use.

As compared to baseline, bone mineral density decreased by 0.4% in the 20/100 group and by 0.8% in the 30/150 group after 36 treatment cycles. These changes were not significantly different between the two treatment groups (p = 0.902). With respect to cross-linked N-telopeptides (NTx), we detected a decrease of the mean NTx urine concentrations of 21.1% (20/100) and of 13.4% (30/150). These changes also did not significantly differ between the two treatments (p = 0.613).

The clinical pregnancy rate was 26.3% (67/255) in the US-guided transfer group compared with 18.1% (47/260) in the clinical touch transfer group (P < 0.05). US-guided embryo transfer increased pregnancy and implantation rates in IVF cycles, as well as the frequency of easy transfers. It is recommended that embryo transfer should be performed under US guidance.</s><s>To determine whether the use of ultrasound (US) to guide embryo transfer (ET) in a population previously defined as likely to have easy transfer would change the implantation and pregnancy rates in an ICSI program. Implantation and pregnancy rates were similar (p = 0.51, p = 0.29) for Group I (19.6%, 42%) and Group II (16.3%, 30%), as also was the abortion rate (p = 0.55) (Group I: 1/21; Group II: 2/15).</s><s>To investigate the effect of ultrasound-guided embryo transfer on the rate of implantation and clinical pregnancy. A prospective randomized trial was performed to compare ultrasound-guided embryo transfer with the traditional method. For the cases (n = 178), ultrasound-guided was used; controls (n = 152) was performed using routine methods.</s><s>In a prospective and randomized study on 400 consecutive embryo transfers (ETs), the performance of three different transfer catheters was evaluated. A better pregnancy rate (19.4%/ET) can be achieved when TDT catheter was used under ultrasound guidance. The Frydman catheter (Prodimed, Neuilly-en-Thelle, France) yielded the highest pregnancy rate (32.3%/ET) but also the highest frequency of difficult transfer procedures. Therefore, the Frydman catheter is used as the first choice, and for difficult transfers the TDT catheter under ultrasound guidance can be recommended.</s><s>Recent reports suggested that ultrasound guidance during embryo transfer might improve the pregnancy rate. A prospective randomized controlled trial was performed to compare embryo transfer under ultrasound guidance versus the clinical touch method. A total of 800 embryo transfers was studied; 400 were randomized to ultrasound-guided transfers and 400 were randomized to the clinical touch group. The clinical pregnancy rate was 26.0% in the ultrasound-guided group and 22.5% in the clinical touch group; the difference was not statistically significant.</s><s>We wanted to test the hypothesis that using abdominal ultrasound at the time of embryo transfer to guide replacement, improved pregnancy rates by at least 5%. There was no difference in clinical pregnancy or live birth rates between the two groups. We set out to determine whether ultrasound-guided embryo transfer improved clinical pregnancy rates and live birth rates in assisted conception. This outcome is at odds with the UKs National Institute of Clinical Excellence recommendations for fertility treatment (Fertility Assessment and Treatment for People with Fertility Problems. which used a meta-analysis of four smaller trials (range 362-800 patients, totalling 2051 embryo transfers) to conclude that ultrasound should be offered.</s><s>To determine whether the implementation of ultrasound (US) guidance will improve the clinical outcomes of ET compared with the standard clinical touch method of embryo catheter placement. Secondary outcomes were the incidences of difficult transfers, blood and/or mucus on the catheter tip, spontaneous miscarriages, and ectopic pregnancies. Demographics and cycle characteristics were not different between the two groups. In addition, there was a significantly higher number of clinical pregnancies in the US ET group (75 of 183, 40.98%) than in the clinical touch ET group (54 of 190, 28.42%) (odds ratio = 1.75, 95% confidence interval 1.14-2.69).</s><s>To determine whether the use of abdominal ultrasound-guided embryo transfer improves the clinical pregnancy rate in patients undergoing in vitro fertilization, 50 fresh cycles with day 3 embryo transfer were studied; 27 patients were randomized to ultrasound-guided transfers, and 23 patients were randomized to clinical touch transfers.</s>"

        "Abstracts": "<s>This study compared the impact on carbohydrate metabolism of two combinedoral contraceptives (COCs). This open-label, single-center trial enrolled participants for a total of 15 cycles. Fasting blood glucose at cycle 13 was significantly (p < 0.01) higher for both treatment groups compared to baseline. Gestodene and desogestrel in combination with 20-microg ethinyl estradiol induce similar changes in carbohydrate metabolism which are smaller than those described earlier for COCs containing higher estrogen doses or more androgenic progestins such as levonorgestrel.</s><s>The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of a contraceptive pill containing ethinylestradiol (30 mcg) and drospirenone (3 mg) in a continuous regimen on lipid, carbohydrate and coagulation parameters. No statistically significant differences were found between the two contraceptive regimens with respect to carbohydrate or lipid profiles or in the parameters related to coagulation.</s><s>Body weight, fasting blood glucose (GP) (BFG), serum immunoreactive insulin (IRI), serum growth hormone (GH) and serum glycosylated proteins were longitudinally followed in 2 groups of women during two years' oral contraception. After 6 months' use of either preparation, GH significantly increased, remained on that level throughout the study and returned to the pretreatment level after discontinuation of the pill.</s><s>To compare the effects of a combined oral contraceptive (COC) containing nomegestrol acetate and 17β-oestradiol (NOMAC/E2) on haemostasis, lipids, carbohydrate metabolism, C-reactive protein (CRP) and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) with those of a COC containing levonorgestrel and ethinylestradiol (LNG/EE). Over six cycles, NOMAC/E2 had less effect on most haemostatic indices than LNG/EE. Lipids were essentially unchanged with NOMAC/E2, whereas with LNG/EE high-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides slightly increased.</s><s>The effects of two differing dosage schedules of ethinyloestradiol and levonorgestrel, taken cyclically as oral contraceptives, on blood pressure, body mass, blood glucose and serum triglycerides were measured. There was a small but statistically significant increase in body mass after 1 year in the group taking levonorgestrel 15 microgram and ethinyloestradiol 30 microgram (P < 0,02), but not in the other group, although the mass in this group was significantly increased after 3 months of therapy. This effect appears to be dose-related and progressive with continued therapy; the significance of these results is discussed.</s><s>Combination oral contraceptives (OCs) have little effect on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in normal-weight women. Based on lack of change in intermediate markers, as well as results of epidemiologic studies, low-dose OCs do not increase the risk of diabetes or cardiovascular disease. Obesity is a risk factor for impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes and coronary artery disease, and most previous OC studies excluded these women; thus, we have limited information about carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in obese OC users. Women were randomized to two pills: 30 mcg ethinyl estradiol (EE)/150 mcg levonorgestrel (LNG) or 20 mcg EE/100 mcg LNG. Obesity had little effect on any OC-induced changes in carbohydrate or lipid metabolism except for a borderline adverse interaction between obesity and OC dose with respect to fasting glucose and a positive interaction between obesity and OC use with respect to LDL cholesterol.</s><s>To compare carbohydrate metabolism, adrenal and thyroid function during use of a combined contraceptive vaginal ring (NuvaRing, NV Organon, Oss, The Netherlands) with those of a combined oral contraceptive. Each cycle comprised 3 weeks of use of the ring or the pill followed by 1 ring- or pill-free week. Concentrations of cortisol binding globulin and total cortisol rose significantly less during ring use than during combined oral contraceptive use (cycle 3, p= 0.0002; cycle 6, p < 0.0001).</s><s>The effect on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism of two hormonal contraceptive preparations containing norethisterone (commercially known as Mesigyna and TriNovum) was studied in a total of 60 women, before and after 6 months of treatment. At the end of treatment, no difference was found within or between groups in fasting glucose and insulin levels and in glucose rate of disappearance. A significant increase in total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and VLDL-cholesterol was found in both groups at the end of the treatment period; in addition, TriNovum caused a significant increase also in triglycerides. In conclusion, the safety of both preparations with regard to carbohydrate metabolism was confirmed using the most accurate method available; furthermore, changes in lipid metabolism were such as to have little clinical significance.</s><s>One hundred thirty women were randomly assigned to treatment with one of three triphasic oral contraceptives and 43 women using nonhormonal methods served as controls for a 6-month study of the metabolic effects of these formulations. One of the oral contraceptives contained ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel, and the other two contained ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone. Compared with pretreatment assessment, all three triphasic oral contraceptives produced small increases in the mean plasma glucose levels that were statistically significant but clinically unimportant. No subjects had abnormal glucose response curves in glucose tolerance test results.</s><s>The study was conducted to investigate whether hormonal contraceptives administered via the oral and vaginal route exert a similar effect on insulin sensitivity (SI). This is a prospective, randomized study performed in the University Hospital. SI and glucose utilization independent of insulin (Sg) were evaluated by the minimal model method. Modifications of total, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides were also evaluated. SI decreased during OCs (5.74+/-0.49 vs. 3.86+/-0.44; p=.0005), independently of the high/low-estrogen dose. Triglycerides increased during both oral (p=.01) and vaginal (p=.032) contraceptive use.</s><s>Second-generation and third-generation oral contraceptives containing 30 mcg or more of ethinylestradiol (EE) decrease insulin sensitivity (SI). SI and glucose utilization independent of insulin (Sg) were investigated by the minimal model method. SI decreased with EE/DSG (7.09+/-1.4 vs. 4.30+/-0.91; p=.04; n=12), but not with EE/CMA (5.79+/-0.93 vs. 6.79+/-1.1; p=.48; n=12). SI modifications observed in the two groups were significantly different (-2.79+/-1.15 vs. 1.0+/-1.38; p=.05). The C-peptide/insulin response increased with both EE/DSG (p=.05) and EE/CMA (p=.04).</s><s>A comparative study of the metabolic effects of two combined oral contraceptive preparations was undertaken in seven WHO Collaborating Centres for Research in Human Reproduction. The NET/EE preparation appeared to induce a greater increase in triglycerides, but no significant difference was found between the two pill preparations with respect to HDL-cholesterol changes.</s><s>The results of a prospective longitudinal controlled study comparing some metabolic effects of a low-dose levonorgestrel-ethinyl oestradiol combined oral contraceptive (Microgynon 30), a desogestrel-ethinyl oestradiol-containing pill (Marvelon) and a levonorgestrel-ethinyl oestradiol triphasic preparation (Triquilar) after one year of treatment in ethnic Chinese women are presented. Serum cholesterol levels are similar for the three pills at 6 and 12 months of treatment.</s><s>Blood glucose and pyruvate, plasma insulin, and glucagon levels as well as erythrocyte insulin receptors were measured during an oral glucose tolerance test in 38 normal women before and after 6 months' use of one of three new oral contraceptives containing low doses of 19 nortestosterone-derived progestogens, levonorgestrel, and desogestrel. We did not find any argument in favor of the development of a state of insulin resistance in women using these compounds, because erythrocyte receptor binding was not modified and plasma insulin responses to glucose were decreased.</s><s>This multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, open-label study was conducted to compare the effects of gestodene (GTD) 60 microg/ethinylestradiol (EE) 15 microg and desogestrel (DSG) 150 microg/EE 20 microg (Mercilon) on selected metabolic measurements during six cycles in 124 healthy women. GTD/EE subjects received a single pill once daily from days 1 to 24 of a 28-day cycle, followed by placebo pills daily for the last 4 days of the cycle. Safety was assessed from changes in hemostatic measurements, lipid profile, glucose tolerance and adverse events. The incidence of adverse events was comparable between groups, and no significant differences in cycle control were observed between groups. The 24-day GTD 60 microg/EE 15 microg formulation and DSG/EE produced similar effects on hemostatic balance, lipid metabolism and glucose tolerance, and exhibited comparable efficacy and tolerability.</s><s>A randomized double-blind study of the metabolic effects of 2 low-dose combined oral contraceptives was carried out in Singaporean women. Blood samples were taken on admission and at 3 and 12 months after pills or insertion of IUDs. LNG/EE group only showed significant increase of 2h glucose at 12 months and decrease of LDL cholesterol at 3 months while total cholesterol was significantly suppressed at 3 and 12 months [corrected]. While NET/EE suppressed albumin significantly, this was not observed with LNG/EE group. However, these differences observed with use of each pill preparations, were not so obvious between treatment groups and control. On the contrary, there was a reduction of abnormal values in most liver function parameters. Thus, except for glucose intolerance, the observed changes in metabolic parameters may not constitute any clinical significance.</s><s>In this open-label, randomized study we compared the influence of a new oral contraceptive containing 30 microg ethinylestradiol and 3 mg drospirenone (Yasmin) with a reference preparation containing 30 microg ethinylestradiol and 150 microg desogestrel (Marvelon) on variables of carbohydrate metabolism by means of oral glucose tolerance tests at baseline and in the 6th and 13th treatment cycle. All blood glucose and insulin values measured in the oral glucose tolerance tests were within normal ranges, despite a slight increase in the mean areas under the curves of 0-3 h [AUCs (0-3 h)] of both variables from baseline to treatment cycle 13. Free fatty acid levels decreased by 42% in the drospirenone group and increased by 48.9% in the desogestrel group, in terms of means of individual changes. Both preparations were well tolerated and equally efficacious regarding contraception and cycle control. The combination with drospirenone had less impact on blood pressure than the combination with desogestrel.</s><s>This study was designed to compare the effects of two low-dose triphasic oral contraceptives (OCs) on glucose tolerance and insulin secretion. Fifty-seven women were randomized to receive OCs containing ethinyl estradiol and either levonorgestrel or norethindrone. Glucose tolerance and insulin secretion were measured at baseline and at 6 and 12 months after an oral glucose stimulus.</s><s>Two groups, each composed of 20 women, who used depomedroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) or norethisterone enanthate (NET-EN) injectable contraceptives were investigated for changes in 75-g OGTT and in the fasting and two-hour post oral glucose load (2-hours) levels of serum insulin, growth hormone, glucagon, cortisol and blood pyruvate. Changes with DMPA started after 3 months, and increased with the duration of use to become maximal after 12 months. Although significant changes in blood glucose levels occurred with both DMPA and NET-EN, yet they did not reach the lower cut-off levels for impaired glucose tolerance in any user.</s><s>This study compared metabolic, hormonal and lipid profiles before and during use of a contraceptive vaginal ring (RING) releasing 15 mcg ethinyl estradiol (EE) and 120 mcg etonogestrel per day NuvaRing, Organon USA Inc., Roseland, NJ versus a low-dose oral contraceptive (PILL) containing 20 mcg EE and 100 mcg levonorgestrel daily (Aviane, Barr Pharmaceuticals Inc., Pomona, NY). Sixty-five women were randomized to either the RING or PILL treatment for five cycles. The lower-dose, nonoral hormonal RING had a lesser impact on carbohydrate metabolism and greater reduction of free androgen and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels than PILL treatment.</s><s>The metabolic and hemostatic effects of two oral contraceptives containing 150 mcg desogestrel and 20 mcg ethinyl-estradiol (EE) (MERCILON) or 30 mcg EE (MARVELON) were compared in order to examine the effect of reducing the EE dose in contraceptive pills. The increase in renin substrate was significantly higher with the 30 mcg EE than with the 20 mcg EE pill. In both groups, plasminogen increased significantly, but antithrombin III, total and free protein S and fibrinogen decreased significantly only in women taking the 30 mcg EE pill, whereas there was no significant change in the 20 mcg EE group. Reducing the dose of EE in oral contraceptives from 30 mcg to 20 mcg minimizes their impact on renin substrate and hemostatic parameters.</s><s>The effects of extended regimens of combined oral contraceptives (COCs) on carbohydrate metabolism are largely unknown. The present study compared the effects of a COC containing 30 microg ethinylestradiol and 2 mg dienogest (EE/DNG) in conventional and extended-cycle regimen over 1 year. Blood samples were taken in a control cycle, and at 3 and 12 months of treatment. For both regimens, the response to the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) showed a slightly impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance at 3 months. In general, the effects of both regimens were moderate and mostly transient.</s><s>The objective of the study was to assess the possible differences in effects of Implanon and Norplant implants on carbohydrate metabolism. This is a 2-year open randomized study of 80 implant (Implanon and Norplant) acceptors. Glycosylated hemoglobin A(1)C was measured in fasting samples and plasma samples during OGTT were tested for glucose and insulin levels. There was no significant difference in the carbohydrate parameters between the two groups during implant use, except for a minimal but statistically significant rise in fasting glycosylated hemoglobin A(1)C levels at 24 months in the Implanon group. Both implants appear to induce mild insulin resistance but no significant change in serum glucose levels.</s><s>This study compared the effects of two triphasic oral contraceptives (OCs) taken for 6 pill cycles. There were no effects on body weight, dietary habits, blood pressure, HDL-cholesterol or carbohydrate metabolism. Coagulation factor VII and fibrinogen were increased and antithrombin III levels reduced, indicating that both preparations had pro-coagulant activity. The metabolic effects were similar despite the lower total steroid dose of the gestodene preparation.</s><s>A 6-month single-blind study compared the use of a progestagen-only oral contraceptive containing norethisterone 350 micrograms/day (NE 350) with one containing levonorgestrel 30 micrograms (LN 30), to assess the metabolic effects. At the end of 6 months, there were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to plasma cholesterol, lipoproteins including HDL subfractions, triglycerides or glucose concentration. Levels of fibrinogen, plasminogen, Factor VII, Factor X and antithrombin III were also similar. Women changing from a combined oral contraceptive to LN 30 showed a significant fall in Factor X.</s><s>Desogestrel (DSG) is a less-androgenic progestogen than levonorgestrel (LNG). To test the hypothesis, a prospective 9-month randomized comparison of plasma lipids, glucose, insulin, hemostasis, and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) was conducted in 66 healthy women using phasic formulations of OCs containing either DSG (DSG-OC) or LNG (LNG-OC). The study results showed that SHBG increased 3-fold with DSG-OC and 2-fold with LNG-OC. LNG-OC decreased HDL(2)-C and increased HDL(3)-C; HDL-C was unchanged and LDL-C decreased transiently. Both OCs slightly enhanced procoagulant and profibrinolytic parameters to the same extent except for internally compensating decreases in Factor V and protein S with DSG-OC.</s><s>This study was undertaken to compare the effects of 2 oral contraceptive regimens on menstrual cycle control and laboratory findings. A triphasic preparation of 500, 750, and 1000 microg norethindrone with 35 microg ethinyl estradiol (Ortho-Novum 7/7/7 or TriNovum) was given to 167 women for 1 to 4 cycles of treatment. In the levonorgestrel with ethinyl estradiol group, there was a statistically significantly longer latent period and a statistically significantly shorter withdrawal bleeding episode. Changes in triglyceride and glucose concentrations were not statistically significantly different between groups.</s><s>A 1-year, longitudinal, multicenter study was undertaken to monitor the effects of two once-a-month, injectable contraceptive preparations, Mesigyna (norethisterone enanthate, 50 mg, and estradiol valerate, 5 mg) and Cyclofem (medroxyprogesterone acetate, 25 mg, and estradiol cypionate, 5 mg) on carbohydrate metabolism and liver function. Both preparations induced minor changes in glucose tolerance, with a slight elevation of glucose response and minimal changes in insulin response to a glucose challenge. These changes were greater with Mesigyna but were of no clinical relevance in either group. With regard to liver function, both preparations induced a rise in bilirubin, a decrease in alkaline phosphatase, and no change in enzyme serum levels.</s><s>To compare the effect of ethinyl estradiol 20 microg/drospirenone 3 mg (EE 20 microg/DRSP 3 mg) administered according to a 24/4 regimen with ethinyl estradiol 20 microg/desogestrel 150 microg (EE 20 microg/DSG 150 microg) administered according to the conventional 21/7 regimen on lipid, carbohydrate and hemostatic parameters. In this open-label study, healthy women were randomized to EE 20 microg/DRSP 3 mg or EE 20 microg/DSG 150 microg for seven cycles. Secondary variables included changes in other lipid, hemostatic and carbohydrate parameters. Overall, the differences in lipid, hemostatic or carbohydrate parameters were not significant between the two treatments.</s><s>The hormonal components of combined oral contraceptives (COCs) have various metabolic and haemostatic effects. The objective of this study was to compare the metabolic and haemostatic effects of a novel COC comprising estradiol valerate/dienogest (E(2)V/DNG) with ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel (EE/LNG). In a randomized, open-label study conducted in Germany over seven cycles, healthy women aged 18-50 years received E(2)V/DNG (E(2)V 3 mg on days 1-2, E(2)V 2 mg/DNG 2 mg on days 3-7, E(2)V 2 mg/DNG 3 mg on days 8-24, E(2)V 1 mg on days 25-26, placebo on days 27-28; n = 30) or EE/LNG (EE 0.03 mg/LNG 0.05 mg on days 1-6, EE 0.04 mg/LNG 0.075 mg on days 7-11, EE 0.03 mg/LNG 0.125 mg on days 12-21, placebo on days 22-28; n = 28). Mean ± SD LDL cholesterol decreased by 6.5% ± 15.9% with E(2)V/DNG and by 3.0% ± 17.4% with EE/LNG. Mean ± SD prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 and D-dimer levels remained essentially unchanged in the E(2)V/DNG group (-0.6% ± 30.3% and -2.1% ± 43.5%, respectively), but increased in the EE/LNG group (by 117.3% ± 358.0% and 62.9% ± 99.5%, respectively). Body weight and blood pressure remained stable throughout the study in both treatment groups. Both formulations were well tolerated, with no serious adverse events reported.</s><s>Resistin is a hormone secreted by adipose tissue that could be involved in the development of insulin resistance. We found that serum resistin level remained unchanged in women receiving ethinylestradiol/desogestrel and was reduced in women treated with formulations containing gestodene. We conclude that ethinylestradiol combined with desogestrel or gestodene is unlikely to induce insulin resistance through resistin pathway.</s>"

Patients were kept at a left lateral tilt position of 15 degrees and were unaware which gas was administered. The cord vein PO2 of the group receiving oxygen was 34 mm Hg (SD 6), significantly higher (p less than 0.01) than the value of 26 mm Hg (SD 7) in the group receiving room air. The cord artery PO2 of the oxygen group was also significantly higher (p less than 0.05) at 20 mm Hg (SD 6) versus 15 mm Hg (SD 6). There was no significant difference in the cord vein-artery PO2 differential.</s><s>Despite changes in pulmonary function, maternal oxygenation is maintained during obstetric regional blocks. Good fetal oxygenation is the main justification; however, this has not been proven. Arterial blood gases of 20 parturients undergoing spinal block with different inspired fractions of oxygen were evaluated and correlated with fetal arterial blood gases.</s><s>To analyze maternal and fetal well-being with and without the application of oxygen therapy. Randomized trial of full-term parturients who had received prenatal care during pregnancy. We assessed the well-being of the neonate immediately after birth with the Apgar test and by measuring umbilical cord blood gases. The PO2 in venous blood also differed significantly: 25.53 mm Hg vs 28.13 mm Hg, respectively (P=033). Breathing supplemental oxygen or not during elective cesarean delivery of healthy parturients under spinal anesthesia does not have a significant effect on neonatal well-being.</s><s>Oxygen supplementation is given routinely to parturients undergoing Caesarean section under regional anaesthesia. While the aim is to improve fetal oxygenation, inspiring a high oxygen fraction (FIO2) can also increase free radical activity and lipid peroxidation in both the mother and baby. At delivery, the oxygen group had greater maternal arterial PO2 [mean 30.0 (SD 6.3) vs 14.2 (1.9) kPa; mean difference 15.8 kPa, 95% confidence interval 12.9-18.7 kPa, P<0.001] and greater umbilical venous PO2 [4.8 (1.0) vs 4.0 (1.4) kPa; mean difference 0.8 kPa, 95% confidence interval 0.0-1.5 kPa, P=0.04] compared with the air group.

UV PO2 levels increased from 28 +/- 1 to 36 +/- 1.5, 41 +/- 1.3 and 47 +/- 1.2 torr in the hyperoxic groups. Oxygen saturation and blood O2 contents increased in maternal and fetal blood. There was no difference in 1- or 5-minute Apgar scores between the normoxic and hyperoxic groups. It is concluded that maternal hyperoxia improves fetal oxygen stores and acid-base status during cesarean section under epidural anesthesia.</s><s>The benefit of administering supplementary oxygen during elective Caesarean section under regional anaesthesia is controversial. It has been hypothesized that its use would improve fetal oxygenation in the event of a prolonged uterine incision-to-delivery (U-D) interval. Our aim was to test this hypothesis in a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, controlled study. There were no differences in UV or UA blood gases, oxygen content or Apgar scores between cases with and without a prolonged U-D interval. In cases with a prolonged U-D interval, administering 60% oxygen increased UV PO(2) (4.6 (0.6) vs 3.9 (0.8) kPa, P=0.019) compared with air but there was no difference in UV oxygen content. Supplementary oxygen did not increase fetal oxygenation in cases where the U-D interval was prolonged.</s><s>Simple O2 mask has been used in patient under regional anesthesia for increasing the FiO2, especially in the aged and the pregnant.

The results showed that there were no significant differences in the umbilical arterial or venous pH, partial pressure of oxygen and partial pressure of carbon dioxide between any of the three groups. We also assessed the patient acceptability of oxygen administered by facemask vs. nasal cannulae should the need for supplementary oxygen arise.</s><s>The aim of this investigation was to determine whether supplementary oxygen provided by either nasal cannula or face mask versus room air might affect fetal oxygenation during elective cesarean section under spinal anesthesia by assessing maternal and neonatal regional cerebral oxygenation (rSO(2)) with a cerebral oximeter. Ninety parturients were randomly allocated into three groups: two groups received 5 L/min oxygen by either nasal cannula (Group NC, n = 30) or face mask (Group FM, n = 30), respectively, and the third group was allowed to breathe room air (Group RA, n = 30). After maternal mean arterial pressure, heart rate and peripheral oxygen saturation had been monitored, rSO(2) was determined by cerebral oximeter.

        "Abstracts": "<s>The objective of this study was to compare the rates of bacterial contamination of expressed breast milk (EBM) obtained by manual expression and breast pumps in mothers of very low birthweight (VLBW) infants (<1501 g). Breast milk expressed by breast pumps (86.3% or 44/51 specimens) had a significantly higher rate of bacterial contamination than milk expressed by the manual method (61.0% or 25/41 specimens) (P= 0.005). When breast milk was expressed in the hospital, there was no significant difference in contamination rates between the two methods.</s><s>Many mothers of very low birthweight infants are breast pump-dependent for weeks or months and need a breast pump that is efficient, effective, comfortable, and convenient. All 100 mothers initiated lactation with the CBP and were randomized to single- and multiphase suction patterns in the SBP when daily milk output was at least 350 mL/day. Protocol II included 65 mothers who compared single- and multiphase patterns in the SBP for 7 days and then returned to the CBP for 5 days. However, all other measures of efficiency and efficacy were not significantly different, including milk output at 5-minute intervals. Similarly, mothers in Protocol II rated the SBP significantly (P < 0.05) more comfortable than the CBP, regardless of the specific pattern in the SBP.</s><s>Milk production was examined in 39 lactating mothers of non-nursing preterm infants from 2 tertiary care centers. A logistic regression model including frequency of kangaroo care, frequency of pumping, high versus low income, and previous breastfeeding experience was predictive of mothers producing adequate versus inadequate milk volume 79% of the time. All of the mothers producing > 3500 g at week 2 produced adequate amounts of milk at weeks 4 and 5. Of the remaining mothers who produced 1700 g to 3500 g at week 2, 54% achieved adequate production during weeks 4 and 5 postpartum.</s><s>This study compared sequential single-breast pumping with simultaneous double-breast pumping using an interrupted time series design to determine if (a) milk volume differed by pumping regimen; (b) the time needed to pump the breasts differed by pumping regimen; and (c) the milk fat concentrations differed by pumping regimen. In both limited and unlimited pumping sessions, the simultaneous double pumping option obtained higher mean milk volumes, reaching statistical significance in three of the four comparisons.</s><s>Maternal obesity is associated with poor breastfeeding outcomes, yet no intervention has been developed to improve them. In Bassett Improving Breastfeeding Study (BIBS) 1, 40 women received targeted breastfeeding support in the hospital and via telephone or usual care. In BIBS 2, 34 obese mothers received a manual or electric breast pump to use for 10-14 days or no pump; data collection was similar. When analyses were adjusted for this, there was no difference in BIBS 1 between targeted and usual care groups and in BIBS 2 among the treatment groups in the proportion of women still breastfeeding at the times studied. In future studies of obese women, stratified randomization may be necessary.</s><s>Primary: to compare sequential and simultaneous breast pumping on volume of milk expressed and its fat content. Women were randomly allocated to use either simultaneous (both breasts simultaneously) or sequential (one breast then the other) milk expression. Stratification was used to ensure that the groups were balanced for parity and gestation. Milk yield per expression was: sequential pumping with no massage, 51.32 g (95% confidence interval (CI) 56.57 to 46.07); sequential pumping with massage, 78.71 g (95% CI 85.19 to 72.24); simultaneous pumping with no massage, 87.69 g (95% CI 96.80 to 78.57); simultaneous pumping with massage, 125.08 g (95% CI 140.43 to 109.74). The fat concentration in the milk was not affected by the increase in volume achieved by the interventions. The results are unequivocal and show that simultaneous pumping is more effective at producing milk than sequential pumping and that breast massage has an additive effect, improving milk production in both groups.</s><s>Mothers of premature infants have difficulty maintaining their milk supply as a result of the separation that occurs between the mother and the baby. The hypothesis in the present investigation is that use of a bilateral (simultaneous) breast pumping system will increase the volume of milk expressed in these mothers. Thirty-two breastfeeding mothers of premature infants were randomly assigned to either the control (single) or the experimental (bilateral) breast pump group. Data analysis included average STAI scores; average prolactin levels; and weekly averages for number of pumping sessions, hours of pumping, and milk production in milliliters. The amount of time spent pumping, however, was statistically less for mothers who used the bilateral pump (7.6 +/- 3.0 hours/week) versus those who used the single pump (11.1 +/- 3.1 hours/week) (p = .003). Health professionals should advocate use of the bilateral pump for mothers of premature infants.</s><s>Recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization (WHO) identify exclusive breastfeeding for the first half-year of life and continuation of breastfeeding into toddlerhood as offering maximum protection from illness, providing a substrate for immunological protection. Preterm infants, most at risk for morbidity and mortality in developing countries, are identified as needing their own mother's milk for survival. The objective of this study was to compare mean daily MMV for mothers of premature or sick infants in special care nurseries (SCN) using one of three methods of OMM expression: electric breast pump, non-electric pedal breast pump, and hand (manual) expression. In this randomized trial, mothers were randomly assigned to one of three milk expression groups at birth. MMV for the electric and pedal pump and hand milk expression was 578 +/- 228 ml (n = 22), 463 +/- 302 ml (n = 24) and 323 +/- 199 ml (n = 19), respectively. Findings revealed greater MMV with electric breast pumps than hand-expression for mothers of infants in African nurseries. Funded by West Virginia University Department of Research and Graduate Studies HSC Grant # 2U023U; Non-monetary donations of breast pumps and breast pump kits were made by Medela (Medela, Inc., McHenry, IL, USA).</s><s>Many women whose premature infants are hospitalized in a newborn intensive care unit choose to express breast milk for their babies. Yet anxiety, fatigue, and emotional stress are powerful inhibitors of lactation. To facilitate the breast-feeding experience, intervention mothers were given a 20-minute audio cassette tape based on relaxation and visual imagery techniques. Among a small group of mothers whose infants were receiving mechanical ventilation, the increase in milk volume compared with that of control mothers was 121%.</s><s>The Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) branch of the Hawaii Department of Health encourages and assists mothers in breastfeeding. A study was done to determine whether an electric breast pump (vs. a manual pump) would increase breastfeeding duration in those returning to work or school full-time. During 2002-2003, a randomized trial was conducted among 280 women, with the duration of breastfeeding analyzed in 229 of these women. Descriptive analyses and a multivariate logistic regression analysis assessed factors associated with breastfeeding at 6 months. Unadjusted and adjusted survival analyses were performed to estimate the duration of breastfeeding. Particular attention should be given to examining reasons why women with greater education breastfed for a shorter duration.</s><s>The purpose of this study was to identify if special breast cleansing before breast pumping would have an affect on lowering bacterial colony counts of cultured breast milk. All other breast pumping and milk collection instructions for both groups remained the same. A student's t-test revealed a significant difference between the two groups; women who performed special breast cleansing before breast pumping had significantly lower bacterial colony counts in their cultured breast milks.</s><s>The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of a mini-electric pump (MEP) and a novel manual breast pump (MP) designed to operate more physiologically. The MP was rated significantly better overall and more comfortable and pleasant to use. Despite the greater complexity and expense of the MEP, the pumps showed similar efficacy.</s><s>The benefits of human milk for preterm infants are widely recognized, yet technological advances in milk expression have been slow. We compared the efficacy of a standard electric pump (EP; Egnell) used in 94% of United Kingdom neonatal units with a novel manual pump (MP; Avent ISIS) designed to operate more physiologically by simulating the infant's compressive action on the areola during breastfeeding. Mothers who used the EP, who frequently double pumped, showed shorter expression times but produced no more milk than mothers who used the MP. The MP was rated significantly higher than the EP on 5 major characteristics. We believe that this novel, effective MP, preferred by mothers and costing a fraction of the EP price, reflects a significant advance in milk expression for high-risk infants.breast pumps, randomized trial, preterm infants.</s><s>To develop, implement, and examine the effect of a breastfeeding educational program on breastfeeding knowledge and practices of Egyptian mothers of preterm infants. Descriptive statistics, ANOVA, Chi-square, and regression were used to analyze the data. Of the intervention group, 80% were discharged on exclusive breastfeeding compared to 40% among the control group, and breastfeeding problems were less among the intervention group. The breastfeeding educational program was effective in improving breastfeeding knowledge and practices among mothers of preterm infants.</s><s>Breast-feeding is today the major form of infant nutrition in the immediate postpartum period. Despite this, recent trends in modern life-styles have raised obstacles to successful lactation. A variety of breast pumps exist in the current US market which vary considerably in price and effectiveness. To understand better the ability of these pumps to assist women in the maintenance of lactation, the current study was undertaken to evaluate their effects on milk yield and prolactin and oxytocin release when compared to natural infant suckling. The results of this study demonstrate striking differences in the ability of breast-pumping methods to produce an acute and sustained prolactin rise in breast-feeding mothers.</s><s>Mechanical characteristics of breast pumps have been shown to influence milk extraction and hormone release in laboratory settings. However, few studies evaluate impact of differences in pump design on long-term breastfeeding success. Healthy women intending to return to work or school and to breastfeed exclusively for <or=4 months were enrolled in late pregnancy (n = 62). Prolactin response to pumping (n = 30) and changes in 24-hour milk volume during a 2-week stimulation protocol (n = 59) were measured in women randomly assigned to a novel (Embrace, Playtex, Westport, CT) or standard (Pump In Style, Medela, Baar, Switzerland) electric breast pump.</s>"

Furthermore, migration was studied during the first two postoperative years. No difference was found between the groups with respect to migration during the first two years postoperatively (p > 0.05), with the exception of subsidence of the component, which was found to be 0.0+/-0.1 millimeter (mean and standard error of the mean) for the components inserted with cement and 0.5+/-0.1 millimeter for the components inserted without cement (p < 0.01). The results of the present study emphasize the importance of the initial prosthetic fixation.</s><s>We have carried out a radiostereometric study of 50 patients (54 knees) with osteoarthritis of the knee who were randomly allocated to receive a cemented or a hydroxyapatite-coated femoral component for total knee replacement. After two years, rotation of the femoral components in the transverse, longitudinal and sagittal planes did not differ between the cemented and the hydroxyapatite-coated implants (p = 0.2 to 0.9). In total knee replacements with a rotating platform, the femoral component tended to tilt more posteriorly than in the other two designs, regardless of the choice of fixation (cemented or hydroxyapatite-coated, p = 0.04). The standard version of the femoral component, whether cemented or hydroxyapatite-coated, rotated more into valgus than was observed with the rotating-platform and FS1000 designs (p = 0.005).</s><s>The use of cement is considered as an important way to control perioperative blood loss in knee arthroplasty. We prospectively randomized 57 patients (60 knees) who underwent total knee arthroplasty with (30 knees) or without (30 knees) tibial cement to evaluate perioperative blood loss. Therefore, tibial cement does not appear to affect perioperative blood loss. This finding has implications when planning blood replacement in cementless and hybrid-type arthroplasties.</s><s>The question whether the tibial component of a total knee arthroplasty should be fixed to bone with or without bone cement has not yet been definitely answered. The first series included 86 unilateral TKRs stratified into 1 of the 3 types of fixation. After 5 years 2 knees had been revised, neither of which were due to loosening. The C-F knees rotated and migrated less than UC-F and UCHA-F knees over 5 years. Cementing of the tibial component offers more stable bone-implant contact for 5 years compared to uncemented fixation. When using uncemented components, however, there is evidence that augmenting a porous surface with hydroxyapatite may mean less motion between implant and bone after the initial postoperative year.</s><s>Fifty-three consecutive patients (57 knees; mean age, 69 years) entered a prospective randomized study to compare the fixation of hydroxyapatite (HA)-coated (29 knees) with cemented (28 knees) tibial components in the Tricon II total knee arthroplasty. The quality of the fixation during 5 years postoperatively was evaluated with radiostereometric analysis (RSA). Three HA-coated implants were revised: 2 owing to infection, and 1 owing to early delamination of the coating and clinical loosening. In the 40 patients (19 HA-coated, 21 cemented) remaining at 5 years, the magnitude of the micromotion between the HA-coated and cemented groups did not differ. Progressive radiolucent lines developed in 2 cemented knees, which both were categorized unstable.</s>"

We found no correlation between final anatomical and functional outcome, and concluded that the severity of the original soft-tissue injury and its complications are the major determinants of functional end result.</s><s>Fractures of the distal end of the radius are common injuries and are the commonest bony injury around the wrist. Management of these fractures has remained controversial as far as modality of treatment is concerned. In this study 90 adult cases of acute displaced intra-articular fractures of the lower end of the radius were classified according to Frykman's and AO classifications after obtaining radiographs in antero-posterior and lateral planes. These were randomly treated by one of three methods: (1) closed reduction and plaster immobilisation, (2) external fixation and (3) open reduction and internal fixation, and were followed for an average of 4 yr.</s><s>In a prospective 4-year study, 126 consecutive patients with a fracture of the distal radius were followed. Functional, anatomic, and radiographic final results of fixation with above-the-elbow cast immobilization were compared with the results obtained with external fixation. The results following external fixation of comminuted intraarticular fractures were better than those of similar fractures treated in a cast. Aged osteoporotic patients tolerated better residual deformities, and the clinical results had a relatively low correlation with the final anatomic alignment.</s><s>Grip strength during short and sustained maximal voluntary isometric contractions was measured in 28 females and 5 males with displaced Colles' fracture involving the distal radio-ulnar joint. The patients were randomized into two groups, treated either through immobilization with plaster cast or with external fixation. The pattern of recovery was slower for women with primary external fixation. The present findings may serve as guidance in physiotherapy for these patients.</s><s>Distal radial fractures are common, and many methods of treatment have been reported but there are no studies that compare the different treatment methods.</s><s>We performed a prospective, randomised trial on 120 patients with redisplaced fractures of the distal radius comparing four methods of treatment. The radiological results showed improvement in angulation of the distal radius for the open reduction and bone grafting group.</s><s>Eighty-five patients were reviewed 7 years after prospective randomization to bridging external fixation or plaster immobilization for treatment of a Colles' type distal radial fracture. Despite a high level of radiographic malunion (50%) overall function, range of movement and activities of daily living were not limited. Twenty-five per cent of patients had minor radiological signs of post-traumatic arthritis although only one patient was symptomatic.</s><s>This paper reports a prospective study of the treatment of Colles' fractures, either by bipolar fixation or a forearm cast. The technique of bipolar fixation proved to be safe and suitable for use in a busy district general hospital, without the necessity of elaborate equipment.</s><s>In a prospective randomized study of 47 severely displaced Colles' fractures, 23 had external fixation and 24 had a dorsal plaster cast. Five fractures in the plaster-cast group redislocated and were externally fixed at rereduction after the 11-day follow-up.</s><s>To compare closed reduction and casting with closed reduction and external fixation with optional K-wire fixation for distal radius fractures with metaphyseal displacement but without joint incongruity. Closed reduction and casting (n = 59) or closed reduction and external fixation (n = 54). Upper extremity function was measured using upper extremity MFA domain scores, overall Jebsen Taylor scores, and pinch and grip strength tests. There was a trend for better length and palmar tilt restoration with external fixation. For distal radius fractures with metaphyseal displacement but with a congruous joint, there exists a trend for better functional, clinical, and radiographic outcomes when treated by immediate external fixation and optional K-wire fixation.</s><s>In this prospective study, 70 patients between the ages of 20 and 45 years with comminuted intra-articular fractures of the distal radius of types III to VIII (graded according to Frykman) were treated either by closed reduction and forearm plaster (35 patients) or by application of a Clyburn dynamic external fixator (35 patients). The external fixator was more effective at holding the manipulated position, and the roentgenographic loss of position during fracture union was minimal compared with that seen in patients treated in plaster. Functional results in the fixator group were 18 excellent, 10 good, 6 fair, and 1 poor. The external fixator generated significantly better anatomical and functional results than did treatment with forearm plaster.</s><s>We report a prospective, randomised, controlled trial of 50 severely displaced comminuted Colles' fractures treated by either external fixation or manipulation and plaster.

Forty-five patients were randomly and prospectively divided into three groups of 15 each, depending on the surgical access employed. The percent reduction of FVC (p = 0.0170) was smaller after mini-incision cholecystectomy than after Kocher's incision cholecystectomy. There was no difference in the FEV1 (p = 0.0971) or FEF25-75% (p = 0.2058) between these two groups. FEF25-75% was significantly less impaired in the laparoscopic group than in the mini-incision group (p = 0.0327).</s><s>Cytokines are the main mediators of inflammation and the response to trauma. The purpose of this study was to compare variations in cytokine levels following laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) and mini-laparotomy cholecystectomy (OC), since these two types of operations were considered to be a unique model for examining the role of local tissue injury in postoperative inflammatory reactions. Eighteen of them underwent LC; the remaining 22 were operated on using the open technique. There was no correlation between serum CRP concentrations and the other postoperative parameters.</s><s>To evaluate the total cost of minilaparotomy cholecystectomy (MC) and laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) and perform a cost-effectiveness (CE) analysis. Patients with gallstones shown on ultrasound with normal common bile duct and no history of icterus were included after an informed consent. Cases with acute cholecystitis and raised alkaline phosphatase were excluded. The total cost of each case included cost of investigations, cost of disposable articles for operation, cost of drugs, cost of hospital stay, and cost of operation including anesthesia.</s><s>Although laparoscopic cholecystectomy has rapidly become routine practice in the UK, there has been no rigorous comparison of it with open cholecystectomy. Recovery after surgery was assessed by length of hospital stay, outpatient review at 10 days and 4 weeks, and patient questionnaires 1, 4, and 12 weeks after surgery. The hospital costs were about 400 pounds greater for the laparoscopic procedure. Laparoscopic patients were more satisfied with the appearance of their scars. Compared to minilaparotomy cholecystectomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy results in shorter hospital stay, less postoperative dysfunction, and quicker return to normal activities, but is more costly.</s><s>The aim of the study was to calculate the hospital and social costs in relation to efficacy of clinical outcome, hospital stay and time off work in two groups of patients randomly treated with laparoscopic or mini-cholecystectomy. One hundred and eighty-one patients with simple, symptomatic gallstone disease were included in the study; of these, 9 cases were excluded because of conversion to conventional cholecystectomy. Eighty-six cases underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy and 86 mini-cholecystectomy. Operative time (median time: 35 minutes) and hospital stay (median stay: 3 days) were the same for both surgical procedures. Since laparoscopic cholecystectomy is associated with a shorter period off work, it seems to be cheaper with a daily saving of 164.96 and 146.51 Euros per patient, according to cost/effectiveness and cost/utility analyses, respectively.</s><s>Three hundred and ten patients having elective cholecystectomy were randomized to either laparoscopic cholecystectomy or mini-cholecystectomy. Conversion to open cholecystectomy was significantly more common with laparoscopic cholecystectomy (13 versus 4 per cent) and complications were significantly more frequent with laparoscopic cholecystectomy (9 versus 3 per cent). If laparoscopic cholecystectomy was successful, hospital stay was significantly shorter than for mini-cholecystectomy (2 versus 3 days respectively), but overall the hospital stay was not significantly different.</s><s>To analyze outcomes after open small-incision surgery (minilaparotomy) and laparoscopic surgery for gallstone disease in general surgical practice. LC was a routine procedure at participating hospitals, whereas MC was introduced after a short training period. All nonrandomized cholecystectomies at participating units during the study period were also recorded to analyze the external validity of trial results. Of 1,705 cholecystectomies performed at participating units during the randomization period, 724 entered the trial and 362 patients were randomized to each of the procedures. The groups were well matched for age and sex, but there were fewer acute operations in the LC group than the MC group. In the LC group 264 and in the MC group 150 operations were performed by surgeons who had done more than 25 operations of that type. Median sick leave and time for return to normal recreational activities were shorter after LC than MC.</s><s>Some benefits of laparoscopic (LC) and minilaparotomy (MC) cholecystectomy may reflect attenuation of the acute phase response. C-reactive protein (CRP), alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT), retinol-binding protein (RBP), transferrin, and albumin were measured preoperatively and on postoperative days 1, 2, 4, and 7. Peak expiratory flow rate, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, and forced vital capacity were measured daily. Minimal access surgery induces an acute phase response that is less prominent after a laparoscopic technique.</s><s>Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) has gained wide acceptance for treatment of cholelithiasis in preference to open cholecystectomy, though it has not been formally compared with mini cholecystectomy (MC). 70 patients with ultrasound-proven cholelithiasis were randomly allocated LC (38) or MC (32); 37 and 25, respectively, underwent the assigned procedure. The rate of return to normal activities was 1.77 times greater in the LC group than in the MC group (95% confidence interval 1.01-3.11, p = 0.03). Although there was significant postoperative improvement in all of three quality of life scores in both groups, LC patients improved more quickly than did MC patients.</s><s>Abnormal release of inflammatory mediators following surgical injury is associated with immunological alteration, which may predispose to sepsis. We hypothesized that early recovery following laparoscopic surgery may relate to minimal impairment of immune function. There were significant increases (P < .001) in monocyte release of O2- and tumor necrosis factor, neutrophil release of O2- and chemotaxis, and white blood cell count in the open vs laparoscopic cholecystectomy study groups, with a concommitant decrease in partial arterial oxygen pressure. There were no significant differences in either plasma cortisol or C-reactive protein levels between groups. The beneficial effects of laparoscopic surgery may relate, in part, to preservation of immune function in the postoperative period.</s><s>We report a prospective randomised comparison between laparoscopic and small-incision cholecystectomy in 200 patients which was designed to eliminate bias for or against either technique. Identical wound dressings were applied in both groups so that carers could be kept blind to the type of operation.

We examined fatal injuries from trench cave-in in the construction industry for five year periods before and after the revision in the 47 US states for which data were available for both periods. The decline was somewhat greater in large business firms but was evident in construction firms of all size classes.</s><s>The Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) Integrated Management Information System (IMIS) database allows for the detailed analysis of risk factors surrounding fatal occupational events. This study used IMIS data to (1) perform a risk factor analysis of fatal construction falls, and (2) assess the impact of the February 1995 29 CFR Part 1926 Subpart M OSHA fall protection regulations for construction by calculating trends in fatal fall rates. For falls in construction, the study identified several demographic factors that may indicate increased risk. Although the study failed to show a statistically significant intervention effect from the new OSHA regulations, it may have lacked the power to do so.</s><s>There are very few published studies evaluating the impact of safety and health training on injury outcomes in the construction industry. Twenty-nine percent of workers who spent at least 1 day at the construction sites attended at least one training module. Pre-post analysis: At the end of the training program, the incidence of occupational injuries had fallen by 16% after the basic training module and by 25% following the specific modules. Time-series model: Training led to a 6% reduction in injury rates, which was not statistically significant. The training program that was implemented had a moderately positive impact on the health of workers.</s><s>Washington State enacted a change in their fall standard for the construction industry in 1991, preceding the Safety Standard for Fall Protection in the Construction Industry promulgated by Federal OSHA in 1994. There was a significant decrease in the rate of falls from height after the standard went into effect, even after adjusting for the overall decrease in work-related injuries among this cohort. The greatest decrease was seen between 3 and 3(1/2) years after the standard went into effect. There was a significant reduction in mean paid lost days per event after the standard change and there was a significant reduction in mean cost per fall when adjusting for age and the temporal trend for costs among non-fall injuries. The analyses demonstrate potential error in failing to account for temporal patterns or assuming that a decline after an intervention is related to the intervention.</s><s>Building site related accidents are so frequent and are associated with such serious consequences that they constitute a major \"health emergency\" in Italy where dangerous work conditions in the construction industry often derive from excessive financial, organisational and time pressures. After the 1997 earthquake in Umbria an extensive re-building programme led to a concentration of innumerable construction firms, sub-tendering practices and the use of poorly skilled workforces who were often employed in the black economy. To monitor construction site development, related accidents and injuries, and surveillance activity, data were collected from building site notifications on the basis of Article 11, Law 494/96, outcomes of inspections, including sanctions, and INAIL (National Insurances) certificates of work-related injuries. Construction notifications showed building sites increased in number from the 200 sites/year before the earthquake to almost 1400 per year at maximum reconstruction activity. Inspections and surveillance also increased to over 350 inspections/year in 250 sites/year. The annual incidence, a rough indicator of prevention, dropped, indicating good quality prevention strategies were in force.</s><s>To evaluate the effect of a publicly sponsored drug-free workplace program on reducing the risk of occupational injuries.

Patients in the PCS group recovered significantly faster (median 5 min vs 35 min; P < 0.0001) and left the department more quickly (median 40 min vs 75 min; P < 0.0001).</s><s>Eighty outpatients (ASA Class I or II) undergoing colonoscopy were randomized to receive either propofol or midazolam plus meperidine, administered by a nurse and supervised by an endoscopist. The mean dose of propofol administered was 218 mg; mean doses of midazolam and meperidine were, respectively, 4.7 mg and 89.7 mg. Mean time to sedation was faster in the propofol patients (2.1 min vs. 7.0 min; p < 0.0001), and depth of sedation was greater (p < 0.0001). Patients who received propofol also expressed greater overall mean satisfaction on a 10-point visual analog scale (9.3 vs. 8.6; p < 0.05).</s><s>We compared nurse-administered propofol to midazolam plus fentanyl for outpatient colonoscopy. The mean dose of propofol administered was 277 mg; mean doses of midazolam and fentanyl were 7.2 mg and 117 microg, respectively. Mean time to sedation was faster with propofol (2.1 vs. 6.1 min; P<0.0001), and depth of sedation was greater (P<0.0001). Six minor complications occurred in the propofol group: 4 episodes of hypotension, 1 episode of bradycardia, and 1 rash. Nurse-administered propofol resulted in several advantages for outpatient colonoscopy compared with midazolam plus fentanyl, but did not improve patient satisfaction.</s><s>The aim of our study was to compare the safety and efficacy of the synergistic sedation with a low dose of midazolam combined with propofol versus the standard regimen of midazolam and pethidine for conscious sedation in colonoscopy in a group of patients that included a sufficient number of elderly patients with several comorbidities. a median dose of 5 mg of midazolam (range 3-7) and 75 mg of pethidine (range 50-125). The patient's comfort level was assessed by a 4-point scale 24 h after the procedure. The time to recover from sedation was assessed at 5, 10, and 30 min after the procedure by using the Aldrete score. Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that among sex, age, duration of the test, American Society of Anesthesiologists' Physical Status Classification grade, and the sort of sedation, the synergistic sedation with midazolam and propofol was the only factor associated with a higher level of patient comfort (chi2 = 5.5, p < 0.05).</s><s>Patient-controlled sedation (PCS) enables titration of dosage to an individual's requirements and is potentially useful in colonoscopy. The aim was to compare the value of patient-controlled sedation, using propofol and alfentanil, with that of intravenous diazemuls and pethidine during colonoscopy. Patient-controlled sedation is an effective alternative to premedication with narcotic/benzodiazepine combinations during colonoscopy.</s><s>The quality of the anaesthesia and of the recovery (appreciated by Newman's test) of two anesthetic technics for colonoscopies are compared on two homogeneous groups from 50 patients each: propofol alone versus midazolam-alfentanyl association. The differences registered during anaesthesia, particularly concerning the breathing depression might be attributed to alfentanyl which has been used often at important doses. The use's safety and the fast recovery with propofol incite to advocate it as an unique+ anaesthetic agent for colonoscopies.</s><s>We conducted an open, prospective, randomized study to compare the efficacy, safety and recovery characteristics of remifentanil or propofol during monitored anaesthesia care in patients undergoing colonoscopy. Recovery of cognitive and psychomotor functions was faster in the remifentanil group. Emergence times were shorter and the recovery of cognitive function was faster with remifentanil compared with propofol. Remifentanil provided a smoother haemodynamic profile than propofol; however, the frequent occurrence of remifentanil-induced hypoventilation requires the cautious administration of this agent.</s><s>Nurse-administered propofol sedation (NAPS) and patient-controlled sedation using patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pumps are gaining increasing popularity for gastrointestinal endoscopy. For NAPS, following intravenous loading of 0.8 mg/kg propofol, mixtures of 14.3 mg propofol and 35 microgram alfentanil were titrated by nurses using a PCA pump. Adequacy of sedation was measured by the Observer's Scale for Sedation and Alertness (OSSA) score (range 1-5). Between July 2005 and June 2006, 88 patients were randomly allocated to NAPS and 90 to DPS. Drugs cost for NAPS was higher than for DPS (Hong Kong dollars [HKD] 98.34 vs. 5.01).</s><s>[Propofol narcosis for endoscopy--more dangerous than midazolam?].</s><s>This prospective, randomized trial was designed to test the hypothesis that continuous infusion of low-dose remifentanil can provide effective analgesia, sedation, amnesia, patient comfort and stable recovery profile without respiratory depression when compared with propofol infusion during colonoscopy. One hundred patients were randomly assigned to receive either remifentanil (group R, 0.5 microg/kg followed by 0.05 microg/kg/min, n = 50) or propofol (group P, 0.5 mg/kg followed by 50 microg/kg/min, n = 50). Supplemental doses of remifentanil 12.5 microg in group R and propofol 10 mg in group P were given to treat complaints of moderate to severe pain and discomfort. Hemodynamic and respiratory data, pain, discomfort and sedation scores, patient and gastroenterologist satisfaction and recovery profiles were recorded. After bolus injection of the study drugs, the respiratory rate and oxygen saturation values were lower in group R than in group P. Only one patient in group R required airway support. Low-dose remifentanil infusion with intermittent bolus injections can provide adequate sedation, amnesia and better analgesia than propofol infusion during colonoscopy.</s><s>Patients undergoing colonoscopy are often sedated with benzodiazepines and long-acting opiates. Patients in group I (n = 32) received a median dose of 9 mg midazolam (interquartile range [IQR] 6 to 12); 20 patients (59%) needed additional nalbuphine (median 20 mg, IQR 10 to 20). Patients in group II (n = 47) received 2 mg midazolam and repeated injections of propofol (median 100 mg, IQR 53 to 145) with a maximal bolus of 50 mg. Patients treated with the synergistic sedation (group II) recovered remarkably sooner after the procedure compared with those in group I, with a median time to discharge of 17 minutes vs. 93 minutes (P<0.001). Low-dose midazolam combined with propofol is an effective and economic alternative to benzodiazepine-based analgosedation. It is associated with a high degree of patient comfort and rapid recovery times, and has a potential cost benefit concerning nursing care and bed facilities.</s>"

Seventy-four healthy participants (43 women) were randomized in a double-blind, placebo-controlled manner to 1 of 4 groups: alvimopan 12 mg twice daily in the presence and absence of codeine sulfate 30 mg 4 times/day, or codeine or placebo alone. The primary end points for colonic transit were geometric center of the colonic counts at 24 hours and time for 50% ascending colon emptying. Codeine delayed gastric, small-bowel, proximal, and overall colonic transit (P < .05). Thus, the mean colonic geometric center at 24 hours was 2.33 with placebo/placebo, 3.25 with alvimopan/placebo (P < .05), 1.5 with placebo/codeine (P < .05), and 2.63 with alvimopan/codeine. Alvimopan reverses codeine's inhibitory effect on small-bowel and colon transit and has potential for treatment of opiate bowel dysfunction.</s><s>Alvimopan is a peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor (PAM-OR) antagonist for accelerating gastrointestinal recovery after surgery. The primary efficacy endpoint was time to gastrointestinal (GI) recovery (measured by toleration of solid food and passage of flatus/stool; GI-3). Secondary endpoints included time to GI-2 recovery (toleration of solid food and passage of stool) and hospital discharge order written (DCO). Alvimopan did not significantly accelerate GI-3 compared with placebo [6 mg: hazard ratio (HR) = 1.20, p = 0.080; 12 mg: HR = 1.24, p = 0.038). Alvimopan (6 or 12 mg) accelerates GI recovery and is well tolerated in patients undergoing open laparotomy.</s><s>Constipation is a common side-effect of opioid therapy; in addition to their analgesic effect, opioids reduce intestinal secretion and motility with an increase in whole-gut transit time. Naloxone, a specific opioid antagonist, reverses these effects but may also cause symptoms of opioid withdrawal in patients on long-term therapy. Whole-gut transit time was calculated and compared for each treatment period. Urgency to defecate was reported by two volunteers on naloxone alone and by three on combination therapy.</s><s>Methylnaltrexone is a quaternary opioid antagonist with limited ability to cross the blood-brain barrier that has the potential to antagonize the peripherally mediated gastrointestinal effects of opioids. Morphine significantly increased oral-cecal transit time from 114.6 +/- 37.0 minutes (mean +/- SD) to 158.6 +/- 50.2 minutes (p < 0.001). These sessions were then followed by single-blind evaluations of descending doses of methylnaltrexone. We observed that 6.4 mg/kg oral methylnaltrexone significantly attenuated the morphine-induced delay in oral-cecal transit time (p < 0.005 compared with morphine alone), and a dose-dependent response was obtained.</s><s>Reversal of narcotic-induced delay in gastric emptying and paracetamol absorption by naloxone.</s><s>A dose-ranging study of the use of oral naloxone in opioid-related constipation in patients with far-advanced cancer is reported. Naloxone doses were calculated as a percentage of the morphine dose each patient was receiving. Seventeen patients entered the first phase of the study, which had a randomised, double-blind design. Outcome measures were small bowel transit time (SBTT) measured by the lactulose/hydrogen breath test, pain scores and the occurrence of adverse events. No significant difference between placebo and naloxone occurred in the 14 remaining patients receiving total daily doses of naloxone 10% or less of the 24 h dose of morphine. Phase two of the study had an open design, in which laxative effects were determined clinically. Naloxone at a maximum dose level of 20% was given to seven patients, up to 40% to two patients and up to 80% to one patient.</s><s>Methylnaltrexone is a quaternary opioid antagonist with limited ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and the potential to antagonize the peripherally mediated effects of opioids. Twelve healthy volunteers were given intravenous placebo, placebo plus 0.05 mg/kg morphine, or 0.45 mg/kg methylnaltrexone plus 0.05 mg/kg morphine. Morphine significantly increased oral-cecal transit time from 104.6 +/- 31.1 minutes (mean +/- SD) to 163.3 +/- 39.8 minutes (p < 0.01). At a higher dose of morphine (0.1 mg/kg), our preliminary results indicated that 0.45 mg/kg methylnaltrexone also prevented the morphine-induced delay in oral-cecal transit time, with no effect on analgesia.</s><s>The purpose of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of alvimopan, a novel peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonist, in patients who undergo simple total abdominal hysterectomy. Adverse events were monitored up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug was administered. Alvimopan significantly accelerated the time to first bowel movement (hazard ratio, 2.33; P <.001). Alvimopan has a safety profile that is similar to that of placebo and provides significantly improved lower gastrointestinal recovery in women who undergo simple total abdominal hysterectomy.</s><s>Alvimopan has been shown to reverse the inhibitory effect of opioids on gastrointestinal transit without affecting analgesia. Averaged over the 21-day treatment period, 54%, 43%, and 29% of patients had a BM within 8 hours after alvimopan 1 mg, 0.5 mg, or placebo, respectively (P < .001). Secondary outcomes of median times to first BM were 3, 7, and 21 hours after initial doses of 1 mg, 0.5 mg, and placebo, respectively (P < .001; 1 mg vs placebo). Treatment-emergent adverse events were primarily bowel-related, occurred during the first week of treatment, and were of mild to moderate severity. Alvimopan was generally well tolerated and did not antagonize opioid analgesia. Patients treated with chronic opioid therapy often experience opioid-induced bowel dysfunction as a result of undesirable effects on peripheral opioid receptors located in the gastrointestinal tract.</s><s>Little is known about the effects of mixed opioid analgesics on gastrointestinal propulsion. For comparison, another group of patients (n = 20) undergoing similar interventions received placebo (0.9% NaCl) at the end of the procedure. Pain estimation by visual analogue scale (VAS 0-10) suggested an antagonistic effect at the 10th and 20th min postoperatively, as pain scores in the nalbuphine group were higher when compared to placebo (3.5 vs 1.8 and 2.5 vs 1.4). When given after potent opioids, it must be borne in mind that the antagonistic effect of nalbuphine is initially apparent. The agonistic potency of the compound will come into effect around the 30th min post-injection. Delayed gastrointestinal transit after nalbuphine is explained by agonist-like effects on peripheral opioid receptors in the gut.</s><s>Postoperative ileus presents significant clinical challenges that potentially prolong hospital stay, contribute to readmission, and increase morbidity. Patients undergoing partial colectomy or simple or radical hysterectomy were randomized to receive alvimopan 6 mg (n = 152), alvimopan 12 mg (n = 146), or placebo (n = 153) orally 2 hours before surgery and twice daily thereafter until discharge or for up to seven days. Mean time to the hospital discharge order written was significantly accelerated in patients treated with alvimopan 6 mg (hazard ratio = 1.50; P < 0.001). In patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, alvimopan accelerated gastrointestinal recovery and time to the hospital discharge order written compared with placebo and was well tolerated.</s><s>Constipation is the most common chronic adverse effect of opioid pain medications in patients who require long-term opioid administration, such as patients with advanced cancer, but conventional measures for ameliorating constipation often are insufficient. Twenty-two subjects (9 men and 13 women; mean [SD] age, 43.2 [5.5] years) enrolled in a methadone maintenance program and having methadone-induced constipation. Laxation response, oral-cecal transit time, and central opioid withdrawal symptoms were compared between the 2 groups. The 11 subjects in the placebo group showed no laxation response, and all 11 subjects in the intervention group had laxation response after intravenous methylnaltrexone administration (P<.001). Low-dosage methylnaltrexone may have clinical utility in managing opioid-induced constipation.</s><s>It has the potential to prevent or reverse the peripherally mediated gastrointestinal effects of opioids. Subsequently, in the controlled study with another nine subjects, the transit time increased after intravenous morphine administration in all nine subjects, and the lower dose (3.2 mg/kg) of enteric-coated methylnaltrexone completely prevented the morphine-induced change in oral-cecal transit time in all nine subjects. Morphine significantly increased oral-cecal transit time from baseline level of 96.7 +/- 54.1 minutes (mean +/- SD) to 155.0 +/- 53.6 minutes (P = .014). Plasma concentrations after 6.4 mg/kg and 3.2 mg/kg enteric-coated methylnaltrexone were substantially lower compared with those after 6.4 mg/kg of the uncoated formulation.</s><s>Enteral administration of naloxone theoretically allows selective blocking of intestinal opioid receptors caused by extensive presystemic metabolism. Therefore, we studied the effect of enteral naloxone on the amount of gastric tube reflux, the frequency of pneumonia, and the time until first defecation in mechanically ventilated patients with fentanyl analgesia. Eighty-four mechanically ventilated, fentanyl-treated patients without gastrointestinal surgery or diseases. In both groups, time until first defecation, ventilation time, and length of intensive care unit stay did not differ. There was no difference in fentanyl requirements between the naloxone and the placebo group (7 vs. 6.5 microg/kg/hr, p =.15).</s><s>ADL-8-2698 is a novel peripherally restricted opioid antagonist that may selectively prevent opioid-induced gastrointestinal effects without reversing analgesia. Morphine prolonged gastrointestinal transit time from 69 to 103 minutes (P = .005); this was prevented by ADL 8-2698 (P = .004). Postoperatively, 45 patients were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to receive ADL 8-2698 (4 mg) or placebo and intravenous morphine (0.15 mg/kg) or to receive oral and intravenous placebo.</s><s>Gastrtis and esophagitis are frequent and severe complications in intensive care patients, mainly caused by increased duodenogastral reflux. Therefore, in a subpopulation of these patients we studied the effect of enteral naloxone on the incidence of mucosal injury in opioid-treated, mechanically ventilated patients. Frequency of gastritis and esophagitis was quantified according to the Savary-Miller Score, and further parameter of GI motility (frequency of propulsive medication, amount of enteral feeding) were measured. In four of seventeen patients of the naloxone group (24 %) and 14 of 22 patients of the placebo group (64 %; p = 0.02), esophageal or gastral mucosal injuries were detected. Volume of enteral feeding showed an increasing trend in the second half of the study.</s><s>It is often difficult to treat and is believed to be primarily a peripheral effect. Patients taking stable doses of opioids with complaints of constipation were recruited for this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Patients were given 4 mg or 2 mg of oral naloxone, or placebo, three times daily. All the patients who received oral naloxone had some improvement in their bowel frequency. Patients using high doses of opioids appear to be the most vulnerable to the analgesic effect of oral naloxone.</s><s>Methylnaltrexone, the first peripheral opioid receptor antagonist, has the potential to prevent or reverse opioid-induced peripherally mediated side effects without affecting analgesia. In previous human trials, we demonstrated that intravenous methylnaltrexone prevented morphine-induced delay in gastrointestinal transit time. We also observed that the compound decreased some of the morphine-induced troublesome subjective effects. However, the effects of subcutaneous methylnaltrexone, a more convenient route of administration, have not been evaluated. In addition, opioid-induced unpleasant subjective effects and pharmacokinetics were studied. We observed that in the first group (n = 6) morphine (0.05 mg/kg intravenously) increased the transit time from a baseline level of 85 +/- 20.5 min to 155 +/- 27.9 min (mean +/- S.D., P < 0.01).</s><s>To demonstrate that alvimopan (6 or 12 mg) accelerates recovery of gastrointestinal (GI) function in patients undergoing laparotomy for bowel resection or radical hysterectomy. Postoperative ileus (POI) following laparotomy may increase morbidity and extend hospitalization. Alvimopan is a novel opioid receptor antagonist in development for the management of POI. A total of 510 patients scheduled for bowel resection or radical hysterectomy were randomized (1:1:1) to receive alvimopan 6 mg, alvimopan 12 mg, or placebo orally > or =2 hours before surgery, then twice a day (b.i.d.) The primary efficacy end point was a composite of time to recovery of upper and lower GI function.</s><s>Epidural morphine is associated with decreased bowel motility and increased transit time. Low doses of intravenous naloxone reduce morphine-induced pruritus without reversing analgesia, but the effect of epidural naloxone on bowel motility has not been studied. We measured the time to the first postoperative passage of flatus and feces to evaluate the restoration of bowel function, and visual analog scales (VAS) for pain during rest and movement. No differences were found in either resting or active VAS between the two groups. Epidural naloxone reduces epidural morphine-induced intestinal hypomotility without reversing its analgesic effects.</s><s>Postoperative recovery of gastrointestinal function and resumption of oral intake are critical determinants of the length of hospital stay. Fifteen patients underwent partial colectomy and 63 underwent total abdominal hysterectomy. Patients given 6 mg of ADL 8-2698 had significantly faster recovery of gastrointestinal function than those given placebo. Selective inhibition of gastrointestinal opioid receptors by an antagonist with limited oral absorption that does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier speeds recovery of bowel function and shortens the duration of hospitalization.</s><s>Opioids delay gastric emptying, which in turn may increase the risk of vomiting and pulmonary aspiration. The importance of peripheral opioid receptor antagonism in modulating opioid-induced delay in gastric emptying was evaluated using methylnaltrexone, a quaternary derivative of the opiate antagonist naltrexone, which does not cross the blood-brain barrier. In a randomized, double-blind, crossover placebo-controlled study, 11 healthy volunteers were given either placebo (saline), 0.09 mg/kg morphine, or 0.09 mg/kg morphine plus 0.3 mg/kg methylnaltrexone on three separate occasions before ingesting 500 ml deionized water. The rate of gastric emptying was measured by two methods: a noninvasive epigastric bioimpedance technique and the acetaminophen absorption test. The mean +/- SD time taken for the gastric volume to decrease to 50% (t0.5) after placebo was 5.5 +/- 2.1 min. Maximum concentrations and area under the concentration curve from 0 to 90 min of serum acetaminophen concentrations after morphine were significantly different from placebo and morphine administered concomitantly with methylnaltrexone (P < 0.05).</s>"

Secondary analyses did not reveal any significant differences on any other measures.</s><s>Previous studies suggest a potential benefit from nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Prescribing NSAIDs, however, carries the risk of significant gastrointestinal adverse events. There were no group differences with any of the outcome measures in an intent-to-treat analysis. This pilot study, with small treatment numbers, did not demonstrate a significant effect of NSAID treatment in AD, but the trends observed justify further investigations with a larger number of participants.</s><s>Epidemiological studies have examined the association between the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This was a 12-month multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial. Participants with mild-moderate AD (Mini-Mental State Examination score >15, <26; Clinical Dementia Rating= 0.5-1), 65 years or older, with reliable caregivers, were recruited between April 2003 and September 2004. Seven AD Outpatient Treatment Centers screened 530 patients, 132 of whom were enrolled. Secondary measures included changes in MMSE, CDR, Basic and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scales, and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Fifty-one patients (77%) in the ibuprofen vs 46 (70%) in the placebo group completed the protocol (p>0.20). In a subsample of genotyped patients, ApoE epsilon4 carriers treated with ibuprofen (n=27) were the only group without significant cognitive decline.</s><s>In a 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 100 to 150 mg/d indomethacin appeared to protect mild to moderately impaired Alzheimer's disease patients from the degree of cognitive decline exhibited by a well-matched, placebo-treated group.</s><s>The objective of this study was to determine whether treatment with the nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) indomethacin slows cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted between May 2000 and September 2005 in two hospitals in the Netherlands. The primary outcome measure was the change from baseline after one year of treatment on the cognitive subscale of the AD Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog). Considerable recruitment problems of participants were encountered, leading to an underpowered study. This difference (1.5 points; CI -4.5-7.5) was not statistically significant, and neither were any of the secondary outcome measures.</s><s>Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) may play an important role in the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The efficacy and safety of celecoxib (200 mg bid), a COX-2 selective inhibitor, were assessed in patients > or =50 years with established mild-to-moderate AD to determine whether treatment was effective in retarding deterioration of cognitive function. This was a 52-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Two extension studies were conducted but were terminated early based on these efficacy results. Safety data from all 3 studies indicated that celecoxib was generally well-tolerated.</s><s>Laboratory and epidemiologic studies suggest that anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressive therapy may be useful in the treatment of AD. The active treatment regimen consisted of an initial dose of 20 mg of prednisone daily for 4 weeks tapered to a maintenance dose of 10 mg daily for 1 year, followed by gradual withdrawal during an additional 16 weeks. There was no difference in cognitive decline between the prednisone and placebo treatment groups in the primary intent-to-treat analysis, or in a secondary analysis considering completers only. Subjects treated with prednisone showed behavioral decline compared with those in the placebo group.</s>"

Sixty-two patients were not relieved by conservative nonsurgical therapy and were treated by arthroscopy or arthrocentesis. In both groups the differences in functional result and in pain control were analysed.</s><s>Various types of treatment have been proposed for patients with temporomandibular joint (TMJ) osteoarthrosis and internal derangement. Patients treated with arthroscopic surgery reported more pain relief and more improvement of mobility than patients treated non-surgically, although clinical assessment results were comparable between the two groups. The results of this pilot study indicate that the assessment methods are sufficiently sensitive for changes in pain, mobility, and functional ability. It is concluded that the preliminary results should be verified in a larger trial with a slightly adjusted design.</s><s>A prospective, randomized study was undertaken to compare arthroscopy and arthrocentesis for treatment of temporomandibular joint disorders. Nineteen patients with clinical and radiographic documentation of internal derangement of the temporomandibular joint(s) unresponsive to nonsurgical therapy were randomized to one of two surgical groups: arthroscopic lysis and lavage under general anesthesia or arthrocentesis, hydraulic distention, and lavage under intravenous sedation. There was no statistically significant difference in outcome between the two groups for any parameter evaluated. Categorization of a particular subject into a successful outcome was based on statistically significant improvement in maximum incisal opening and pain scores; the overall success rate was 82% for arthroscopy and 75% for arthrocentesis.</s><s>The study compared the efficacy of discectomy or arthroscopic lysis and lavage in patients with chronic closed lock of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) in a prospective, randomized clinical trial. Twenty-two patients with a clinical diagnosis of chronic closed lock were prospectively randomized to either discectomy or arthroscopic lysis and lavage. The clinical evaluation included measurement of maximum interincisal opening and protrusion, recording of clicking and crepitation, and palpation for tenderness of the TMJ and jaw muscles. Recordings were made before the operation (baseline) and at the 1-year follow-up. Discectomy reduced pain somewhat more effectively than arthroscopic lysis and lavage. Considering that arthroscopic lysis and lavage is a minimally invasive outpatient procedure, it should be used as the first choice in surgical treatment of this condition.</s><s>The article shows the 1-yr results comparing the efficacy of open-surgery high condylectomy and disc repositioning and the arthroscopic procedure of lysis, lavage and capsular stretch in patients with chronic closed lock of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). Twenty patients with a clinical and radiologic diagnosis of chronic closed lock were randomly chosen to be treated with either open surgery or arthroscopy. Both open surgery and arthroscopic surgery reduced pain and improved mandibular function. The clinical examination showed similar good results for the 2 surgical procedures. At 1-yr follow-up, clicking was the same as before surgical procedures; no patient in the open group showed crepitation, but crepitation was found in patients in the arthroscopy group. Because of the minimally invasive character of the arthroscopic procedure, it should be considered as the first choice in the surgical treatment of the TMJ.</s><s>For individuals with temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disc displacement without reduction with limited mouth opening (closed lock), interventions vary from minimal treatment to surgery. In a single-blind trial, 106 individuals with TMJ closed lock were randomized among medical management, rehabilitation, arthroscopic surgery with post-operative rehabilitation, or arthroplasty with post-operative rehabilitation. Using an intention-to-treat analysis, we observed no between-group difference at any follow-up for CMI (p > or = 0.33) or SSI (p > or = 0.08).</s><s>We have compared two techniques of arthroscopic surgery for advanced internal derangement of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). One group had arthroscopic lysis and lavage (ALL) and the other had ALL plus arthroscopic anterolateral capsular release (AALCR). All patients were assessed preoperatively, and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Thirty-five patients (41 joints) had ALL and 66 patients (73 joints) had AALCR. Both groups had significantly less pain in the joint and better jaw opening one year postoperatively.</s>"

BLM was administered intra-arterially in 42 patients, intravenously in 22 patients and intramuscularly in 20 patients. The corresponding recurrence-free rates and five-year survival rates were 71.8% and 17%, and 65.5 and 23.5% respectively.</s><s>To determine if adjuvant methotrexate (MTX), escalated weekly to toxicity, could improve disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival by preventing recurrent disease, 60 patients with potentially resectable stage III or IV squamous head and neck carcinomas were stratified by primary site, stage, and nutritional status, then randomized by pairs to receive or not receive adjuvant MTX. There were no statistically significant imbalances in known prognostic factors between the two treatment arms. MTX was begun at 40 mg/m2 and escalated 10 mg/m2 weekly (four doses preoperatively; four doses postoperatively, preradiation therapy; eight doses postradiation therapy) to mucosal or hematologic toxicity. Thirty-two patients died (median survival, 19 months); 23 patients are alive with median follow-up of 43 months.

Three hundred eighty-four stage III (6%) and IV (94%) oropharyngeal (59.4%), hypopharyngeal (32.3%), and oral cavity (8.3%) cancer patients were randomly assigned to receive either 30 Gy (2 Gy every day) followed by 1.4 Gy bid to a total of 70.6 Gy concurrently with FU (600 mg/m(2), 120 hours continuous infusion) days 1 through 5 and MMC (10 mg/m(2)) on days 5 and 36 (C-HART) or 14 Gy (2 Gy every day) followed by 1.4 Gy bid to a total dose of 77.6 Gy (HART). At 5 years, the locoregional control and overall survival rates were 49.9% and 28.6% for C-HART versus 37.4% and 23.7% for HART, respectively (P = .001 and P = .023, respectively). C-HART (70.6 Gy) is superior to dose-escalated HART (77.6 Gy) with comparable or less acute reactions and equivalent late reactions, indicating an improvement of the therapeutic ratio.</s><s>From April 1987 to October 1992, 67 patients with inoperable squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck region were included in a randomized trial. The followup for living patients was 14 to 60 months with a median of 42 months. Analysis of preliminary results has shown that: 1) early and late side effects are similar in both groups; 2) after completion of treatment, the percentage of patients in complete remission was 71% (20/28) in the experimental group and 43% (12/28) in the control group; this difference was statistically significant among non responders to induction chemotherapy (1/15 versus 13/20, P = 0.001), but non significant among responders (11/13 versus 7/8) and 3) there were no differences between both randomized groups in term of 3-year overall survival and of 3-year loco-regional control.</s><s>136 patients with previously untreated stage III or IV squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck entered a prospective randomized trial to compare the efficacy and toxicity of DDP vs DDP-VP 16 213 (Etoposide). Objective response rate appeared to be low in both groups: in group A (60 evaluated patients) CR = 1, PR = 9; CR + PR = 14.5%, and in group B (57 evaluated patients) CR = 3, PR = 8; CR + PR = 16.4% (p greater than 0.4).</s><s>From January 1981 through December 1983, 49 untreated patients with locally advanced head and neck cancers were randomized in two groups to receive different radiochemotherapy regimens. Group A, including 29 cases, received 4 cycles of induction chemotherapy with Bleomycin, Methotrexate and Hydroxyurea before definitive external radiotherapy (60 Gy); group B, including 20 patients, received the same total dose of radiotherapy but the 4 cycles of chemotherapy, as described above, were administered between the 20- and the 40-Gy doses. Both groups were compared with a control group treated in the same period with radiotherapy (60 Gy) alone.</s><s>Single-modality radiotherapy is still considered standard treatment for patients with locally advanced unresectable cancer of the head and neck. As treatment outcome is poor, attempts to integrate chemotherapy into the overall management of these patients are ongoing. A randomized study was undertaken to compare a sequential with a simultaneous chemoradiotherapy program. Between February 1986 and February 1991, 93 eligible patients with locally advanced unresectable cancer of the head and neck were stratified by WHO PS, T and N class and primary site and then randomized to receive either three courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin (100 mg/m2 i.v. A better compliance was associated with the concomitant treatment, with 87% of the patients completing the entire radiotherapy program versus 63% of those in the sequential arm (p = 0.01). Phase III studies are needed in order to establish the superiority of this combination of cisplatin and radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone.</s><s>Single agent mitomycin c (MMC) has been shown to improve the outcome of radiotherapy in single institution trials. In order to confirm these findings in a broader worldwide setting, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) initiated a multicentre trial randomising between radiotherapy alone versus radiotherapy plus MMC. Stratification parameters were tumour localization, T-stage, N-stage, and institution. A total of 558 patients were recruited in the trial from February 1996 to December 1999. Patients had stage III (n=223) or stage IV (n=255) squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity (n=230), oropharynx (n=140), hypopharynx (n=65) or larynx (n=43). Prognostic factors like age, gender, site, size, differentiation and stage were well balanced between the two arms. There was no significant effect of MMC on locoregional control or survival, except for the 161 N0 patients, where MMC resulted in a better loco-regional control (3-year estimate 16% vs. 29%, P=0.01).</s><s>Intra-arterial methotrexate chemotherapy and telecobalt therapy in cancer of the oral cavity and oropharynx.</s><s>With the aim of reducing the side-effects in the surrounding healthy tissues, and/or improving the local control rate, radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy has been used to treat carcinoma of the esophagus, of the tongue, and of the paranasal sinuses. In the treatment of esophageal cancer, a dose of bleomycin too small to demonstrate clinical activity on its own is shown to potentiate the action of radiation with an enhancement ratio lying between 1.3 and 1.7 (Table 1). From the concept of 'therapeutic ratio' a 'two-phase' treatment modality (Table 2) was proposed, because many anticancer drugs or radiosensitizers available today influence not only the tumor tissue but also the surrounding healthy tissues.</s><s>Treatment results of irradiation as a single treatment for advanced stage IV unresectable head and neck cancer remains uniformly poor and apparently has not changed with the most recent improvements in oncological care. The present study was designed to determine the feasibility, potential risks and benefits of the two methods of combined treatment and radiotherapy alone on the management of advanced unresectable squamous cell carcinoma of the upper respiratory and digestive system. Thirty patients were randomized to each study group: radiotherapy alone (70 Gy); neoadjuvant chemotherapy (vinblastine, mitomycin, cisplatin, and bleomycin) and radiotherapy; concomitant chemotherapy (cisplatin and bleomycin) and radiotherapy. An increased frequency of complete responses (33%) was seen in patients treated with the two different combinations of chemotherapy and irradiation compared to irradiation alone (10%).</s><s>The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on the survival of patients with oropharyngeal cancer. The loco-regional treatment consisted either of surgery plus plus radiotherapy or of radiotherapy alone. infusion of fluorouracil (1000 mg/m2/day) for 5 days were delivered every 21 days. The effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on event-free survival was smaller and of borderline significance (P = 0.11). Stratification of the results on the type of local treatment, surgery plus radiotherapy or radiotherapy alone, did not reveal any heterogeneity in the effect of chemotherapy.</s><s>Ninety-six patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were randomized to treatment with intravenous methotrexate followed by radical irradiation or radiotherapy alone.</s><s>Three regimes of combined treatment for intraoral and oropharyngeal cancer were compared. In group A, cisplatin 6 mg/m2 was given intravenously, daily; group B--40 mg/m2, weekly; group C--100 mg/m2, once in 3 weeks. Among relatively frequent side-effects were granulocytopenia, asthenia and stomatitis. Overall immediate effectiveness was: group A--100%, group B--96% and group C--100%.</s><s>To investigate whether the addition of cisplatin (CDDP) to hyperfractionation (Hfx) radiation therapy (RT) offers an advantage over the same Hfx RT given alone in locally advanced (stages III and IV) squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. One hundred thirty patients were randomized to receive either Hfx RT alone to a tumor dose of 77 Gy in 70 fractions in 35 treatment days over 7 weeks (group I, n = 65) or the same Hfx RT and concurrent low-dose (6 mg/m(2)) daily CDDP (group II, n = 65). Hfx RT/chemotherapy offered significantly higher survival rates than Hfx RT alone (68% v 49% at 2 years and 46% v 25% at 5 years; P =.0075). However, there was no difference between the two treatment groups in the incidence of either acute or late high-grade RT-induced toxicity.</s><s>To define further the role of concurrent chemoradiotherapy for patients with advanced squamous carcinoma of the head and neck. The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group developed this three-arm randomized phase II trial. Patients on arm 1 were to receive cisplatin 10 mg/m(2) daily and fluorouracil (FU) 400 mg/m(2) continuous infusion (CI) daily for the final 10 days of treatment. Patients randomly assigned to arms 1 and 3 were to receive their treatments every week; patients on arm 2 were to receive their therapy every other week. Between 1997 and 1999, 241 patients were entered onto study; 231 were analyzable. Fewer than 10% of patients had unacceptable deviations or incomplete chemotherapy in the three arms.</s><s>To determine whether the addition of infusional fluorouracil (I-FU) to standard radiotherapy improves survival at acceptable toxicity in patients with locally advanced squamous cell head and neck cancer (SCHNC). Those in the experimental arm received I-FU 1.2 g/m2/d, as a 72-hour infusion in the first and third weeks of radiation. One hundred seventy-five patients were randomized (88 to I-FU and 87 to placebo), and the treatment arms were well balanced. Toxicity was greater in I-FU patients, but did not interfere with the scheduled delivery or completion of radiation.</s><s>Long-term follow-up for patients who receive chemoradiation for head and neck cancer is lacking from most studies reported in the literature. However, in those with oropharyngeal cancer, both primary control and survival were significantly improved when chemotherapy was used. The other most significant benefit from chemoradiation is the much lower rate of salvage operations for primary recurrence. The addition of methotrexate failed to show any effect on the development of metastatic neck nodes. The timing of the methotrexate with radiotherapy has a significant influence on primary control and survival in head and neck cancer.</s><s>To evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with advanced head and neck squamous cancer, the Head and Neck Contracts Program conducted a three-arm study comparing standard surgery and radiation, induction chemotherapy (cisplatin and bleomycin) plus standard therapy, and induction chemotherapy plus standard therapy followed by maintenance cisplatin for 6 months. For hypopharyngeal and laryngeal cancers there was no marked overall benefit. For the 106 patients with T1 plus T2 disease, there was marginal improvement in disease-free survival for the maintenance group (72%) compared with the standard group (47%) or induction group (43%) (overall P = .09). There was superior disease-free survival for patients with N1 disease on the maintenance arm (70%) compared with the standard arm (42%) (P = .024). A significant survival advantage with maintenance chemotherapy was only seen for N2 disease (overall P = .04). Since head and neck cancer patients are a heterogeneous group, there may be particular sites and stages for which adjuvant chemotherapy would be advantageous, and subset analysis can help indicate directions for new trials.</s><s>In a prospective, randomized, multicenter study, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (CT) with carboplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) followed by locoregional treatment (LRT) was compared with locoregional treatment alone in the treatment of patients with head and neck cancer. This study, which includes 324 patients, was conducted from January 1988 to July 1991. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the carboplatin/5-FU regimen both on the incidence of mutilating surgery and on the survival rate. Patients with a complete tumor response then received radiotherapy alone, instead of the treatment planned initially. Three hundred patients were analyzed: 79 had tumors of the oral cavity, 106 oropharyngeal tumors, and 115 pharyngolaryngeal tumors. The tumor objective response rate was 63% and complete response rate was 31% (35% for oropharyngeal, 34% for pharyngolaryngeal tumors, 22.5% for oral cavity tumors), which led to a 29% decrease in the rate of mutilating surgery. There was no significant difference between survival curves in the CT+LRT and LRT groups. At 4 years, overall survival rates were 56 and 46%; disease-free survival rates were 33 and 30% in the CT+LRT and the LRT groups, respectively.</s><s>To determine whether the application of two courses of cisplatin simultaneously with hyperfractionated radiotherapy improves the outcome in locally advanced and/or node-positive nonmetastatic carcinomas of the head and neck, compared with hyperfractionated radiotherapy alone. From July 1994 to July 2000, 224 patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (excluding nasopharynx and paranasal sinus) were randomly assigned to hyperfractionated radiotherapy (median dose, 74.4 Gy; 1.2 Gy twice daily) or the same radiotherapy combined with two cycles of concomitant cisplatin (20 mg/m2 on 5 days of weeks 1 and 5). The primary end point was time to any treatment failure; secondary end points were locoregional failure, metastatic relapse, overall survival, and late toxicity. Locoregional control and distant disease-free survival were significantly improved with cisplatin (log-rank test, P = .039 and .011, respectively). The therapeutic index of hyperfractionated radiotherapy is improved by concomitant cisplatin.</s><s>In 1986 a prospective, randomized, multi-centre trial for evaluation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in the treatment of advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck was initiated. As survival in this group of patients is poor the purpose was to find a possible survival benefit of the chemotherapy in addition to radiotherapy compared to radiotherapy only. Four-hundred sixty-one patients from Denmark, Norway and Sweden with tumors in oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx and larynx were randomized to receive either standard treatment (radiotherapy or radiotherapy followed by surgery) or neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by standard treatment. infusion on day 1 followed by 5-fluorouracil 1000 mg/m2 per day continuous i.v. No statistically significant benefit in survival was observed for patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy.</s><s>We compared concomitant cisplatin and irradiation with radiotherapy alone as adjuvant treatment for stage III or IV head and neck cancer. After a median follow-up of 60 months, the rate of progression-free survival was significantly higher in the combined-therapy group than in the group given radiotherapy alone (P=0.04 by the log-rank test; hazard ratio for disease progression, 0.75; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.56 to 0.99), with 5-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of progression-free survival of 47 percent and 36 percent, respectively. The overall survival rate was also significantly higher in the combined-therapy group than in the radiotherapy group (P=0.02 by the log-rank test; hazard ratio for death, 0.70; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.95), with five-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival of 53 percent and 40 percent, respectively. Postoperative concurrent administration of high-dose cisplatin with radiotherapy is more efficacious than radiotherapy alone in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer and does not cause an undue number of late complications.</s><s>Between February 1978 and January 1984, 222 eligible patients were randomised in a multicentre trial of preoperative intra-arterial chemotherapy in the treatment of oral cavity and oropharynx carcinoma. Patients were randomised between either surgery or preoperative chemotherapy. The FM group received postoperative radiotherapy depending upon quality of the margins and lymph-node pathological involvement, when it was systematically applied in the POC group. Some discrepancies appeared between clinical regression and pathological response, and the number of cases without histological response was clearly higher than the number of cases without clinical response. In the FM group, median survival in the chemotherapy arm was estimated at 7 years compared with 3 years in the surgery arm. These differences do not exist in the POC group, which may be due to the systematically postoperative radiotherapy.</s><s>This trial of treatment for head and neck carcinoma was initiated in 1973 by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer. In this randomized study, we compared treatment results in 2 groups of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx (T2, T3, and T4; International Union Against Cancer classification). The occurrence of local toxic effects (i.e., mucositis and epidermatitis) was significantly greater in the RT-BLM group (RT-BLM, 72%, vs. RT, 21%).</s><s>There were 79 patients with squamous cell head and neck cancer randomized to receive simultaneous or 1 hour sequential methotrexate-5 fluorouracil (MTX--5-FU) chemotherapy: 47 patients were previously untreated and 32 patients had recurrent disease. The median survival for the 47 newly presenting patients was 22 months and for recurrent disease patients was 14 months. When only chemotherapy responders were compared, no difference in survival was detected for those who received sequential versus simultaneous therapy. Subsequently, 19 chemotherapy responders received radical radiation therapy, and 15 were rendered disease-free whereas only 4 of 17 chemotherapy nonresponders were rendered disease-free by subsequent radiation (P = .002).</s><s>Adjuvant intravenous methotrexate or definitive radiotherapy alone for advanced squamous cancers of the oral cavity, oropharynx, supraglottic larynx or hypopharynx.</s><s>The ability of surgery and radiotherapy to control advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck has reached its maximal potential. We initiated a randomized, prospective, stratified study of adjuvant chemotherapy. Standard therapy consisted of preoperative irradiation followed by radical surgery. Rates of residual and recurrent disease, as well as distant metastases, were similar for the two groups. The study has been discontinued because statistical analysis indicated that the addition of more patients would not materially increase the statistical significance of the study.</s><s>Phase 2 studies suggest that the standard regimen of cisplatin and fluorouracil (PF) plus docetaxel (TPF) improves outcomes in squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck. We randomly assigned eligible patients between the ages of 18 and 70 years who had stage III or stage IV disease and no distant metastases to receive either TPF (docetaxel and cisplatin, day 1; fluorouracil by continuous infusion, days 1 to 5) or PF every 3 weeks for four cycles. Patients without progression of disease received radiotherapy within 4 to 7 weeks after completing chemotherapy. A total of 358 patients underwent randomization, with 177 assigned to the TPF group and 181 to the PF group. Treatment with TPF resulted in a reduction in the risk of death of 27% (P=0.02), with a median overall survival of 18.8 months, as compared with 14.5 months in the PF group. As compared with the standard regimen of cisplatin and fluorouracil, induction chemotherapy with the addition of docetaxel significantly improved progression-free and overall survival in patients with unresectable squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck.</s><s>The Head and Neck Intergroup conducted a phase III randomized trial to test the benefit of adding chemotherapy to radiation in patients with unresectable squamous cell head and neck cancer. Eligible patients were randomly assigned between arm A (the control), single daily fractionated radiation (70 Gy at 2 Gy/d); arm B, identical radiation therapy with concurrent bolus cisplatin, given on days 1, 22, and 43; and arm C, a split course of single daily fractionated radiation and three cycles of concurrent infusional fluorouracil and bolus cisplatin chemotherapy, 30 Gy given with the first cycle and 30 to 40 Gy given with the third cycle. Survival data were compared between each experimental arm and the control arm using a one-sided log-rank test. Grade 3 or worse toxicity occurred in 52% of patients enrolled in arm A, compared with 89% enrolled in arm B (P <.0001) and 77% enrolled in arm C (P <.001). The addition of concurrent high-dose, single-agent cisplatin to conventional single daily fractionated radiation significantly improves survival, although it also increases toxicity.</s><s>Radiation therapy is often the primary treatment for advanced cases of head and neck cancers not considered suitable for radical surgery. From October 1990 to December 1997, 239 patients with squamous cell cancers originating in the head and neck region were randomized to one of three treatment options. The third study arm had identical fractionation and dose as the above accelerated treatment, with the additional administration of 20 mg/m(2) mitomycin C (MMC) on day 5 of treatment (V-CHART+MMC). Overall duration of mucositis was not different in the three treatment groups. Loco-regional tumour control was 31% after CF, 32% after V-CHART and 48% after V-CHART+MMC, respectively (P<0.05). A significant improvement regarding local tumour control and survival was seen following administration of MMC to the accelerated fractionated treatment.</s><s>Prospectively designed randomized clinical study was undertaken to assess the efficacy of simultaneous application of irradiation, Mitomycin C, and Bleomycin in treatment of patients with inoperable head and neck carcinoma. Patients in both groups were irradiated five times weekly with 2 Gy to the total dose of 66-70 Gy. The application of Mitomycin C was planned to be repeated on last day of radiotherapy in the dose of 10 mg/m2. The difference in complete response rate between both treatment groups (24% in group A and 63% in group B) was statistically significant (p = 0.015). Disease-free survival of patients in group A (9%) was significantly lower then in group B (48%) (p = 0.001). From results of our prospective randomized study it seems that the group of patients that received multidrug treatment with Mytomycin C, Bleomycin, Nicotinamide, Chlorpromazine, and Dicoumarol as enhancers of radiotherapy fared better than patients treated by radiotherapy alone.</s><s>We investigated a phase III randomized trial to compare efficacy and tolerance of CDDP + 5-FU to CDDP + VP16, both given intravenously in patients with unresectable advanced head and neck cancer. In 179 patients, tumor beds and cervical lymph nodes were irradiated, and 20 patients underwent salvage surgical procedures. Furthermore, we noted a higher cervical node regression with this chemotherapy combination. In the CDDP + 5-FU group, one patient had grade 4 cardiac dysfunction, and 3 patients exhibited unconsciousness that may be related to cerebral vascular damage. Thirteen patients died, with 8 cases related to septic shock (5 CPPP + VP16 and 3 CDDP + 5-FU). Although we could not show a benefit in survival with the CDDP + 5-FU protocol, this trial supports literature data and confirms that this regimen may be proposed as a first-line therapy in advanced cancer of the head and neck.</s><s>Fifty-four previously untreated patients with locally advanced resectable squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) were enrolled into a prospective randomized controlled trial to evaluate whether induction chemotherapy improves the disease-free survival compared to the standard treatment (surgery + radiation). However, patients who had a complete response were significantly better in terms of long-term survivors (5 of 7 patients were still alive), in contrast to patients who had partial responses among whom only 4 of 16 were alive. Toxicities of this induction protocol are tolerable; one chemotherapy-related death occurred from profound thrombocytopenia.</s><s>Concomitant chemoradiotherapy (CT/RT) is the standard treatment of locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). The primary end point was the rate of radiologic complete response (CR) at 6-8 weeks after the end of CT/RT. A total of 101 patients were randomly allocated to the study (51 arm A; 50 arm B). Median progression-free survival and overall survival were, respectively, 19.7 and 33.3 months (arm A) and 30.4 and 39.6 months (arm B). Hematologic and non-hematologic toxic effects during CT/RT were similar in the two arms.</s><s>Radiotherapy is the conventional treatment for locally advanced inoperable head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. However, the poor therapeutic results justify the development of radiochemotherapy combinations. In an attempt to improve local control and survival in patients with stage III and IV unresectable head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and based on the results of our previous dose escalation study, we undertook a prospective multicentric randomized trial. The 3, 5 and 10-year local-regional recurrence-free survival rates in stage IV disease were statistically better in arm II (21.5%, 15.9% and 15.9%) than in arm I (12.8%, 7.7% and 7.7%, respectively) (P = 0.04). However, our findings do not exclude that carboplatin may be beneficial, but the benefit in local control must be lower than the 15% assumed to dimension the trial.</s><s>Between 1983 and 1986, the National Institute for Cancer Research in Genoa and affiliated institutions conducted a randomized study to compare two different ways of combining chemotherapy (CT) and radiation therapy (RT). In treatment arm B, RT consisted of 60 Gy to involved areas and 50 Gy to the uninvolved neck in three courses of 20 Gy each, 2 Gy/fraction, ten fractions/2 weeks alternated with four courses of CT. CT consisted of vinblastine 6 mg/m2 intravenously followed 6 hours later by bleomycin 30 IU intramuscularly, day 1; methotrexate 200 mg intravenously, day 2; leucovorin rescue, day 3. Fifty-five patients were entered in treatment arm A and 61 in treatment arm B. Complete responses were 7/48 and 19/57 in treatment arms A and B, respectively (P less than 0.03). Mucosal tolerance was significantly worse in treatment arm B (P less than 0.00004).</s><s>For patients with advanced, unresectable squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck, radiotherapy is the standard treatment but has poor results. We therefore designed a randomized trial to determine whether alternating chemotherapy with radiotherapy would improve the survival of such patients. They were randomly assigned to chemotherapy consisting of four cycles of intravenous cisplatin (20 mg per square meter of body-surface area per day for five consecutive days) and fluorouracil (200 mg per square meter per day for five consecutive days) alternating with radiotherapy in three two-week courses (20 Gy per course; 2 Gy per day, five days per week), or to radiotherapy alone (up to 70 Gy; 2 Gy per day, five days per week). The 80 patients given chemotherapy alternating with radiotherapy and the 77 given radiotherapy alone were comparable in terms of age, sex, performance status, disease stage, and site of the primary tumor. Complete responses were obtained in 42 percent of the patients in the combined-therapy group and 22 percent of those in the radiotherapy group (P = 0.037).</s><s>To demonstrate the efficacy of radiochemotherapy (RCT) as the first choice of treatment for advanced unresectable head-and-neck cancer. In both arms, there was a second randomization for testing the effect of prophylactically given G-CSF (263 microg, days 15--19) on mucosal toxicity. Total RT dose in both arms was 69.9 Gy in 38 days, with a concomitant boost regimen (weeks 1--3: 1.8 Gy/day, weeks 4 and 5: b.i.d. Between July 1995 and May 1999, 263 patients were randomized (median age 56 years; 96% Stage IV tumors, 4% Stage III tumors). This analysis is based on 240 patients: 113 patients with RCT and 127 patients with RT, qualified for protocol and starting treatment. Treatment was tolerable in both arms, with a higher mucosal toxicity after RCT. Restaging showed comparable nonsignificant different CR + PR rates of 92.4% after RCT and 87.9% after RT (p = 0.29). For both tumor locations, prophylactically given G-CSF was a poor prognostic factor (Cox regression), and resulted in reduced LRC (log-rank test: +/- G-CSF, p = 0.0072).</s><s>The authors previously have found that in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCC-HN), alternating chemoradiotherapy (ALT) was superior to low-total-dose conventional radiotherapy alone. During 6 years, 136 consecutive patients with previously untreated unfavorable Stage II or Stage III-IV (International Union Against Cancer) SCC of the oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx were enrolled. At the median follow-up of 60 months (range, 30-102 months), no statistical differences were observed in overall survival, progression free survival, or locoregional control between the 2 treatments. Actuarial 3-year overall survival and progression free survival were 37% and 35%, respectively, in the ALT group and 29% and 27%, respectively, in PA-RT group. Actuarial 3-year locoregional control rates were 32% in the ALT group and 27% in the PA-RT group. At multivariate analysis, tumor classification was the only factor that emerged as a significant independent variable affecting overall survival. Moreover, local late mucosal and skin toxicities occurred more often in patients treated with PA-RT.</s><s>From March 1983 to December 1989, 208 patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were successively included into two randomized induction chemotherapy trials. Local treatment was the same in the two trials: primary radiotherapy in all patients. The tumor and lymph node responses to chemotherapy (complete and partial response) were higher in the second trial than in the first: 70% versus 50% for primary lesions, 47% versus 25% for lymph nodes. In the two trials, an initial major response to chemotherapy predicted subsequent efficacy of irradiation in 80% of the patients. The significance of the complete response at the end of the irradiation varies with the previous response to the chemotherapy. With a median follow-up of 60 months with the first chemotherapy regimen and 30 months with the second, overall survival and disease-free interval were very similar in the two groups.</s><s>Either intra-arterial infusions of MTX (500 mg over 10 days) or intra-arterial infusions of BLM (95 mg over 13 days) were administered as initial treatment to 85 patients with untreated squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity. A sequential analysis was used, and BLM demonstrated a significantly greater local efficacy after the 32nd matched pair was assessed.</s><s>The purpose of the present study was to determine the safety and efficacy of induction chemotherapy followed by concomitant chemoradiotherapy. Acute morbidity and deaths during intervention were higher in the study group (p = 0.007). This study suggests that induction along with concomitant chemoradiotherapy is too toxic for routine use and also fails to provide a survival benefit.</s><s>Unresectable carcinomas of the oropharynx and hypopharynx still have a poor long-term prognosis. Following a previous phase II study, this phase III multicenter trial was conducted between November 1997 and March 2002. Twice-daily radiation: two fractions of 1.2 Gy/day, 5 days per week, with no split (D1-->D46). Total tumor doses: 80.4 Gy/46 day (oropharynx), 75.6 Gy/44 day (hypopharynx). Grade 3-4 acute mucositis 82.6% arm B/69.5% arm A (NS); Grade 3-4 neutropenia 33.3% arm B/2.4% arm A (p < 0.05). No significant difference between the two arms in the amount of side effects at 1 and 2 years.</s><s>The standard treatment for advanced (stage III and IV) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (i.e., surgery with postoperative radiotherapy in operable patients and radiotherapy alone in inoperable patients) has had poor results. A series of randomized trials of induction chemotherapy have up to now failed to demonstrate an improvement in survival. This trial was designed to determine whether intensive induction chemotherapy administered before loco-regional treatment would improve survival of patients with advanced disease. Patients had previously untreated, advanced nonmetastatic (stages III and IV) squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and paranasal sinuses. Eligible patients (n = 237) were randomly assigned to receive either initial chemotherapy (cisplatin and infusional fluorouracil) followed by loco-regional treatment (group A, n = 118) or loco-regional treatment alone (group B, n = 119). For inoperable patients, radical irradiation was performed with a planned dose of 65-70 Gy to involved areas. The analysis of time to distant metastases showed an advantage for group A patients. (Respective 2- and 3-year values for inoperable patients were 15% and 24% for group A versus 36% and 42% for group B, P = .04; only one operable group A patient had distant metastases after 49 months versus 26% [2 years] and 31% [3 years] for operable group B patients, P = .01.) For inoperable patients, neoadjuvant chemotherapy improved local control, decreased the incidence of distant metastases, and improved the complete remission rate and overall survival. Confirmatory studies with effective chemotherapy regimens delivered for an adequate number of cycles are required.</s><s>Although induction chemotherapy administered prior to local therapy produces encouraging initial response rates in head and neck cancer, randomized studies have failed to demonstrate an improvement in survival rates. All randomized studies included only patients with advanced stage III and IV disease. In our opinion, this is the main reason for the low rate of complete responses demonstrated in the randomized trials (maximum 18%). estimate that a 40%-50% complete response rate is necessary before improved survival rates are seen. To date, such complete response rates with induction chemotherapy have only been attainable in resectable T2-T3, N0-N2 disease. Therefore, we initiated a prospective randomized trial including only patients with the mentioned disease stages.</s><s>We report the 5-year survival and late toxicity results of a randomized clinical trial, which showed a 3-year improvement in overall survival and locoregional control of stage III or IV oropharynx carcinoma, using concomitant radiochemotherapy (arm B), compared with standard radiotherapy (arm A). Five-year overall survival, specific disease-free survival, and locoregional control rates were 22% and 16% (log-rank P =.05), 27% and 15% (P =.01), and 48% and 25% (P =.002), in arm B and arm A, respectively. Concomitant radiochemotherapy improved overall survival and locoregional control rates and does not statistically increase severe late morbidity.</s><s>A prospective randomized multicenter trial was performed to evaluate the contribution of simultaneously administered chemotherapy (CT) and radiotherapy (RT) in previously untreated patients with unresectable stage III/IV head and neck cancer. RT was identical in both arms and administered in three courses with 13 fractions of 1.8 Gy each twice daily. In arm B, cisplatin (CDDP) 60 mg/m2, fluorouracil (5-FU) 350 mg/m2 by intravenous (i.v.) Treatment was repeated on days 22 and 44; a total RT dose of 70.2 Gy was administered. From 1989 to 1993, 298 patients were enrolled and 270 patients were assessable. Acute mucositis grade 3 or 4 was more frequent in arm B (38%) than in arm A (16%) (P < .001). The 3-year overall survival rate was 24% in arm A and 48% in arm B (P < .0003). Concomitant CT offered improved disease control and survival in advanced head and neck cancer patients. Due to increased acute toxicity, more supportive care is demanded when CT is given simultaneously.</s><s>From March 1983 to June 1986, 100 patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were randomized to receive either two courses of chemotherapy prior to local therapy (group A), or local therapy alone (group B). The chemotherapy regimen was a combination of cisplatinum, bleomycin, vindesine, and mitomycin C. The response rate to induction chemotherapy (group A) was 50% for the primary tumor (CR: 10% and PR: 40%). The response rate to induction chemotherapy for lymph node metastases was 27.1% (CR: 9% and PR: 18.1%). The survival rates in groups A and B were 66.5% vs. 65.1% at 1 year and 35% vs. 46.2% at 2 years. After adjustment for these factors, the chemotherapy did not seem to improve the effectiveness of the local treatment in terms of loco-regional control and survival.</s><s>For several decades, both preoperative intra-arterial chemotherapy and preoperative irradiation have been accepted treatments for patients with tumors of the head and neck. Unfortunately, arguments have often been put forward in favor of one or other of the two methods, but without the performance of an objective, randomized investigation. By the end of the 5 years, 95 of the 131 patients had conformed to the protocol. Of those 95, 47 had received preoperative chemotherapy and 48 preoperative irradiation. After 5 years, 18 of the 47 patients who received chemotherapy and 15 of the 48 patients who received irradiation were still alive and tumor free. A few more patients had died of recurrence or regional metastasis in the chemotherapy group (23 patients) than in the irradiation group (20 patients). Regarding postoperative quality of life, the chemotherapy group presented a more favorable picture. Regarding postoperative quality of life, patients who underwent intra-arterial chemotherapy appeared to be in a slightly more favorable situation.</s><s>A randomized phase 3 trial of the treatment of squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck compared induction chemotherapy with docetaxel plus cisplatin and fluorouracil (TPF) with cisplatin and fluorouracil (PF), followed by chemoradiotherapy. Estimates of overall survival at 3 years were 62% in the TPF group and 48% in the PF group; the median overall survival was 71 months and 30 months, respectively (P=0.006). There was better locoregional control in the TPF group than in the PF group (P=0.04), but the incidence of distant metastases in the two groups did not differ significantly (P=0.14). Patients with squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck who received docetaxel plus cisplatin and fluorouracil induction chemotherapy plus chemoradiotherapy had a significantly longer survival than did patients who received cisplatin and fluorouracil induction chemotherapy plus chemoradiotherapy.</s><s>To test the efficacy of sequential chemotherapy as an adjuvant to surgery and postoperative radiotherapy for patients with locally-advanced but operable squamous cell cancers of the head and neck region, a randomized clinical trial was conducted under the auspices of the Head and Neck Intergroup (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group, Southwest Oncology Group, Eastern Oncology Group, Cancer and Leukemia Group B, Northern California Oncology Group, and Southeast Group). Eligible patients had completely resected tumors of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx. Patients were categorized as having either \"low-risk\" or \"high-risk\" treatment volumes depending on whether the surgical margin was greater than or equal to 5 mm, there was extracapsular nodal extension, and/or there was carcinoma-in-situ at the surgical margins. A total of 442 analyzable patients were entered into this study with the mean-time-at-risk being 45.7 months at the time of the present analysis. The 4-year actuarial survival rate was 44% on the RT arm and 48% on the CT/RT arm (p = n.s.).</s><s>A prospective randomized study was conducted to evaluate the benefit of adjuvant levamisole/UFT (futraful and uracil) chemotherapy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Thirty-one patients were randomized for chemotherapy and two of them were subsequently excluded. The 5-year disease-free actuarial survival rates for patients with and without adjuvant chemotherapy were 57% and 39% respectively (P=0.207). However, there was no statistically significant improvement in the overall long-term survival. It may be of value to conduct a large-scale multi-centre prospective randomized study to verify the efficacy of levamisole and UFT as post-operative adjuvant chemotherapy for the control of distant metastasis in high-risk population.</s><s>Two regimens of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for previously untreated patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer were compared with the goal of identifying a regimen with a greater than 50% complete response (CR) rate. Patients with a performance status of greater than 2 or a carbon monoxide diffusion capacity of less than 50% of the predicted value were assigned to the arm A regimen but were analyzed separately (arm C). Of the 42 patients who were evaluated, 16 were randomized to arm A, 13 to arm B, and 13 to arm C. The clinical CR rate was 19% on arm A (95% confidence interval, 0% to 38%), 39% on arm B (95% confidence interval, 12% to 66%) (P = 0.41), and 54% on arm C (95% confidence interval, 27% to 81%). The incidence of moderate to severe mucositis was significantly higher on arm A than arm B (P = 0.02). Two cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy were administered to only 11 of 42 patients due to patient refusal or cumulative toxicity.</s><s>A multicentric, randomized study of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the oral cavity and the oropharynx has been undertaken by DOSAK. The results after radical surgery alone have been compared with the results of combined preoperative radiochemotherapy followed by radical surgery. The percentages were higher after radical surgery alone for locoregional recurrence (31% and 15.6%) and for death (28% and 18.6%). The life-table analysis showed improved survival rates of 4.5% after 1 year and 8.3% after 2 years in the group of patients treated with combined therapy. The demonstrated improvement appeared to be significant with the Gehan-Wilcoxon test as well as with the log rank test below a P value of 5%.</s><s>Chemotherapy has been reported to be especially active in oral cavity tumors. In both arms, postoperative radiotherapy was reserved to high-risk patients, and surgery was modulated depending on the tumor's closeness to the mandible. Postoperative radiotherapy was administered in 33% of patients in the chemotherapy arm, versus 46% in the control arm. However, in this study, primary chemotherapy seemed to play a role in reducing the number of patients who needed to undergo mandibulectomy and/or radiation therapy.</s><s>From 1987 to 1989, 42 patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (Stages III-IV, Mo) were randomized to receive radiotherapy (Group A) or three courses of induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (Group B). The complete response rate in Group A was 65%; in group B it was 31.5% after induction chemotherapy and 84% after radiotherapy. The 42-month actuarial overall survival rates were 34% for Group A and 47% for Group B (P = NS). The chemotherapy regimen was well tolerated, with moderate hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity.</s><s>In 1980, the Southwest Oncology Group instituted a multi-institutional, prospective, randomized phase III trial to evaluate whether inductive chemotherapy improved survival in patients with advanced stage resectable squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. From a group of 158 eligible patients, 76 were randomized to conventional treatment (surgery and postoperative radiotherapy), and 82 were assigned to experimental treatment (induction chemotherapy, surgery, postoperative radiotherapy).</s><s>This is an interim report of a study of perioperative adjuvant chemotherapy following radical surgery for oral cancer, based on the hypothesis of Goldie and Coleman. The test arm received methotrexate 50 mg/m2 on the 3rd, 10th, and 17th postoperative days. Analysis of recurrence pattern showed that recurrence at the primary site was dramatically reduced during the first 6 postoperative months (P less than 0.01).</s><s>The role of postoperative radiotherapy and carboplatin in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) has not been established. Seventy-six patients were randomized, of whom 72 were eligible and analyzable (36 in each arm). The overall survival at 2 and 5 years was 74% and 47% in arm B versus 51% (P = .04) and 41% (P = .61) in arm A. We could not demonstrate a benefit with the addition of carboplatin to postoperative radiotherapy, possibly because of insufficient sample size.</s><s>We report the results of a multicenter randomized phase III study, assessing quality of life (QOL) in intra-arterial (IA) versus standard intravenous (IV) chemoradiation in advanced head and neck cancer. The QOL assessments carried out were EORTC-C30, H&N35, and trial-specific questionnaires. Overall QOL deteriorated in all patients during treatment, is gradually improving over 1 year. During treatment, significantly fewer problems with nausea and vomiting occurred in IA than in IV patients.</s><s>The objective of this article was to report the results from a randomized trial that evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of adding tirapazamine (TPZ) to chemoradiotherapy in the treatment of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). Patients who did not achieve a complete response at 50 Grays underwent surgical treatment. The complete clinical and pathologic response rate in the lymph nodes was 90% and 74% for the standard treatment arm and the TPZ arm, respectively (P = .08) and 89% and 90% at the primary site in the respective treatment arms (P = .71). The 5-year overall survival rate was 59%, the cause-specific survival rate was 68%, the rate of freedom from recurrence was 69%, and the locoregional control rate was 77% for the entire group. The significant long-term toxicity rate also was found to be similar between the 2 arms. The addition of TPZ increased hematologic toxicity but did not improve outcomes in patients with resectable, Stage IV HNSCC using the protocol administered this small randomized study.</s><s>Several phase II studies have shown that concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT) improves the response rates and locoregional control in patients with advanced, unresectable squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck (H&N). The primary objective of the study was to compare the side effects and the response rates of the two regimens. Radiotherapy was given at conventional dosages, 2 Gy for 5 days every week for a total dose of 64 Gy with CDDP 80 mg/m2 or CRP 375 mg/m2 for three cycles on days 1, 21 and 42. At present 53 patients are entered in the study: 27 in the CDDP arm and 26 in the CRP. On the other hand, CRP-RT gives a significantly higher incidence of stomatitis (p=0.0067) and a marginally worse thrombocytopenia (p=0.09). The complete response (CR) rates were similar in the two arms (55.5% in the CDDP-RT versus 61.5% in that CRP-RT, respectively) as well as the overall response rates (92.5% versus 84.5%, respectively; p=0.36). We conclude that concurrent chemo-radiotherapy is an effective and safe treatment for patients with locally advanced H&N cancer. Survival results need to be assessed in a larger series and followed for a more prolonged time.</s><s>The relevance of tumor size and cell kinetics as predictors of radiation response in head and neck cancer. A randomized study on the effect of intraarterial chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy.</s><s>Radiopotentiation by chemical sensitizers and cytotoxic drugs has been attempted since 1960, the best results being obtained by a combination of irradiation and bleomycin. The present three-armed trial attempted to improve the results of radiotherapy and bleomycin by the addition of hyperthermia. A total of 101 T3 and T4 buccal squamous cancers were entered in the trial over a period of nearly three years.</s><s>Forty-six patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck region were randomized to either irradiation or irradiation plus bleomycin.</s><s>Between January 1988 and December 1991, 159 patients with Stage III/IV (M0) squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were randomized to receive standard fraction RT (70 Gy) (group I) or the same RT plus either 6 mg/m2 of cisplatin (CDPP) (group II) or 25 mg/ m2 of carboplatin (CBDCA) both given daily during RT (group III). Patients in groups II and III had significantly higher overall response rates then those in group I (P = 0.011 and P = 0.0025, respectively) with no difference between groups II and III (P = 0.60). Median time to local recurrence (MTLR) and 5-year local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) were significantly higher for both RT/CHT when compared to RT alone (MTLR, not attained yet and 30 months versus 10 months, respectively; 5-year LRFS, 51% and 48% versus 27%, respectively; P = 0.018 and P = 0.040, respectively) with no difference between the two RT/CHT groups. There was no difference between the three treatment groups regarding regional lymph node and distant metastasis control.</s><s>Promising results in a randomized phase II trial with the hypoxic cytotoxin tirapazamine (TPZ) combined with cisplatin (CIS) and radiation led to this phase III trial. Patients with previously untreated stage III or IV (excluding T1-2N1 and M1) squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx were randomly assigned to receive definitive radiotherapy (70 Gy in 7 weeks) concurrently with either CIS (100 mg/m(2)) on day 1 of weeks 1, 4, and 7 or CIS (75 mg/m(2)) plus TPZ (290 mg/m(2)/d) on day 1 of weeks 1, 4, and 7 and TPZ alone (160 mg/m(2)/d) on days 1, 3, and 5 of weeks 2 and 3 (TPZ/CIS). Eight hundred sixty-one patients were accrued from 89 sites in 16 countries.</s><s>Despite the use of resection and postoperative radiotherapy, high-risk squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck frequently recurs in the original tumor bed. After a median follow-up of 45.9 months, the rate of local and regional control was significantly higher in the combined-therapy group than in the group given radiotherapy alone (hazard ratio for local or regional recurrence, 0.61; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.41 to 0.91; P=0.01). The estimated two-year rate of local and regional control was 82 percent in the combined-therapy group, as compared with 72 percent in the radiotherapy group. Among high-risk patients with resected head and neck cancer, concurrent postoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy significantly improve the rates of local and regional control and disease-free survival. However, the combined treatment is associated with a substantial increase in adverse effects.</s><s>A randomized trial was designed to compare cisplatin (CDDP) and fluorouracil (FU) versus carboplatin (CBDCA) and FU as neoadjuvant treatment in stage IV-M0 head and neck cancer to assess whether CBDCA-FU is better than CDDP-FU with regard to response and toxicity. The trial was stopped due to significantly better results in the control arm. Mucositis and vomiting predominated in the CDDP-FU arm (P = .03, P < .001, respectively). Only the treatment assigned was associated with response (P = .02) and favorable outcomes (P = .009) in the logistic regression analysis. In the CDDP-FU arm, disease-free and overall survival were significantly better.</s><s>Radiotherapy is often the primary treatment for advanced head and neck cancer, but the rates of locoregional recurrence are high and survival is poor. We investigated whether hyperfractionated irradiation plus concurrent chemotherapy (combined treatment) is superior to hyperfractionated irradiation alone. Patients in the combined-treatment group received 125 cGy twice daily, for a total of 7000 cGy, and five days of treatment with 12 mg of cisplatin per square meter of body-surface area per day and 600 mg of fluorouracil per square meter per day during weeks 1 and 6 of irradiation. Of 122 patients who underwent randomization, 116 were included in the analysis. The relapse-free survival rate was higher in the combined-treatment group (61 percent vs. 41 percent, P=0.08). Confluent mucositis developed in 77 percent and 75 percent of the two groups, respectively. Severe complications occurred in three patients in the hyperfractionation group and five patients in the combined-treatment group.</s><s>Between 1975 and 1978, 23 patients with Stage IV, unresectable, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were randomized to receive radiotherapy (RT, 11 patients), or radiotherapy-chemotherapy (RT & CT, 12 patients). The duration of objectives remission was longer among the RT & CT patients when compared with RT patients (6 vs. 2.3 months, P = 0.18). One RT & CT patient remains alive with disease at 44 months, one RT patient remains alive without disease at 30 months. The present chemotherapy regimen did not modify the pattern of failure and only marginally increased patient survival.</s><s>Management of advanced head and neck carcinoma is a challenging proposition. Presently concomitant chemo-irradiation has become the standard of care in such patients. Many chemotherapeutic drugs have shown radio-sensitising effects when used concomitantly along with radiation. The present study was carried out with the objective of assessing the feasibility and efficacy of low dose gemcitabine as radiosensitizer when used during radical radiotherapeutic management of patients with locally advanced head and neck carcinomas. From November 2000 to March 2003, eighty histopathologically proven cases of squamous cell head and neck carcinoma were included in this trial, 40 patients were randomly assigned to receive radiotherapy alone and 40 patients to receive gemcitabine along with radiotherapy.</s><s>This study compared the activity and toxicity of fluorouracil (5-FU)/ cisplatin with the combination tegafur and uracil (UFT)/cisplatin in the neoadjuvant treatment of locally advanced-stage III or IV (MO)-head and neck cancer. Group 1 was comprised of 34 patients, 30 of whom were men, with a median age of 57.5 years; 79% of this group had a Karnofsky performance status of 90% to 100%; 70% had a squamous and 29% an undifferentiated histology. Overall response in group 1 was 73% (21% complete) compared with 79% (18% complete) in group 2. Toxicity was also similar, except for phlebitis, which occurred significantly more often in group 1 (71% vs 9%).</s><s>Two hundred and forty-one patients, with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck, were randomized to receive three courses of induction chemotherapy. Tolerance was significantly better with the CDDP regimen (p less than 0.05); severe side effects, affecting mainly digestive tract, and bone marrow, were encountered in 7% of the patients in the CDDP group, vs 15% in the MOB-P group, without death related to pancytopenia. Short-term results were better for patients treated by the MOB-P regimen, with a 42% response rate (including 9 complete responses) vs 22% with the CDDP regimen (p = 0.01).</s><s>Preliminary results of a randomized study on preoperative intra-arterial chemotherapy combined with surgery and irradiation for carcinomas of the floor of the mouth.</s><s>Between 1990 and 2000, we examined the effect of timing of non-platinum chemotherapy when combined with radiotherapy. We aimed to determine whether giving chemotherapy concurrently with radiotherapy or as maintenance therapy, or both, affected clinical outcome. Patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer, and who had not previously undergone surgery, were randomly assigned to one of four groups in a 3:2:2:2 ratio, stratified by centre and chemotherapy regimen: radical radiotherapy alone (n=233); radiotherapy with two courses of chemotherapy given simultaneously on days 1 and 14 of radiotherapy (SIM alone; n=166); or 14 and 28 days after completing radiotherapy (SUB alone, n=160); or both (SIM+SUB; n=154). Chemotherapy was either methotrexate alone, or vincristine, bleomycin, methotrexate, and fluorouracil. Among the patients who had previously undergone surgery, median overall survival was 5.0 (99% CI 1.8-8.0) and 4.6 (2.2-7.6) years in the radiotherapy alone and SIM alone groups (p=0.70), respectively, with corresponding median EFS of 3.7 (99% CI 1.1-5.9) and 3.0 (1.2-5.6) years (p=0.85), respectively. The percentage of patients who had a significant toxicity at least 6 months after randomisation were: 6% (radiotherapy alone, n=13), 6% (SIM alone, n=10), 4% (SUB alone, n=7), and 6% (SIM+SUB, n=9) among patients who had no previous surgery; and 7% (radiotherapy alone, n=10) and 11% (SIM alone, n=13) among those who had undergone previous surgery. The most common toxicity 6 months after treatment was xerostomia, but this occurred in 3% or less of patients in each group. Concurrent non-platinum chemoradiotherapy reduces recurrences, new tumours, and deaths in patients who have not undergone previous surgery, even 10 years after starting treatment. Chemotherapy given after radiotherapy (with or without concurrent chemotherapy) is ineffective.

One hundred twenty-two previously untreated patients with stage III/IV SCC of the head and neck were randomized to receive definitive radiotherapy (70 Gy in 7 weeks) concurrently with either cisplatin (75 mg/m(2)) plus tirapazamine (290 mg/m(2)/d) on day 2 of weeks 1, 4, and 7, and tirapazamine alone (160 mg/m(2)/d) on days 1, 3, and 5 of weeks 2 and 3 (TPZ/CIS), or cisplatin (50 mg/m(2)) on day 1 and infusional fluorouracil (360 mg/m(2)/d) on days 1 through 5 of weeks 6 and 7 (chemoboost). Three-year locoregional failure-free rates were 84% in the TPZ/CIS arm (95% CI, 71% to 92%) and 66% in the chemoboost arm (95% CI, 51% to 79%; P = .069). Both regimens are feasible and are associated with significant but acceptable toxicity profiles in the cooperative group setting.</s><s>To compare conventional fractionation radiation therapy (RT), Arm A, vs. split-course accelerated hyperfractionated RT (S-AHF), Arm B, vs. conventional fractionation RT plus concomitant chemotherapy (CT), Arm C, in terms of survival and toxicity for advanced, unresectable epidermoid tumors of oropharynx. For Arms A and C, 66-70 Gy in 33-35 fractions, 5 days a week, were administered in 6.5-7 weeks to tumor and positive nodes. In Arm B, the dose delivered to tumor and involved nodes was 64-67.2 Gy, giving 2 fractions of 1.6 Gy every day with an interfraction interval of at least 4 h and preferably 6 h, 5 days a week. Similarly, there was no statistically significant difference in terms of event-free survival (p = 0.196): 20% for Arm A, 19% for Arm B, and 37% for Arm C were event free at 24 months. Patients in Arm A less frequently developed G3+ acute mucositis than their counterparts in Arm B or C (14.7% vs. 40.3% vs. 44%). The occurrence of persistent G3 xerostomia was comparable in all three treatment arms. This improvement, however, did not translate into an overall survival improvement, and was associated with a higher incidence of acute morbidity.</s>"

Fifty RA patients entered a 24-week double-blind, randomised, controlled-study of two different dietary regimens (an experimental diet high in unsaturated fats, low in saturated fats with hypoallergenic foods vs. a control well-balanced diet). The experimental diet group did better for all the variables considered but only four variables (Ritchie's index, tender and swollen joints, and ESR) reached a statistical difference by multivariate analysis. Dietary manipulation, either by modifying food supplements or by reducing weight, may give some clinical benefit although no significant improvement can be observed assessing the results with a composite index.</s><s>The role of diet in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remains controversial and there have been no controlled studies on the use of elemental diet in the treatment of RA. Elemental diet is an hypoallergenic protein-free artificial diet consisting of essential amino acids, glucose, trace elements and vitamins. Where a food was suspected of causing symptoms it was removed from the diet. The diet group lost more weight than the control group and this correlated with the improvement in grip strength. As the improvements took place in more subjective disease parameters and because of the difficulties in adequately blinding studies of diet in arthritis, a placebo effect must be considered. In conclusion, this study shows that elemental diet can cause an improvement in a number of disease parameters in RA but this is not sustained by an individualized diet.</s><s>In a blind, placebo-controlled study of dietary manipulation therapy in outpatients with rheumatoid arthritis there was significant objective improvement during periods of dietary therapy compared with periods of placebo treatment, particularly among \"good responders\".</s><s>Elemental diets provide food in its simplest formulation and have been used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other chronic inflammatory diseases. Patients with active RA were single-blindly randomized either to a liquid elemental peptide-diet for four weeks or to continuation of the usual food (control group). The outcome measurements were pain intensity, morning stiffness, HAQ-score, number of swollen joints, joint tenderness, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and patient's global assessment of health. The study showed that the peptide diet can improve some subjective and objective disease parameters.</s><s>16 patients with classical rheumatoid arthritis (RA) selected at random underwent fasting for 7--10 days, followed by a 9-week period on a lactovegetarian diet. Pain, stiffness, medication, and clinical and biochemical findings were recorded before fasting, on the first day after the conclusion of the fasting period, and at the end of the lactovegetarian period. After fasting, 5 of 15 patients showed objective signs of improvement, compared with only one of the controls. No differences were found between the Diet patients and the controls concerning symptoms, drug consumption, or clinical and biochemical variables.</s><s>This pilot study aimed to determine if an elemental diet could be used to treat patients with active rheumatoid arthritis and to compare its effect to that of oral prednisolone. All clinical parameters improved in both groups (p<0.05) except the swollen joint score in the elemental diet group. An elemental diet for 2 weeks resulted in a clinical improvement in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis, and was as effective as a course of oral prednisolone 15 mg daily in improving subjective clinical parameters. This study supports the concept that rheumatoid arthritis may be a reaction to a food antigen(s) and that the disease process starts within the intestine.</s><s>We tested the effects of an uncooked vegan diet, rich in lactobacilli, in rheumatoid patients randomized into diet and control groups. The intervention group experienced subjective relief of rheumatic symptoms during intervention. Half of the patients experienced adverse effects (nausea, diarrhoea) during the diet and stopped the experiment prematurely. Indicators of rheumatic disease activity did not differ statistically between groups. Stepwise regression analysis associated a decrease in the disease activity (measured as change in the Disease Activity Score, DAS) with lactobacilli-rich and chlorophyll-rich drinks, increase in fibre intake, and no need for gold, methotrexate or steroid medication (R2=0.48, P=0.02).</s><s>Whether food intake can modify the course of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an issue of continued scientific and public interest. We thus decided to study the clinical effects of a vegan diet free of gluten in RA and to quantify the levels of antibodies to key food antigens not present in the vegan diet. Sixty-six patients with active RA were randomized to either a vegan diet free of gluten (38 patients) or a well-balanced non-vegan diet (28 patients) for 1 yr. All patients were instructed and followed-up in the same manner. Corresponding figures for the intention to treat populations were 34.3 and 3.8%, respectively. No retardation of radiological destruction was apparent in any of the groups. The data provide evidence that dietary modification may be of clinical benefit for certain RA patients, and that this benefit may be related to a reduction in immunoreactivity to food antigens eliminated by the change in diet.</s><s>Although diet therapy for arthritis has received considerable publicity, there is little objective information about its efficacy. We undertook a 10-week, controlled, double-blind, randomized trial of patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Six RA patients on the placebo and 5 on the experimental diet improved by objective criteria. Two patients on the experimental diet improved notably, elected to remain on the experimental diet following the study period, have continued to improve, and noted exacerbations of disease upon consuming nonexperimental diet foods.</s><s>To investigate the efficacy of a Mediterranean diet (MD) versus an ordinary Western diet for suppression of disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Clinical examinations were performed at baseline, and again in the 3rd, 6th, and 12th week. A composite disease activity index (DAS28), a physical function index (Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ)), a health survey of quality of life (Short Form-36 (SF-36)), and the daily consumption of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were used as primary efficacy variables. This difference between the two treatment groups was notable only in the second half of the trial. The results indicate that patients with RA, by adjusting to a Mediterranean diet, did obtain a reduction in inflammatory activity, an increase in physical function, and improved vitality.</s><s>To evaluate the extent of food allergy/intolerance in rheumatoid arthritis, an elemental (hypoallergenic) diet was studied in a controlled, double-blind pilot study. Ten patients were allocated to an experimental group and 7 to a control group. During the 4th week of the study the patients in both groups resumed their regular diet. A significant improvement was found in the number of tender joints (p = 0.04) in the experimental group, whereas improvement was found in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (p = 0.03) and in the thrombocyte count (p = 0.02) in the control group. There was no significant difference in disease activity variables between the two groups.</s>"

The control group received additional usual arm therapy of a similar duration and frequency to the experimental treatment. Although both experimental and control groups of participants improved similarly during the study period, the statistical analyses did not show any difference between the groups at the end of the treatment for the different dependent variables evaluated: (1) arm impairments: p = 0.43-0.79; (2) arm disabilities: p = 0.16-0.90; and (3) functional independence: p = 0.63 and 0.90.</s><s>This work was designed to study the effects of bilateral elbow flexion on the reaction and movement times of the impaired upper extremity of patients with hemiparesis. The subjects consisted of an experimental group of patients with hemiparesis (n = 25) and a control group of age-matched healthy volunteers (n = 26). Two of these sets required unilateral movements, one for each upper extremity. The third set of movements required simultaneous elbow flexions of both upper extremities. It was speculated that in patients with hemiparesis, movement time of the nonparetic extremity in the bilateral task is limited by the rate of performance of the paretic extremity.</s><s>Recovery of movement in the densely hemiplegic upper extremity remains a problem after stroke. This study aimed to determine whether movement recovery could be improved in the hemiplegic arm with bilateral isokinematic training. However, these increases were not significantly different from the previous unilateral trial, and the bilateral effect failed to generalize to subsequent trials. Extensive lesions may limit brain reorganization and recover of dense hemiplegia after stroke.</s><s>To determine the extent to which inter-limb coordination in the execution of unimanual and bimanual tasks was impaired following stroke.Methods. Movements were recorded using electromagnetic sensors attached to the wrists and a series of micro switches placed under the objects. Main outcome measures included time to complete components of the tasks; comparison between sides; deviation of the hands from a linear trajectory; coordination of the two sides as indicated by relative phase angle.Results. This impairment in coordination was not due to lateral deviation of the impaired limb.</s><s>To investigate the effect of bilateral reaching, with/without inertial loading on the unaffected arm, on hemiparetic arm motor control in stroke. Kinematical parameters were utilized to quantify the reaching performance of the affected arm. No matter whether loading was applied on the unaffected arm or not, the bilateral reaching task did not significantly facilitate smoother and faster movement. Furthermore, during bilateral reaching task with/without loading on the unaffected arm, stroke patients showed slower movement, lower maximal movement velocity, feedback control dominant and discontinuous movements in the affected arm than the same task with unilateral reaching. The amount of trunk movement also increased during bilateral reaching either with or without loading on the unaffected arm. Patients with moderate upper extremity motor impairment performed more discontinuous movements and less active elbow range of motion during bilateral reaching tasks; however, those with mild upper extremity motor impairment performed smoother movements and demonstrated greater active elbow range of motion during bilateral reaching tasks.</s><s>This study presents results from a randomized controlled clinical trial of the Mirror Image Movement Enabler (MIME) robotic device for shoulder and elbow neurorehabilitation in subacute stroke patients, including data on the use of its bilateral training mode. MIME incorporates a PUMA 560 robot (Staubli Unimation Inc, Duncan, South Carolina) that applies forces to the paretic limb during unilateral and bilateral movements in three dimensions. However, gains in all treatment groups were equivalent at the 6-month follow-up. Robot-assisted treatment gains exceeded those expected from spontaneous recovery.</s><s>Reorganization in central motor networks occurs during early recovery from hemiparetic stroke. To test the hypothesis that in patients who have chronic motor impairment following stroke, specific rehabilitation therapy that improves arm function is associated with reorganization of cortical networks. A randomized controlled clinical trial conducted in a US ambulatory rehabilitation program with 21 patients (median [IQR], 50.3 [34.8-77.3] months after unilateral stroke). Patients were randomly assigned to bilateral arm training with rhythmic auditory cueing (BATRAC) (n = 9) or standardized dose-matched therapeutic exercises (DMTE) (n = 12). Patients in the BATRAC group but not in the DMTE group increased hemispheric activation during paretic arm movement (P = .03). Considering all patients, there were no differences in functional outcome between groups.</s><s>Most studies of bilateral arm training (BAT) did not employ a randomized controlled trial design and involved very limited functional training tasks. Compare the effects of BAT with control intervention (CI) on motor control and motor performance of the upper extremity and also functional gains in patients with chronic stroke. The BAT group showed a significantly greater improvement in the FMA than the control group but not in the FIM and MAL. Relative to CI, BAT improved the spatiotemporal control of the affected arm in both bilateral and unilateral tasks, decreased online corrections to perform bilateral tasks, and reduced motor impairment.</s><s>Functional cortical reorganisation had been demonstrated to accompany recovery from motor stroke. By means of two dual motor tasks it was further investigated whether the reduced skilfulness of patients was due to an increased attentional demand and thus a reduced automaticity of motor control. Interference effects by dual tasks, however, were similar for patients and control subjects. By means of a repetitive daily training for 1 week based on the Arm Ability Training approach, patients were able to reduce their performance deficits in both movement phases significantly.</s><s>Overcoming chronic hemiparesis from a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) can be challenging for many patients, especially after the first 12 months after the CVA. Twenty-five CVA subjects volunteered to participate in this motor recovery protocol study. All participants completed 6 hours of rehabilitation during a 2-week period according to group assignments. Significant findings for the (1) number of blocks moved in a functional task, (2) chronometric reaction times to initiate movements, and (3) sustained muscle contraction capability all favored the coupled bilateral movement training and EMG-triggered neuromuscular stimulation protocol group. Chronic hemiparesis decreased considerably in the wrist and fingers as CVA patients expanded their motor repertoire.</s><s>This study investigated the relative effects of distributed constraint-induced therapy (CIT) and bilateral arm training (BAT) on motor performance, daily function, functional use of the affected arm, and quality of life in patients with hemiparetic stroke. A total of 60 patients were randomized to distributed CIT, BAT, or a control intervention of less specific but active therapy. Each group received intensive training for 2 hours/day, 5 days/week, for 3 weeks. Pretreatment and posttreatment measures included the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), Functional Independence Measure (FIM), Motor Activity Log (MAL), and Stroke Impact Scale (SIS). The distributed CIT and BAT groups showed better performance in the overall and the distal part score of the FMA than the control group.</s><s>Chronic cerebrovascular accident individuals with partial paralysis in an upper extremity typically demonstrate difficulty in voluntarily controlling movement initiation. Twenty subjects were randomly assigned to either a unilateral movement/stimulation group or a bilateral movement/stimulation group. This robust analysis revealed higher EMG activation levels for the coupled bilateral movement/stimulation group than the unilateral movement/stimulation group. In addition, higher muscle activation levels were found for the second session block as well as trial blocks 2 and 3.</s><s>The use of activity-dependent interventions has shown some success in promoting recovery of upper limb function in chronic stroke patients. Twelve chronic stroke patients were randomly assigned to the two training protocols involving six daily practice sessions. Each session consisted of 50 trials of a dowel placement task performed either with both impaired and unimpaired arm moving synchronously (bilateral training group) or with only the impaired arm moving (unilateral training). Functional assessments of the impaired upper limb and neurophysiological assessments, using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), of the affected and non-affected cortical hemispheres were made prior to and following the intervention sessions. Overall, these findings suggest that a short-term bilateral training intervention may be effective in facilitating upper limb motor function in chronic stroke patients.</s><s>To compare the effects of bilateral task training with unilateral task training on upper-limb outcomes in early poststroke rehabilitation. A single-blinded randomized controlled trial, with outcome assessments at baseline, postintervention (6 wk), and follow-up (18 wk). Supervised bilateral or unilateral training for 20 minutes on weekdays over 6 weeks using a standardized program. For overall improvement (0-18 wk), the only significant between-group difference was a change in the 9HPT (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.0-0.1; P=.05) and ARAT pinch section (95% CI, 0.3-5.6; P=.03), which was lower for the bilateral training group. Bilateral training was no more effective than unilateral training, and in terms of overall improvement in dexterity, the bilateral training group improved significantly less.</s><s>Longitudinal studies have indicated that 30% to 66% of stroke survivors do not have full arm function 6 months poststroke. To date, no randomized, blinded study of efficacy comparing 2 groups (bilateral training vs unilateral training) using analogous tasks has been performed in chronic stroke survivors with moderate upper extremity impairment. Twenty-four subjects participated in a randomized, single-blind training study. The activities consisted of reaching-based tasks that were both rhythmic and discrete. The Motor Assessment Scale (MAS), Motor Status Scale (MSS), and muscle strength were used as outcome measures. Assessments were administered at baseline and posttraining by a rater blinded to group assignment. Both groups had significant improvements on the MSS and measures of strength.</s><s>The purpose was to determine the cumulative longitudinal effects of upper extremity distributed practice with variable treatment protocols involving EMG-triggered neuromuscular stimulation and coupled bilateral movements. Consistent across the orders and protocols, the participants completed 90 min of training per day for 4 days during separate 2-week rehabilitation periods. Data for the 5 primary outcome measures were analyzed in separate mixed design ANOVAs (treatment order x test session: 2 x 6). These chronic stroke patients displayed robust cumulative motor improvement effects from the longitudinally distributed practice of active neuromuscular stimulation and coupled bilateral movements.</s><s>Motor improvements in chronic stroke recovery accrue from coupled protocols of bilateral movements and active neuromuscular stimulation. Twenty-six volunteers completed one of three motor recovery protocols according to group assignments: (1) coupled bilateral involved concurrent wrist/finger movements on the unimpaired limb coupled with active stimulation on the impaired limb; (2) unilateral/active stimulation involved neuromuscular electromyogram-triggered stimulation on the impaired wrist/fingers; and (3) no protocol (control group). The coupled bilateral group showed positive intralimb transfer post-treatment when both arms moved simultaneously. During the posttest, the coupled bilateral group displayed improved movement time, higher peak limb velocity, less variability in peak velocity, and less percentage of total movement time in the deceleration phase than during the pretest. The evidence confirms that within-limb transfer from distal joint training to proximal joint combinations is viable and generalizable in chronic stroke rehabilitation.</s><s>To determine whether paretic arm reaching performance is improved in bilateral compared with unilateral conditions. A 2-way repeated-measures analysis of variance and Tukey-adjusted pairwise comparisons were used to analyze the results (alpha=.05). Nonparetic peak acceleration was higher (P=.015), velocity was unchanged, and movement time increased (P=.005) in the bilateral compared with the unilateral task. The addition of a weight to the nonparetic arm during bilateral reaching did not result in further improvement in paretic arm performance.</s>"

Sixty children were allocated to one of three groups: a sedative group (0.5 mg/kg oral midazolam), a PPIA group or a sedative and PPIA group. When anesthesia was induced with 7% sevoflurane in 100% oxygen, qualities of mask induction were rated. The children in the midazolam group showed a better quality of mask induction compared with those in the PPIA group, the addition of parental presence to oral midazolam did not provide additional improvement of mask induction. Parental presence during induction of anesthesia enhanced the effect of oral midazolam on emergence behavior of children undergoing general anesthesia.</s><s>In this study, we examined whether interactive music therapy is an effective treatment for preinduction anxiety. Children undergoing outpatient surgery were randomized to 3 groups: interactive music therapy (n = 51), oral midazolam (n = 34), or control (n = 38). An analysis controlling for therapist revealed a significant therapist effect; i.e., children treated by one of the therapists were significantly less anxious than children in the other therapist group and the control group on separation to the operating room (OR) (P < 0.05) and on entrance to the OR (P < 0.05), but not on the introduction of the anesthesia mask (P = not significant). We conclude that music therapy may be helpful on separation and entrance to the OR, depending on the therapist. However, music therapy does not appear to relieve anxiety during the induction of anesthesia.</s><s>Children and parents experience significant anxiety and distress during the preoperative period. Based on an integration of the literature in both the anesthesia and psychological milieus, the authors developed a behaviorally oriented perioperative preparation program for children undergoing surgery that targets the family as a whole. The authors assessed the effect of group assignment on preoperative anxiety levels and postoperative outcomes such as analgesic consumption and emergence delirium. Parents and children in the ADVANCE group exhibited significantly lower anxiety in the holding area as compared with all three other groups (34.4+/-16 vs. 39.7+/-15; P=0.007) and were less anxious during induction of anesthesia as compared with the control and parental presence groups (44.9+/-22 vs. 51.6+/-25 and 53.6+/-25, respectively; P=0.006).</s><s>We assessed the effectiveness of a behavioral intervention aimed at reducing the anxiety of children undergoing anesthesia and surgery. The intervention consisted of dimmed operating room (OR) lights (200 Lx) and soft background music (Bach's \"Air on a G String,\" 50-60 dB). Only one person, the attending anesthesiologist, interacted with the child during the induction of anesthesia. Children undergoing anesthesia and surgery were randomly assigned either to a low sensory stimulation group (LSSG, n = 33) or to control group (n = 37). By using validated behavioral measures of anxiety (mYPAS) and compliance (ICC), children were evaluated at the preoperative holding area and during the induction of anesthesia. The incidence of postoperative behavioral changes, however, did not differ significantly between the two groups (P = ns).</s><s>Although some anesthesiologists use oral sedatives or parental presence during induction of anesthesia (PPIA) to treat preoperative anxiety in children, others may use these interventions simultaneously (e.g., sedatives and PPIA). The child's and the parental anxiety throughout the perioperative period was the primary endpoint of the study. Subjects (n = 103) were assigned randomly to one of two groups: a sedative group (0.5 mg/kg oral midazolam) or a sedative and PPIA group. Using standardized measures of anxiety and satisfaction, the effects of the interventions on the children and parents were assessed. Parental anxiety after separation, however, was significantly lower in the sedative and PPIA group (F[2,93] = 4.46, P = 0.037). Parents who accompanied their children to the operating room, however, were less anxious and more satisfied.</s><s>Both midazolam and parental presence during induction of anesthesia are routinely used to treat preoperative anxiety in children. The purpose of this investigation was to determine which of these two interventions is more effective. Anxiety of the child during the perioperative period was the primary end point. Children (n = 88) were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (1) 0.5 mg/kg oral midazolam; (2) parental presence during induction of anesthesia; or (3) control (no parental presence or premedication). The percentage of inductions in which compliance of the child was poor was significantly greater in the control group compared with the parental-presence and midazolam groups (25% vs. 17% vs. 0%, P = 0.013). Under the conditions of this study, oral midazolam is more effective than either parental presence or no intervention for managing a child's and parent's anxiety during the preoperative period.</s><s>Fear and anxiety in a child undergoing surgery are correlated positively with the parent's level of anxiety, and interventions to decrease the parent's anxiety are appropriate. The purpose of this study was to determine whether viewing a video of an actual pediatric inhalation induction would reduce the level of parental anxiety. Parents in the control group (group 2; n = 40) received an information pamphlet only. Mean arterial pressure for children in group 1 was significantly lower during preoperative holding and following induction (P < .05).</s><s>To determine whether parental presence during induction of anesthesia is an effective preoperative behavioral intervention, a randomized controlled trial with children undergoing outpatient surgery was conducted. Eighty-four children were randomly assigned to a parent-present or parent-absent group. Using multiple behavioral and physiologic measures of anxiety, the effect of the intervention on the children and their parents was assessed. Analysis of variance demonstrated that three groups showed diminished cortisol concentrations with parental presence: children older than 4 yr (P = 0.001), children whose parent had a low trait anxiety (P = 0.02), and children who had a low baseline level of activity as assessed by temperament (P = 0.05).</s><s>Parental presence at induction of anaesthesia is desirable if it makes the child happier and more cooperative. The Global Mood Scale (GMS) was used to assess the child's behaviour and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) to assess the parent's anxiety on arrival for surgery and at induction of anaesthesia. All patients and parents were disturbed by the experience, but to the same degree in the treatment and control groups. Subgroups of \"calm\" and \"anxious\" parents were identified by a median split of their preoperative VAS scores. Preoperative parental anxiety levels also correlated with the child's fears and behaviour one week after surgery.</s><s>The purpose of this study was to determine whether parental auricular acupuncture reduces parental preoperative anxiety and thus allows children to benefit from parental presence during induction of anesthesia. The behavioral and physiologic anxiety of mothers and children were rated during the perioperative process. A multivariate model (F1,65 = 4.8, P =0.031) also showed that children whose mothers received the acupuncture intervention were significantly less anxious on entrance to the operating room (34.9 +/- 20 vs. 47.4 +/- 26; P = 0.03) and during introduction of the anesthesia mask (38.6 +/- 25 vs. 55.6 +/- 31; P = 0.016). There were no significant differences in maternal blood pressure and heart rate between the two groups. : Auricular acupuncture significantly decreased maternal anxiety during the preoperative period.</s><s>Video games have received widespread application in health care for distraction and behavior modification therapy. In a randomized, prospective study of 112 children aged 4-12 years undergoing outpatient surgery, anxiety was assessed after admission and again at mask induction of anesthesia, using the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale (mYPAS). Patients were randomly assigned to three groups: parent presence (PP), PP+a hand-held VG, and PP+0.5 mg.kg-1 oral midazolam (M) given>20 min prior to entering the operating room. Sixty-three percent of patients in VG group had no change or decrease in anxiety after treatment, compared with 26% in M group and 28% in PP group (P=0.01). There was no difference in anxiety changes between female and male patients. Distraction in a pleasurable and familiar activity provides anxiety relief, probably through cognitive and motor absorption.</s><s>We conducted a randomized controlled trial of parental presence during anaesthesia induction for outpatient surgery in 73 infants (aged 1-12 months). Effects of parental presence on infant and parental outcomes, including anxiety, health care attitudes and satisfaction with the anaesthesia and surgery experience were evaluated. We discuss reasons for the lack of treatment effects from parental presence, and new directions for future research to identify subgroups of children who may most benefit from the opportunity to have parents involved in the perioperative period.</s><s>The purpose of this study was to determine whether audiovisual information, describing the process of undergoing and recovering from anesthesia, could reduce anxiety levels in parents before their child's induction of anesthesia. Of these 56 were randomized to a control group and 55 to an intervention group. In addition to the normal preoperative preparation, parents randomized into the study group watched a short 8-min information video after completing the first questionnaire. Furthermore, the reduction in need for information score in the intervention group indicates that preoperative videos may be a useful tool for providing parents with information.</s><s>The authors conducted a randomized controlled trial to determine whether parental presence during induction of anesthesia (PPIA) is associated with parental physiologic and behavioral manifestations of stress. The effect of the group assignment on parental heart rate (HR), parental blood pressure, and parental skin conductance level (SCL) were assessed. That is, throughout the induction period there were several time points at which parents in the two PPIA groups had a significantly higher HR than did parents in the control group (P < 0.05). Similarly, SCL was found to increase in all parents from baseline until induction of anesthesia (P = 0.001). Significant group differences in SCL changes over time were found as well (P = 0.009).</s><s>The main objectives of premedication in children are to facilitate the separation from the parents, to reduce preoperative anxiety, to smooth the induction of anesthesia and to lower the risk of postoperative behavioral disorders. Hypnosis enables a state of relaxation to be achieved and has never been evaluated as a premedication technique. Preoperative anxiety was evaluated using the Modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale (mYPAS) score when arriving in the department (T1), when entering the operating room (T2), and when fitting the facemask (T3). Postoperatively, hypnosis reduced the frequency of behavior disorders approximately by half on day 1 (30% vs 62%) and day 7 (26% vs 59%). Hypnosis seems effective as premedication in children scheduled for surgery. It alleviates preoperative anxiety, especially during induction of anesthesia and reduces behavioral disorders during the first postoperative week.</s><s>The induction of anesthesia is one of the most stressful moments for a child who must undergo surgery: it is estimated that 60% of children suffer anxiety in the preoperative period. Preoperative anxiety is characterized by subjective feelings of tension, apprehension, nervousness, and worry. These reactions reflect the child's fear of separation from parents and home environment, as well as of loss of control, unfamiliar routines, surgical instruments, and hospital procedures. Both behavioral and pharmacologic interventions are available to treat preoperative anxiety in children. The sample was composed of 40 subjects (5-12 years of age) who had to undergo minor day surgery and were assigned randomly to the clown group (N = 20), in which the children were accompanied in the preoperative room by the clowns and a parent, or the control group (N = 20), in which the children were accompanied by only 1 of his/her parents. In addition, a questionnaire for health professionals was developed to obtain their opinion about the presence of clowns during the induction of anesthesia, and a self-evaluation form was developed to be filled out by the clowns themselves about their interactions with the child. The questionnaire for health professionals indicated that the clowns were a benefit to the child, but the majority of the staff was opposed to continuing the program because of perceived interference with the procedures of the operating room.</s><s>The aim of this study was to establish the efficacy of two different preparation packages, a paper-based cartoon and an interactive computer, at facilitating coping behavior in children undergoing dental general anesthetic (DGA) tooth extraction. A total of 198 children were allocated randomly to computer, cartoon or control groups. Blinded observers then scored behavior at both anesthesia induction and upon recovery using a VAS for each (0 = coped/no distress and 10 = no coping/high distress). Preoperative anxiety was similar for all preparation groups; with 24% of all children categorized 'phobic' using MCDAS. The median induction (coping) VAS level for both the computer and the cartoon groups was '1' (range 0-10), compared with the control group level of '3' (range 0-10). The computer preparation package facilitated coping behavior in children undergoing DGA induction.</s>"

A total of 135 patients with HD were randomized to enter a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial on the efficacy of 2 g/d ethyl-EPA vs placebo. The Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) was used for assessment. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and a chi2 test on response, defined as absence of increase in the TMS-4, were performed. A total of 121 patients completed 12 months, and 83 did so without protocol violations (PP cohort). Ethyl-eicosapentaenoate (ethyl-EPA) (purity > 95%) had no benefit in the intent-to-treat cohort of patients with Huntington disease, but exploratory analysis revealed that a significantly higher number of patients in the per protocol cohort, treated with ethyl-EPA, showed stable or improved motor function.</s><s>To evaluate the effect of creatine (Cr) supplementation (5 g/day) in Huntington's disease (HD). A 1-year double-blind placebo-controlled study was performed in 41 patients with HD (stage I through III). At baseline and after 6 and 12 months, the functional, neuromuscular, and cognitive status of the patients was assessed by a test battery that consisted of 1) the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS), 2) an exercise test on an isokinetic dynamometer to assess strength of the elbow flexor muscles, 3) a maximal exercise test on a bicycle ergometer to evaluate cardiorespiratory fitness, and 4) a test to assess bimanual coordination ability.

Secondary response variables included the quantified neurological examination and a set of cognitive and motor tests. Repeated fluorodeoxyglucose measurements of regional cerebral metabolism using PET also were included. Neither the primary response variable nor any of the secondary response variables differed significantly between the treatment groups. However, more patients on lamotrigine reported symptomatic improvement (53.6 versus 14.8%; p = 0.006), and a trend toward decreased chorea was evident in the treated group (p = 0.08).</s><s>One hundred patients with clinically diagnosed Huntington's disease (HD) were randomized to either idebenone, an antioxidant and enhancer of oxidative metabolism, or placebo, in a 1-year, double-blind, parallel-group study aimed at slowing the rate of progression of the disease. Sample size calculations based on progression of the ADL and QNE in this study group revealed that a larger study group is necessary to detect any differences less than an almost complete halting of the disease.</s><s>Evidence suggests that the neuropathology of Huntington's disease, a neuropsychiatric disorder due to a mutation on chromosome 4, results from excessive activation of glutamate-gated ion channels, which kills neurons by oxidative stress. Therefore, the authors hypothesized that alpha-tocopherol, which reduces oxyradical damage to cell membranes, might slow the course of Huntington's disease. A prospective, double-blind; placebo-controlled study of high-dose d-alpha-tocopherol treatment was carried out with a cohort of 73 patients with Huntington's disease who were randomly assigned to either d-alpha-tocopherol or placebo. Treatment with d-alpha-tocopherol had no effect on neurologic and neuropsychiatric symptoms in the treatment group overall.</s><s>We carried out a controlled clinical trial to examine the potential of baclofen to slow the functional decline of patients with early Huntington's disease (HD). The basis of the trial was: (1) the hypothesis that excitatory amino acid neurotransmission mediates the neuronal degeneration of HD, (2) preclinical evidence that baclofen retards corticostriatal release of glutamate and aspartate, and (3) reports that baclofen produces short-term clinical benefits in some HD patients.

Despite adequate dosage, the incidence of complete and partial remission was low (10% vs 20%) and not superior to that usually obtained with single agent chemotherapy. By adding objective improvement, the over all response rate was 47% and 26%, respectively.

The median duration of response was 5.5 months for CBDCA and 6 months for CHIP; the median survival was 7.5 and 7.6 months, respectively. Both drugs were given in an outpatient setting and myelosuppression (thrombocytopenia) was the predominant toxicity.</s><s>The Gynecologic Oncology Group has conducted a randomized prospective trial comparing cisplatin 50 mg/m2 every 21 days (regimen 1), 100 mg/m2 every 21 days (regimen 2), and cisplatin 20 mg/m2 for five consecutive days repeated every 21 days (regimen 3). Four hundred ninety-seven evaluable patients have been accrued on this study. The response rates were 20.7%, 31.4%, and 25.0%, for regimens 1, 2, and 3, respectively; the complete remission rates were 10.0%, 12.7%, and 8.6% for regimens 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The regimen consisting of a 100-mg/m2 single dose has produced a statistically significant higher response rate than the 50 mg/m2 regimen while producing no appreciable differences in complete remission rate, response duration, progression-free interval, or survival. In addition, the higher dose regimen was associated with greater myelosuppression and nephrotoxicity.</s><s>Comparison of the therapeutic effects of adriamycin alone versus adriamycin plus vincristine versus adriamycin plus cyclophosphamide in the treatment of advanced carcinoma of the cervix.</s><s>Thirty-five patients with epithelial carcinomas not considered to be surgically resectable were randomized to receive two different chemotherapy regimens. Three of 15 patients treated with the four-drug combination had a partial response. Most importantly, the two-drug regimen is well tolerated as an outpatient procedure.

The number of months from diagnosis to the start of chemotherapy (p = 0.04) and the patients' response status (p = 0.002) did however have significant effects on survival time. Hexamethylmelamine had a greater frequency of severe toxicity (50%, 10/20) than Adriamycin (10.5%, 2/19) (p = 0.014) and Cytoxan (10%, 2/10) (p = 0.014).</s><s>Cisplatin, mitolactol (dibromodulcitol), and ifosfamide have been the most active single agents in squamous carcinoma of the cervix identified so far by the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG). Of 454 patients entered, 438 were eligible and analyzed for response and survival. The median times to progression or death were 4.6 and 3.2 months, respectively. C + M showed no significant improvement in these parameters compared with cisplatin alone. There was no significant difference in overall survival between cisplatin and either of the combinations.</s><s>Chemotherapy can profoundly affect patients' quality of life (QOL), yet few clinical trials in advanced cervical cancer have included QOL outcomes. Our purpose was to assess the impact of cisplatin (C) versus cisplatin plus paclitaxel (CP) on overall QOL and pain in cervical cancer patients. Overall (FACT-G) scores did not differ significantly between arms at the fourth assessment (C = 70.3 (19.6); CP = 72.8 (17.4)). Scores were stable over time and considerably lower than the general population norms. The BPI-SF revealed a decline in pain scores in both arms from the first to fourth assessments. At the fourth time point, 60% of living patients in both arms completed a QOL assessment.

Hematologic toxicity was dose-limiting, among which thrombocytopenia was slightly more common than leukopenia. Renal, otic, and peripheral nervous system toxicities were absent or infrequent with both analogs. The percentage of planned dosages that were actually administered was 100% of carboplatin doses and 85% of iproplatin doses (P less than .0001). The reduction in iproplatin dose was apparently due to gastrointestinal toxicity. Response rates were similar for both agents (15% for carboplatin, 11% for iproplatin) and appear to be inferior to those noted with the parent compound, cisplatin.</s><s>Phase II trial reports have suggested that the addition of bleomycin to the combination of cisplatin and ifosfamide may improve response rates and possible survival in squamous carcinoma of the cervix.

Twenty-seven eligible patients were assigned to receive didemnin B at either 2.6 mg/m2 iv every 28 days (sixteen patients) or at 5.6 mg/m2 (eleven patients). Toxicity for trimetrexate included nausea and vomiting (69%), leukopenia (51%), mild thrombocytopenia (38%), anemia (63%), and diarrhea (31%).

One hundred eighty-six patients (C = 60; TC = 63; MVAC = 63) were enrolled before MVAC was closed by the GOG Data Safety Monitoring Board after four treatment-related deaths occurred on that arm. MVAC produced a 22% overall response rate (95% CI: 0.13 to 0.34) and median PFS and OS of 4.4 months and 9.4 months, respectively.

Twenty-four patients were included, 3 of which not eligible, and of the remaining 21 patients, 11 were randomized to the cisplatin group and 10 to the PIF group. The most important side effects were hematologic, with more thrombocytopenia and leukopenia in the PIF regimen. The response rate for the PIF regimen was 40% (4 partial remissions) and 9% for the cisplatin group (1 complete remission). No firm conclusions can be drawn from this trial due to the low number of participants.</s><s>We undertook a randomized phase II trial to test whether the addition of paclitaxel (Taxol) to the cisplatin and ifosfamide (IP) combination could improve objective response (OR) rate, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with recurrent or metastatic cancer of the uterine cervix.

The purpose of this non-inferiority study was to compare the speed of onset of antidepressant efficacy for duloxetine (a dual serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) and escitalopram (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor). This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active comparator-controlled study, in which patients (> or = 18 years) meeting DSM-IV criteria for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) received duloxetine 60 mg once daily (QD; N = 273), escitalopram 10 mg QD (N = 274), or placebo (N = 137) for 8 weeks. Adverse events that occurred significantly more frequently among duloxetine-treated patients when compared with those receiving escitalopram were nausea, dry mouth, vomiting, yawning, and irritability. The rate of discontinuation due to adverse events did not differ significantly between treatment groups. Given the difficulties in constructing appropriate dose comparisons, the results of this study should be interpreted specific to the doses tested and not extrapolated to the drug as a whole. In this study, both duloxetine and escitalopram showed significantly greater improvement on the primary efficacy measure than placebo over the 8-week acute treatment period, while no differences were observed between drugs or between drugs and placebo on response and remission rates at 8 weeks. Escitalopram at a starting dose of 10 mg QD was better tolerated than duloxetine at a starting dose of 60 mg QD.</s><s>Escitalopram is the most selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant; in contrast, duloxetine inhibits both serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. A 1-week, single-blind, placebo lead-in period followed by an 8-week, randomised, double-blind, multicentre, parallel-group comparison was conducted from 20 April 2005 to 10 March 2006 in independent psychiatric research facilities with principal investigators who were board certified in psychiatry. Eight patients received no medication and were excluded from the safety group. Patients were treated with either escitalopram 10-20 mg/day (fixed at 10 mg/day for the first 4 weeks) or duloxetine 60 mg/day. The primary efficacy variable was change from baseline at week 8 in MADRS total score using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach. A significantly greater proportion of escitalopram-treated patients completed the 8-week study compared with duloxetine-treated patients (87% vs 69%, respectively; p < 0.01). There was no difference between treatment groups in the observed cases (OC) analysis (LSMD -0.32; 95% CI -2.71, 2.07; p = 0.79). These findings suggest that escitalopram is better tolerated and at least as effective as the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor duloxetine in the treatment of major depressive disorder.</s><s>Clinical trials assessing antidepressant therapies typically include separate assessments of efficacy (benefit) and adverse events (risk). The objective was to compare the serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) duloxetine and venlafaxine using GBR assessment. Data were combined from two similarly designed, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group studies in which patients with major depressive disorder were randomized to either duloxetine 60 mg/day or venlafaxine extended release (XR) 150 mg/day (75 mg/day for the first 2 weeks) for a 6-week fixed dosing period followed by an additional 6 weeks of treatment in which the dose could be increased up to 120 mg/day for duloxetine and 225 mg/day for venlafaxine. Patients completing the study (or receiving study drug for 2 weeks or more) were eligible to enter a taper period where the dose of study drug was gradually reduced over 1-2 weeks prior to drug discontinuation. Safety and tolerability were assessed via analysis of reasons for discontinuation, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), discontinuation-emergent adverse events, and changes in vital signs, weight, and laboratory analytes. Significantly more venlafaxine-treated patients (74.5%) completed 12 weeks of treatment compared with duloxetine-treated patients (64.8%, P =.006). During the taper period, significantly more venlafaxine-treated patients reported discontinuation-emergent adverse events (DEAEs) than duloxetine-treated patients. Duloxetine 60 mg/day and venlafaxine XR 150 mg/day have similar benefit-risk profiles on the basis of a comparison utilizing GBR assessment. The implications of the more subtle differences between these drugs, as well as for interpreting the GBR assessment, are discussed.</s><s>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common, chronic illness associated with substantial disability and economic burden. This was an 8-week, Phase III, randomized, double-blind, duloxetine-referenced, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial conducted in 21 centers across the United States. Duloxetine was included for assay sensitivity as a positive control; the study was not designed or powered to compare desvenlafaxine with duloxetine. The primary outcome measure was HAM-D(17) total score at the final evaluation. Tolerability assessments included discontinuation rates, adverse events (AEs), vital signs, and laboratory tests. The post hoc pooled analysis was performed using data from the current study and 2 previously published, positive studies that compared the efficacy and tolerability of desvenlafaxine 50 and 100 mg/d with placebo for MDD. The design and methodologies of the 2 studies were similar to the methodology of the current trial, other than not including a reference compound. Of the 925 patients who were screened, 287 did not meet entry criteria, and 638 patients enrolled in the study; the intent-to-treat (ITT) population included 615 patients who were evaluated for efficacy (mean [SD] age range, 38.8-40.7 [12.1-13.2] years; mean weight range, 83.3-87.0 [22.8-23.9] kg; female sex, 398 [64.7%]; white race, 458 [74.5%]). The primary end point did not reach significance based on the global F test for controlling multiplicity of the desvenlafaxine doses. Based on pairwise comparison, significantly greater improvements on the HAM-D(17) were observed in the desven-lafaxine 100 mg/d (-10.5; P = 0.028, unadjusted for multiple comparisons) and duloxetine 60 mg/d groups (-10.3; P = 0.047) compared with placebo (-8.7). No significant differences were observed in any scale between the desvenlafaxine 50 mg/d and placebo groups. Both doses were significantly better than placebo on the CGI-I, MADRS, and HAM-D(6).</s><s>The aim of the present paper was to compare the efficacy and safety of duloxetine with paroxetine in the acute treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Secondary efficacy measures included the HAMD(17) subscales, Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety, Clinical Global Impressions-Severity, Patient Global Impressions-Improvement, Somatic Symptoms Inventory and Visual Analog Scales (VAS) for pain. Non-inferiority of duloxetine to paroxetine was demonstrated because the upper bound of the confidence interval for mean difference in HAMD(17) change (0.71) was less than the non-inferiority margin. No significant differences were observed in the number of early discontinuations and overall TEAE. No clinically relevant changes in laboratory values, vital signs, weight or electrocardiograms were observed with either treatment.</s><s>Duloxetine doses of 80 and 120 mg/day were assessed for efficacy and safety in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). In this randomized, double-blind trial, patients age > or =18 meeting DSM-IV criteria for MDD were randomized to placebo (N=99), duloxetine 80 mg/day (N=93), duloxetine 120 mg/day (N=103), or paroxetine 20 mg/day (N=97). Patients who had a > or =30% reduction from baseline in the HAMD(17) total score at the end of the acute phase entered a 6-month continuation phase where they remained on the same treatment as they had taken during the acute phase; efficacy and safety/tolerability outcomes were assessed during continuation treatment. More than 87% of patients completed the acute phase in each treatment group. Duloxetine-treated patients (both doses) showed significantly greater improvement (P<0.05) in the HAMD(17) total score at week 8 compared with placebo. HAMD(17) mean change data from this study and an identical sister study were pooled as defined a priori for the purposes of performing a non-inferiority test versus paroxetine. Both duloxetine doses met statistical criteria for non-inferiority to paroxetine.</s><s>Duloxetine hydrochloride, a dual reuptake inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine, was evaluated for therapeutic efficacy and safety/tolerability in the treatment of major depression. In an 8-week multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 173 patients (aged 18-65 years) with DSM-IV major depressive disorder were randomly allocated to receive placebo (N = 70), duloxetine (N = 70), or fluoxetine, 20 mg q.d. Safety was evaluated by recording the occurrence of discontinuation rates and treatment-emergent adverse events and by measurement of vital signs and laboratory analytes. In general, duloxetine was well tolerated; 76% of patients achieved the maximum dose, and insomnia and asthenia were the only adverse events reported statistically significantly (p < .05) more frequently by duloxetine-treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients. These data indicate that duloxetine is efficacious for the treatment of major depressive disorder and is well tolerated and safe.</s><s>To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of once-daily extended release quetiapine fumarate (quetiapine XR) as monotherapy treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). This 8-week (6-week active-treatment, randomized phase; 2-week posttreatment drug-discontinuation/tapering phase), multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, placebo- and active-controlled, phase 3 study was conducted between April 2006 and May 2007. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to week 6 in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score. Response rates (>or= 50% reduction in MADRS total score) at week 6 were significantly higher for both doses of quetiapine XR (p < .01) and duloxetine (p < .05) versus placebo. The most common adverse events reported were dry mouth, sedation, and somnolence for quetiapine XR and nausea, headache, dizziness, and dry mouth for duloxetine.</s><s>Duloxetine is a balanced and potent dual reuptake inhibitor of serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) that has previously been shown to be effective in the acute treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, adult outpatients (age >or= 18 years) meeting DSM-IV criteria for MDD received placebo (n = 93), duloxetine 80 mg/day (40 mg BID; n = 95), duloxetine 120 mg/day (60 mg BID; n = 93), or paroxetine (20 mg QD; n = 86) for 8 weeks. Patients who had a >or= 30% reduction from baseline in HAMD(17) total score during the acute phase were allowed to continue on the same (blinded) treatment for a 6-month continuation phase. Efficacy measures included the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD(17)) total score, HAMD(17) subscales, the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA), Visual Analog Scales (VAS) for pain, the Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) and Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) scales, the 28-item Somatic Symptom Inventory (SSI), and the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS). Both duloxetine (80 and 120 mg/day) and paroxetine treatment groups had significantly greater improvement, compared with placebo, in MADRS, HAMA, CGI-S, and PGI-I scales. The rate of discontinuation due to adverse events among duloxetine-treated patients (80 and 120 mg/day) did not differ significantly from the rate in the placebo group. Treatment-emergent adverse events reported significantly more frequently by duloxetine-treated patients than by patients receiving placebo were constipation (80 and 120 mg/day), increased sweating (120 mg/day), and somnolence (120 mg/day). During the 6-month continuation phase, duloxetine (80 and 120 mg/day) and paroxetine treatment groups demonstrated significant improvement in HAMD(17) total score. These data support previous findings that duloxetine is safe, efficacious, and well tolerated in the acute treatment of MDD.</s><s>This study evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of escitalopram and duloxetine in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Patients were randomised to 24 weeks of double-blind treatment with fixed doses of escitalopram (20 mg) (n = 143) or duloxetine (60 mg) (n = 151). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES;\n                At week 8, the mean change from baseline in total MADRS score was -19.5 for patients treated with escitalopram (n = 141) and -17.4 for patients treated with duloxetine (n = 146), a difference of 2.1 points (p < 0.05). For the primary endpoint, the mean change from baseline in total MADRS score at week 24 was -23.4 for patients treated with escitalopram and -21.7 for patients treated with duloxetine, a difference of 1.7 points (p = 0.055, one-sided).

        "Abstracts": "<s>The level of microalbuminuria is thought to reflect the severity of inflammation-induced systemic vascular permeability and may have prognostic value with regard to organ dysfunction and survival. The present study investigated the effect of early treatment with NAC on microalbuminuria and organ dysfunction in severe clinical sepsis. Thirty-five patients included within 4 h of fulfilling consensus criteria of severe sepsis. Urine samples for measurement of microalbuminuria/creatinine ratio (MACR) were collected on inclusion and after 4 h, 24 h, and 48 h. Severity of illness and degree of organ failure were determined by using, respectively, the APACHE (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation) II score and the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score. The MACR did not differ over time between the placebo- and the NAC-treated groups. NAC treatment even aggravated sepsis-induced organ failure, in particular cardiovascular failure.</s><s>To investigate whether prolonged infusion of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) that is commenced immediately after admission to the intensive care unit could ameliorate the development or progression of multisystem organ failure and improve mortality. After randomization, the treatment group (n = 41) received NAC (150 mg/kg bolus followed by a continuous infusion of 12 mg/kg/hr) and the placebo group (n = 45) received 5% dextrose, from a minimum of 3 days up to a maximum of 5 days. By splitting the groups with this median value, the effect of NAC was examined on patients admitted within 24 hrs and after 24 hrs of arrival to the hospital. Patients admitted after 24 hrs of hospital admission had a significantly worse mortality in the NAC-treated group (61% vs. 32% for controls; p = .05).</s><s>We have investigated the effect of N-acetylcysteine on hemodynamic variables, oxygen delivery (DO2), oxygen consumption (VO2), and oxygen extraction in patients with fulminant hepatic failure using independent methods of determining DO2 and VO2, thereby eliminating the effect of mathematical coupling, which may have biased previous studies. In 11 patients with severe fulminant hepatic failure, we documented the hemodynamic effects of N-acetylcysteine during the first 5 hours of a standard infusion regime and simultaneously measured VO2 using a method based on respiratory gas analysis. We related physiological changes to plasma N-acetylcysteine concentrations, and compared this group with 7 patients who received placebo infusions. The most significant relationship observed between DO2 and VO2 in any patient predicted a 13-mL x min(-1) x m(-2) increase in VO2 when DO2 increased by 100 mL x min(-1) x m(-2); in 8 patients, VO2 was independent of DO2 over the range observed. N-Acetylcysteine infusion did not increase oxygen extraction or result in an improvement in whole-blood lactate levels or base excess during the study period.</s><s>Oxidative stress has a proven role in pathophysiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Evaluation of three isoforms of glutathione-S-transferase (GST M1, P1 and T1), in these patients have showed an association between GST M1 null, and GST M1 and T1 double null polymorphisms with increased mortality in control group, suggesting antioxidant therapy critical for this group of patients.</s><s>To assess the effect of high-dose N-acetylcysteine on renal function in cardiac surgery patients at higher risk of postoperative renal failure. A total of 60 cardiac surgery patients at higher risk of postoperative renal failure. Patients were allocated to either 24 hrs of high-dose N-acetylcysteine infusion (300 mg/kg body weight in 5% glucose, 1.7 L) or placebo (5% glucose, 1.7 L). Randomization was successful and patients were well balanced for preoperative and intraoperative characteristics. Also, there was no attenuation in the increase in serum cystatin C from baseline to peak for N-acetylcysteine compared with placebo (0.45 +/- 0.43 and 0.30 +/- 0.33 mg/L, respectively; p = .40). Likewise, there was no evidence for differences in any other clinical outcome.</s><s>The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of continuously infused N-acetyl-L-cystein (NAC) on serum cytokine levels and gastric intramucosal pH in humans suffering from severe sepsis. In the NAC group (n = 27), after an initial intravenous bolus of NAC (150 mg/kg over 5 min), a continuous intravenous infusion of 12.5 mg/kg per hour was given for 6 hours. All measurements were taken at baseline (15 min before the start of the study) and were repeated immediately after the bolus infusion, and at 24 and 48 hours after initiation of the continuous NAC infusion. No differences were found between groups in levels of the major cytokines, duration of ventilation and intensive care unit stay, gastric intramucosal pH and arterial oxygen tension/inspired fractional oxygen ratio (P > 0.05). However, our results do not support the use of NAC in patients with severe sepsis.</s><s>To investigate the effect of N-acetylcysteine on preventing pump-induced oxidoinflammatory response during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Forty patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) were randomly divided into a study group (n = 20), given 50 mg kg(-1) N-acetylcysteine intravenously for 3 days, and a control group (n = 20) given saline. The MPO and MDA values showed a similar pattern during and after CPB in the study group, with significantly less variance than in the control group.</s><s>Deactivation of endothelium-derived relaxing factor due to an increased oxygen radical load during sepsis may contribute to an impairment in microcirculatory blood flow. Fifty-eight patients requiring hemodynamic monitoring (radial and pulmonary artery catheters) due to septic shock, were included in this study. Infusion measurements were begun 60 mins after the beginning of infusion and lasted approximately 30 mins. The infusion was then discontinued and 2 hrs later the final measurements were taken. The N-acetylcysteine nonresponders, as well as the patients in the placebo group, did not show any significant changes in any of these variables. The only significant difference between the entire N-acetylcysteine group (which included responders plus nonresponders) and the placebo group was an increased VO2 in the entire N-acetylcysteine group during infusion measurements. N-acetylcysteine provided a transient improvement in tissue oxygenation in about half of the septic shock patients, as indicated by an increase in VO2 and gastric intramucosal pH and a decrease in veno-arterial PCO2. The higher survival rate in the N-acetylcysteine responders and the fact that half of the patients receiving N-acetylcysteine did not respond, suggests that, in some patients, sepsis irreversibly damages the microvasculature to the extent that N-acetylcysteine has no effect.</s><s>To assess the effects of adjunctive treatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) on hemodynamics, oxygen transport variables, and plasma levels of cytokines in patients with septic shock. Plasma concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, and soluble tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor-p55 (sTNFR-p55) were measured by sensitive immunoassays at 0, 2, 4, 6 and 24 h. Pulmonary artery catheter-derived hemodynamics, blood gases, hemoglobin, and arterial lactate were measured at baseline, after infusion (4 h), and at 24 h.\n                NAC improved oxygenation (PaO2/FIO2 ratio, 214+/-97 vs 123+/-86; p<0.05) and static lung compliance (44+/-11 vs 31+/-6 L/cm H2O; p<0.05) at 24 h. NAC had no significant effects on plasma TNF, IL-6, or IL-10 levels, but acutely decreased IL-8 and sTNFR-p55 levels. The administration of NAC had no significant effect on systemic and pulmonary hemodynamics, oxygen delivery, and oxygen consumption. In this small cohort of patients with early septic shock, short-term IV infusion of NAC was well-tolerated, improved respiratory function, and shortened ICU stay in survivors.</s><s>Hyperoxic ventilation, used to prevent hypoxia during potential periods of hypoventilation, has been reported to paradoxically decrease whole-body oxygen consumption (VO2). All patients exhibited stable clinical conditions (hemodynamics, body temperature, hemoglobin, F1O2 < 0.5). Cardiac output was determined by thermodilution and VO2 by cardiovascular Fick. Measurements were repeated 30 min after starting NAC or placebo infusion, 30 min after starting hyperoxia (F1O2 = 1.0), and 30 min after resetting the original F1O2. There were no significant differences between groups in any of the measurements before treatment and after the return to baseline F1O2 at the end of the study, respectively. ST segment depression ( > 0.2 mV) was significantly less marked in the NAC group (NAC: -0.02 +/- 0.17 vs placebo: -0.23 +/- 0.15; P < or = 0.05). NAC helped preserve VO2, oxygen delivery, CI, LVSWI and PvaCO2 during brief hyperoxia in cardiac risk patients. Clinical signs of myocardial ischemia did not occur such as ST-depression if patients were prophylactically treated with NAC. This suggests that pretreatment with NAC could be considered to attenuate impaired tissue oxygenation and to preserve myocardial performance better in cardiac risk patients during hyperoxia.</s><s>N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an antioxidant agent which has been shown to benefit patients with fulminant hepatic failure. We have examined its effect in patients with chronic liver disease undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation by giving NAC during operation.</s><s>The release of toxic oxidative free radicals induced by ischemia and reperfusion may jeopardize liver graft function. NAC improves hemodynamics and survival rates in patients with fulminant hepatic failure. Sixty patients with chronic end-stage liver disease were included in a prospective randomized placebo-controlled study. Hemodynamic data and calculated tissue oxygenation parameters were compared throughout the procedure. Postoperative graft function was comparable within the 3 first postoperative days. This study failed to show any beneficial effect of the intraoperative administration of NAC on hemodynamics and graft function in liver transplantation in patients with chronic liver disease.</s><s>N-acetylcysteine in critically ill patients undergoing contrast-enhanced computed tomography: a randomized trial.</s><s>Study of leukocyte activation and release of toxic mediators during extracorporeal circulation (ECC). Clinical studies have indicated that N-acetylcysteine (NAC) may improve systemic oxygenation and reduce the need for ventilatory support when given to patients with acute lung injury. Cardiac surgery patients were pretreated with high-dose NAC in order to assess the potential role of NAC to interfere with neutrophil-mediated inflammation and lung injury. 18 patients who underwent ECC: group 1 (n = 8) no premedication (only placebo); group 2 (n = 10) NAC (72 mg/kg i.v. NAC pretreatment prevented an increase in plasma neutrophil elastase activity (18.9 +/- 6.9 vs 49.9 +/- 5.6 ng/ml in group 1 at the end of ECC; p = 0.027). There were no significant difference in cellular composition and mediators in the lavage fluid, although values for total number of neutrophils, elastase, MPO and interleukin-8 were lower in group 2. Pretreatment with NAC may prevent lung injury by diminishing elastase activity.</s><s>The role of N-acetylcystein (NAC) administration on the oxidative response of neutrophils during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was evaluated in a double-blind study. Twenty-four adult patients undergoing coronary artery bypass were included in the study. Citrated blood samples for measurement of oxidative burst response of neutrophils were obtained at different time points during bypass. The oxidative burst response of neutrophils in the patients receiving NAC was significantly low at all times during bypass.</s><s>The aim of our study was to assess effect of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on oxidative stress, inflammation, fluid requirement, multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) score and vasoactive drug requirement. In this study 15 patients were on standard therapy, whereas for other 15 patients NAC was supplemented. Blood samples were taken on admission and on the next five consecutive mornings. NAC treatment increased GSH level on days 4-5 (p<0.05) and PSH level on days 2-6 (p<0.05) compared to controls.</s><s>To determine the effects of intravenous N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on the development of severe adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and mortality rate in patients with mild-to-moderate acute lung injury and to analyze the duration of ventilatory support and FIO2 required as well as the evolution of the lung injury score. Respiratory dysfunction was assessed daily according to the need for mechanical ventilation and FIO2, the evolution of the lung injury score, and the PaO2/FIO2 ratio. The cardiovascular state, liver function, and kidney function were also monitored. At the end of the treatment period (day 3), 5 of 29 (17 percent) in the NAC group and 12 of 25 (48 percent) in the placebo group were still receiving ventilatory support (p = 0.01), The FIO2 was 0.37 less than admission value (day 0) in the NAC group, and 0.20 less in the placebo group (p < 0.04); the oxygenation index (PaO2/FIO2) improved significantly (p < 0.05) from day 0 to day 3 only in the NAC-treated group. Intravenous NAC treatment during 72 h improved systemic oxygenation and reduced the need for ventilatory support in patients presenting with mild-to-moderate acute lung injury subsequent to a variety of underlying diseases. Development of ARDS and mortality were not reduced significantly by this therapy.</s><s>In septic shock, decreased splanchnic blood flow is reported, despite adequate systemic hemodynamics. Aacetylcysteine (NAC) was found to increase hepatosplanchnic blood flow in experimental settings. Septic shock patients admitted to an interdisciplinary surgical intensive care unit. Microsomal liver function was assessed by using the plasma appearance of monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX). Measurements were performed before (baseline) and 60 mins after beginning the infusion (infusion). The difference between arterial and gastric mucosal carbon dioxide tension decreased (p = .05) and MEGX increased (p = .04). After NAC treatment, hepatosplanchnic flow and function improved and may, therefore, suggest enhanced nutritive blood flow. Because of its correlation with liver blood flow index, MEGX may be helpful in identifying patients who benefit from NAC treatment in early septic shock.</s><s>In this prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial we studied the effects of IV N-acetylcysteine for prevention of renal injury in patients undergoing abdominal aortic surgery. Renal function was assessed by measuring plasma creatinine and serum cystatin C concentrations. The urinary NAG/creatinine ratio increased significantly from baseline to before crossclamp and remained increased on day 5 in both groups. However, the changes in the NAG/creatinine ratio and the albumin/creatinine ratio were not significantly different between the two groups.</s><s>Intravenous N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been reported to improve systemic oxygenation and reduce the need for ventilatory support in patients with an acute lung injury. Respiratory dysfunction was graded daily according to the need for mechanical ventilation and FIO2 and to the evolution of the lung injury score (LIS) and the PaO2/FIO2 ratio in 42 patients with established ARDS receiving either NAC 190 mg/kg/day or placebo as a continuous intravenous infusion over the first 3 days of their clinical course. Mortality rate was 32% for the NAC and 25% for the placebo group (difference not significant). Moreover, there were no differences between the two groups at the same observation days. In both groups, the FIO2 was significantly lower and the PaO2/FIO2 ratio was significantly higher than the initial values during the evolution (FiO2 at day 3, P < .01 for NAC and P < .05 for placebo; PaO2/FIO2 at day 3: P < .01 for NAC and P < .02 for placebo), but this improvement was similar for both groups and, moreover, the between-group comparison was never significantly different at the various collection days.</s><s>Oxidative stress has recently been implicated in the pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation (AF). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of antioxidant agent N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on postoperative AF. The population of this prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study consisted of 115 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass and/or valve surgery. All the patients were treated with standard medical therapy and were randomized to NAC group (n = 58) or placebo (saline, n = 57).</s><s>Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) has been implicated in causing poor pulmonary gas exchange postoperatively in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) procedures. Group I (ten patients) received a physiologic salt solution as a placebo in a continuous intravenous infusion for one hour before CPB and 24 hours after CPB; Group II (ten patients) received 100 mg/ kg NAC intravenously for one hour before CPB and 40 mg/kg/day at 24 hours after CPB. Postoperative tracheal extubation was accomplished at the earliest appropriate time. The malondialdehyde (MDA) increase in Group II following CPB was found to be significantly lower than in Group I (p = 0.043). There was no effect in other pulmonary parameters and in terms of intubation time.</s><s>Sepsis and respiratory dysfunction leading to multiple system organ failure remains the leading cause of postoperative morbidity and mortality following major surgical procedures. It has been suggested the oxygen free radicals might play a pivotal role in this process. The aim of this study was to investigate whether short-term infusion of N-acetylcysteine (N-acetylcysteine), a potent antioxidant, administered before and during extensive abdominal surgery, could ameliorate the progression of early postoperative organ dysfunction and improve oxygenation. The scores were obtained on admission, then daily during the first three postoperative days. There was no significant difference between the two groups in any of the six organ dysfunction parameters, length of intensive care stay, days of mechanical ventilation and mortality.</s><s>Pre-existing chronic renal failure is a significant risk factor for acute renal failure (ARF) after cardiac surgery. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been shown to prevent contrast media-induced ARF. NAC has renoprotective effects in patients with mild renal failure undergoing cardiac surgery. Levels of urinary NAG/creatinine ratio, plasma creatinine and serum cystatin C did not significantly differ between NAC and placebo groups during five postoperative days. Plasma creatinine increased by 25% from baseline or over 44 mumol litre(-1) in 42.1% in NAC group vs 48.7% in placebo group (P=0.560).</s><s>To determine the levels of glutathione and cysteine in patients with ARDS and examine the effect of treatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylate (Procysteine; Clintec Technologies Inc; Chicago [OTZ]) on these levels and on common physiologic abnormalities, and organ dysfunction associated with ARDS. Patients meeting a predetermined definition of ARDS and requiring mechanical ventilation. Both antioxidants effectively repleted RBC glutathione gradually over the 10-day treatment period (47% and 49% increases from baseline values for NAC and OTZ, respectively). Our findings suggest that repletion of glutathione may safely be accomplished with NAC or OTZ in patients with acute lung injury/ARDS.</s><s>N-acetylcysteine, a potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agent, is known to decrease the production of reactive oxygen species after cardiac surgery. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of intravenous N-acetylcysteine on clinical and biochemical outcomes after coronary artery bypass surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Postoperative clinical data (death, myocardial infarction, low-output syndromes, arrhythmias, bleeding, transfusion requirements, and intensive care unit and hospital lengths of stay) and biochemical markers (creatine kinase MB, troponin T, creatinine, hemoglobin, and platelet levels) were evaluated serially over 4 days. No differences were observed between the groups in interleukin-6 production (P = not significant).</s><s>To investigate the effects of adjunctive therapy with parenteral N-acetyl-L-cysteine in patients with newly diagnosed septic shock. Twenty patients (N-acetyl-L-cysteine group [n = 10], placebo group [n = 10]), 15 male and five female, of mean age 64 +/- 15 (SD) yrs and Acute Physiology and Chronic health Evaluation (APACHE) II score 33 +/- 6, with septic shock within 24 hrs of diagnosis. After a 2-hr stabilization period (time-zero minus 2 hrs to time-zero), patients received either N-acetyl-L-cysteine in 5% dextrose (150 mg/kg in 100 mL over 15 mins, followed by 50 mg/kg in 250 mL over 4 hrs, and then 100 mg/kg/24 hrs in 500 mL for 44 hrs; N-acetyl-L-cysteine group) or the equivalent volume of 5% dextrose (placebo group). Treatment group demographics and hemodynamic variables did not differ significantly between the two groups at time-zero. Over the next 48 hrs, in the N-acetyl-L-cysteine group, there was a progressive decrease, relative to both time-zero and the placebo group, in MAP, cardiac index, and left ventricular stroke work index (p < .01, repeated-measures analysis of variance).</s><s>It has been suggested that the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) may be beneficial in treatment. A provincial hospital in Western Thailand and a tertiary referral hospital in Chittagong, Bangladesh. Patients were randomized to receive NAC or placebo as an adjunctive treatment to intravenous artesunate. NAC had no significant effect on mortality, lactate clearance times (p = 0.74), or coma recovery times (p = 0.46). Admission red cell rigidity correlated with mortality, but did not improve with NAC.</s><s>N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an antioxidant drug largely tested in different clinical situations. Recently, NAC has been employed with variable success in the prevention of radiocontrast nephropathy. The groups were randomly matched for age, gender, presence of diabetes and pre-existent renal failure. Forty-two patients (n = 18 for NAC group and n = 24 for control) were studied. Need for suprarenal aortic cross-clamping and its duration, occurrence of major bleeding, intra-operative hypotension and the post-operative peak of CPK did not differ between NAC and control groups. The overall mortality was 23% (10/42) and was not different (P = 0.209) in NAC group (33.3%) when compared with control (16.7%), the same occurring with the length of ICU stay (2.93 +/- 1.53 vs 2.52 +/- 1.36 days, P = 0.40).</s><s>To examine whether the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine could ameliorate the course of the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in man. No improvement could be demonstrated in the PaO2/FiO2 ratio in the study group as compared with the control group on any day. We documented that N-acetylcysteine acts as an anticoagulant and perhaps decreases pulmonary fibrin uptake during ARDS.</s><s>Reactive oxygen species have been shown to contribute to myocardial stress in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, as demonstrated by myocardial 8-iso-prostaglandin-F(2)alpha and nitrotyrosine formation. We hypothesized that the reactive oxygen species scavenger N-acetylcysteine attenuates reactive oxygen species-mediated myocardial stress in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Forty patients undergoing coronary artery surgery (mean age +/- SD, 66 +/- 9 years; 9 women and 31 men) were randomized to receive either N-acetylcysteine (100 mg/kg into cardiopulmonary bypass prime followed by infusion at 20 mg.kg(-1).h(-1), n = 20) or placebo (n = 20). Cardiomyocyte staining was quantitatively determined by using densitometry (in gray units). Global left ventricular function was measured on the basis of fractional area of contraction by using transesophageal echocardiography.</s><s>Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury in patients undergoing coronary artery by-pass grafting (CABG) involves the reperfusion-induced conversion of reversible injured myocardial and endothelial cells. Demographic and procedural variables were similar in the both groups (All P>0.05). Creatine kinase MB isoform (CK-MB) mass levels did not significantly differ between the groups at both preoperative and postoperative periods. Eight patients in the NAC group and 7 in the placebo group had increased CK-MB >3 times normal value. However, only 3 patients in the NAC group experienced CK-MB>5 times normal value. Results of this study indicated that periprocedural use of NAC as intravenously did not attenuate myocardial damage after on-pump CABG surgery.</s><s>This study investigates the effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and rutin on the lung oxidative burden of patients with early adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The protection was evaluated by measuring expired ethane and malondialdehyde (MDA), and oxidized (GSSG) and reduced glutathione (GSH) in the epithelial lining fluid of 36 patients who developed ARDS less than 24 hours before enrollment in the study. Ethane and MDA concentrations were significantly reduced in the treatment groups after day 6.</s><s>Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury may complicate coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) operations. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) had antioxidant and microcirculatory effects, and inhibits neutrophil aggregation. Twenty patients undergoing elective coronary bypass operation with cardiopulmonary bypass were enrolled and randomly assigned to two groups: a control group operated with a routine CABG protocol, and one where NAC was administered intravenously during the operation (NAC group). Creatine kinase-MB levels at 6 and 12 hours were significantly lower in the NAC group (P = 0.02). We believe that its effects on clinical outcome may be more apparent in patients prone to ischemia-reperfusion injury.</s><s>Glutathione (GSH) acts as a free radical scavenger that may be helpful in preventing reperfusion injury. Our study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 100 patients; 50 received placebo and 50 received a loading dose of 140 mg/kg of intravenous (IV) NAC over 1 h followed by 70 mg/kg IV repeated every 4 h for a total of 12 doses. In addition to serum creatinine (SCr) levels, we analysed cystatin C and beta-trace as independent measures of glomerular filtration. IV NAC was not effective in reducing renal or hepatic injury in the setting of liver transplantation. The dose and duration of NAC used, though higher than most renal protection studies, may have been ineffective for raising GSH levels in some patients.</s><s>Renal dysfunction is a complication of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery performed with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) that is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. N-acetylcysteine, an antioxidant and vasodilator, counteracts renal ischemia and hypoxia. Randomized, quadruple blind, placebo-controlled trial (October 2003-September 2004) in operating rooms and general intensive care units (ICUs) of 2 Ontario tertiary care centers. The 295 patients required elective or urgent CABG and had at least 1 of the following: preexisting renal dysfunction, at least 70 years old, diabetes mellitus, impaired left ventricular function, or undergoing concomitant valve or redo surgery. A post hoc subgroup analysis of patients (baseline creatinine level >1.4 mg/dL [120 micromol/L]) showed a nonsignificant trend toward fewer patients experiencing postoperative renal dysfunction in the N-acetylcysteine group compared with the placebo group (25.0% vs 37.1%; P = .29). N-acetylcysteine did not prevent postoperative renal dysfunction, interventions, complications, or mortality in high-risk patients undergoing CABG surgery with CPB. Further research is required to identify CABG patients at risk for postoperative renal events, valid markers of renal dysfunction, and to establish renal thresholds associated with important clinical outcomes.</s><s>To assess the preventive effect of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine on postoperative acute renal failure in patients with renal insufficiency undergoing cardiac surgery. Two hundred fifty-four consecutive patients with chronic renal insufficiency (estimated creatinine clearance < or = 60 mL/min) undergoing elective cardiac surgery. Patients of the N-acetylcysteine group received four boluses of intravenous N-acetylcysteine (1200 mg every 12 hrs, starting immediately before cardiac surgery). It occurred in 52% of control patients and 40% of N-acetylcysteine-treated patients (p = .06). In-hospital mortality and need for renal replacement therapy were not affected by N-acetylcysteine, but a lower percentage of N-acetylcysteine-treated patients required mechanical ventilation prolonged for > 48 hrs (3% vs. 18%; p < .001) and had an intensive care unit stay > 4 days (13% vs. 33%; p < .001).</s><s>To determine if N-acetylcysteine warrants definitive evaluation in a large multicentre trial, we evaluated its effects on a surrogate outcome, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), in a randomized trial. bolus, 20 mgxkg(-1)xhr(-1) infusion until four hours after cardiopulmonary bypass), and 88 to placebo. Secondary outcomes included renal replacement therapy, mortality, atrial fibrillation, vasoactive medications, and adverse effects. A future multicentre trial was deemed to be warranted if N-acetylcysteine was associated with a percent change in eGFR that was 3.8 better (small benefit), and with an upper 95% confidence interval including 9.5 (moderate benefit). Given this finding, N-acetylcysteine should be definitively evaluated in a large randomized trial.</s><s>To see whether intravenous acetylcysteine would improve outcome in patients with fulminant hepatic failure after paracetamol overdose. 50 consecutive patients (21 male) aged 16-60 with fulminant hepatic failure after paracetamol overdose who had not previously received acetylcysteine. Acetylcysteine treated patients had a lower incidence of cerebral oedema (40% (10/25) v 68% (17/25); p = 0.047, 95% confidence interval for difference in incidence 2% to 54%), and fewer developed hypotension requiring inotropic support (48% (12/25) v 80% (20/25); p = 0.018, 95% confidence interval 7% to 57%). Rates of deterioration and recovery of liver function, however, were similar in the two groups.</s><s>Expression of inflammatory mediators is controlled in part at the transcriptional level via nuclear factor-kappa B. Inhibition of nuclear factor-kappa B activation may be beneficial in critically ill patients. N-acetylcysteine is an antioxidant that inhibits nuclear factor-kappa B activation in vitro. In this pilot study we investigated the effect of N-acetylcysteine on nuclear factor-kappa B activation and circulating cytokine and adhesion molecules in patients with sepsis. Twenty consecutive patients within 12 hrs of fulfilling the consensus criteria for sepsis. Interleukin-6 concentrations were high initially and then decreased in all patients, regardless of whether they received N-acetylcysteine or placebo. Soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 concentrations remained unchanged in all patients.</s><s>N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an antidote for acetaminophen poisoning, might benefit patients with non-acetaminophen-related acute liver failure. Secondary outcomes included transplant-free survival and rate of transplantation. The benefits of transplant-free survival were confined to the 114 patients with coma grades I-II who received NAC (52% compared with 30% for placebo; 1-sided P = .010); transplant-free survival for the 59 patients with coma grades III-IV was 9% in those given NAC and 22% in those given placebo (1-sided P = .912). Intravenous NAC generally was well tolerated; only nausea and vomiting occurred significantly more frequently in the NAC group (14% vs 4%; P = .031). Patients with advanced coma grades do not benefit from NAC and typically require emergency liver transplantation.</s>"

Two hundred forty-six children aged 6-35 mo with persistent diarrhea were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups to receive a daily supplement of 10 mg Zn alone (Zn; n = 81), zinc plus vitamins and other minerals at 1-2 times recommended daily intakes (Zn+VM; n = 82), or placebo (n = 83) for approximately 6 mo after the diarrhea episode ended. Supplement consumption was high ( approximately 90%) in all groups, although slightly more vomiting was reported in the Zn+VM group (P < 0.0001, analysis of variance). Morbidity was greater after supplementation with zinc plus multivitamins and minerals than it was after supplementation with zinc alone.</s><s>Undernourished children have poor levels of development that benefit from stimulation. Zinc deficiency is prevalent in undernourished children and may contribute to their poor development. We assessed the effects of zinc supplementation and psychosocial stimulation given together or separately on the psychomotor development of undernourished children. This was a randomized controlled trial with 4 groups: stimulation alone, zinc supplementation alone, both interventions, and control (routine care only). Significant interactions were found between zinc supplementation and stimulation. Zinc supplementation alone improved hand and eye coordination, and stimulation alone benefited the developmental quotient, hearing and speech, and performance.</s><s>Multiple studies have shown the benefits of zinc supplementation among young children in high-risk populations. The objectives of this study were to measure the effects of different doses of supplemental zinc on the plasma zinc concentration, morbidity, and growth of young children; to detect any adverse effects of 10 mg supplemental Zn on markers of copper or iron status; and to determine whether any adverse effects are alleviated by providing copper with zinc. Children received 1 of 5 daily supplements for 6 mo: 3, 7, or 10 mg Zn as zinc sulfate, 10 mg Zn + 0.5 mg Cu as copper sulfate, or placebo. Zinc supplementation, including doses as low as 3 mg/d, reduced the incidence of diarrhea by 21-42% (P < 0.01). Zinc supplementation with a dose as low as 3 mg/d increased plasma zinc concentrations and reduced diarrhea incidence in the study population. There were no observed adverse effects of 10 mg Zn/d on indicators of copper or iron status.</s><s>Zinc deficiency is a common nutritional problem in adult sickle-cell disease (SCD) patients. Zinc deficiency affects adversely T-helper1 (TH1) functions and cell mediated immunity and interleukin (IL)-2 production is decreased in zinc deficient subjects. We tested this hypothesis in 32 SCD subjects who were divided in three groups (Grs A, B, and C). Grs A (n = 11) and B (n = 10) were zinc deficient based on cellular zinc criteria and Gr C (n = 11) were zinc sufficient. Gr A subjects were observed for 1 year (baseline), following which they received zinc acetate (50 to 75 mg of elemental zinc orally daily) for 3 years. Further confirmation of our observations will require prospective studies of zinc supplementation in a larger number of SCD patients.</s><s>Zinc deficiency is associated with impaired immune function and an increased risk of infection. Supplementation can decrease the incidence of diarrhoea and pneumonia in children in resource-poor countries. However, in children with HIV-1 infection, the safety of zinc supplementation is uncertain. We aimed to assess the role of zinc in HIV-1 replication before mass zinc supplementation is recommended in regions of high HIV-1 prevalence. Baseline measurements of plasma HIV-1 viral load and the percentage of CD4+ T lymphocytes were established at two study visits before randomisation, and measurements were repeated 3, 6, and 9 months after the start of supplementation. 3 months after supplementation ended, the corresponding values were 5.5 (SD 0.77) and 5.4 (SD 0.61), a difference of 0.05 (-0.24 to 0.35). Two deaths occurred in the zinc supplementation group and seven in the placebo group (p=0.1). Children given zinc supplementation were less likely to get watery diarrhoea than those given placebo.</s><s>To study the effects of zinc supplementation on malaria and other causes of morbidity in young children living in an area holoendemic for malaria in west Africa. Secondary outcomes were the severity of malaria episodes, prevalence of malaria parasite, mean parasite densities, mean packed cell volume, prevalence of other morbidity, and all cause mortality. No difference was found between the zinc and placebo groups in the incidence of falciparum malaria (relative risk 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.86 to 1.11), mean temperature, and mean parasite densities during malaria episodes, nor in malaria parasite rates, mean parasite densities, and mean packed cell volume during cross sectional surveys. All cause mortality was non-significantly lower in children given zinc compared with those given placebo (5 v 12, P=0.1).</s><s>It has been documented that growth patterns differ between breastfed and formula-fed infants. Some investigators have suggested that these differences may be related to differences in zinc nutriture. Growth and indexes of body composition and gross motor development were measured monthly from 3 to 10 mo. Previously described differences in growth between breastfed and formula-fed infants in such populations do not appear to be due to differences in zinc nutriture.</s><s>This study attempted to define the possible contribution of zinc nutrition to immunocompetence and growth in severely malnourished infants. Although energy intake was similar in both groups, the zinc-supplemented infants had significantly higher linear growth gain, and their immune function improved as demonstrated by conversion of their delayed hypersensitivity skin reactions, enhanced lymphoproliferative response to PHA, and increased salivary IgA concentrations.</s><s>Pneumonia and diarrhoea cause much morbidity and mortality in children younger than 5 years. We aimed to examine whether giving zinc weekly could prevent clinical pneumonia and diarrhoea in children younger than 2 years. 1665 poor, urban children aged 60 days to 12 months were randomly assigned zinc (70 mg) or placebo orally once weekly for 12 months. After treatment assignment, 103 children in the treatment group and 44 in the control group withdrew. There were significantly fewer incidents of pneumonia in the zinc group than the control group (199 vs 286; relative risk 0.83, 95% CI 0.73-0.95), and a small but significant effect on incidence of diarrhoea (1881 cases vs 2407; 0.94, 0.88-0.99).

Anthropometric indexes, developmental indexes (Bayley Scales of Infant Development; BSID), and morbidity were recorded. At 12 mo, two-factor analysis of variance showed a significant interaction between iron and zinc for weight-for-age z score, knee-heel length, and BSID psychomotor development. Single supplementation with zinc significantly improved growth, and single supplementation with iron significantly improved growth and psychomotor development, but combined supplementation with iron and zinc had no significant effect on growth or development. Combined, simultaneous supplementation with iron and zinc to infants cannot be routinely recommended at the iron-to-zinc ratio used in this study.</s>"

The primary objective of stage 1 was to assess whether TLH results in equivalent or improved quality of life (QoL) up to 6 months after surgery compared with TAH. QoL was measured at baseline, 1 and 4 weeks (early), and 3 and 6 months (late) after surgery, using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) questionnaire. The primary endpoint was the difference between groups in QoL change from baseline at early and late timepoints (a 5% difference was considered clinically significant). Patients for both stages of the trial have now been recruited and are being followed up for disease-specific outcomes. Eight of 332 patients (2.4%) had treatment conversion-seven from TLH to TAH and one from TAH to TLH (patient preference). Improvements in QoL up to 6 months after surgery continued to favour TLH, except in the emotional and social wellbeing measures of FACT and the visual analogue scale of the EuroQoL five dimensions (EuroQoL-VAS).

Total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is less invasive and is assumed to be associated with lower morbidity, particularly in obese women. This randomised trial was done in 21 hospitals in The Netherlands, and 26 gynaecologists with proven sufficient skills in TLH participated. Randomisation by sequential number generation was done centrally in alternate blocks of six and three participants, with stratification by trial centre. After assignment, the study coordinators, patients, gynaecologists, and members of the panel were not masked to intervention. The primary outcome was major complication rate, assessed by an independent panel. The proportion of patients with a minor complication was 13.0% (24 of 185) in the TLH group and 11.7% (11 of 94) in the TAH group (p=0.76).

Randomized controlled trial with concealed allocation and blinded data analysis conducted between August 2000 and March 2006 in 30 intensive care units in Canada, Australia, and Saudi Arabia. The control strategy included target tidal volumes of 6 mL/kg of predicted body weight, plateau airway pressures not exceeding 30 cm H2O, and conventional levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (n = 508). Eighty-five percent of the 983 study patients met criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome at enrollment. All-cause hospital mortality rates were 36.4% and 40.4%, respectively (relative risk [RR], 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77-1.05; P = .19). Barotrauma rates were 11.2% and 9.1% (RR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.83-1.75; P = .33).</s><s>Recruitment maneuvers performed in early adult respiratory distress syndrome remain a matter of dispute in patients ventilated with low tidal volumes and high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Data were recorded at baseline, 3 min after the recruitment maneuver, and 30 min after baseline. No significant differences in Pao2/Fio2 and Qs/Qt were detected between the recruitment maneuver group and the control group at baseline and after 30 min (recruitment maneuver group [n = 15]: Pao2/Fio2, 139 +/- 46 mm Hg versus 138 +/- 39 mm Hg; Qs/Qt, 30.8 +/- 5.8% versus 29.2 +/- 7.4%; control group: [n = 15]: Pao2/Fio2, 145 +/- 33 mm Hg versus 155 +/- 52 mm Hg; Qs/Qt, 30.2 +/- 8.5% versus 28.1 +/- 5.4%).</s><s>Objective: Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and recruitment maneuvers (RMs) may partially reverse atelectasis and reduce ventilation-associated lung injury. The purposes of this study were to assess a) magnitude and duration of RM effects on arterial oxygenation and on requirements for oxygenation support (Fio2/PEEP) in patients with acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) receiving ventilation with low tidal volumes and high levels of PEEP; and b) frequency of adverse respiratory and circulatory events attributable to RMs. Baseline PEEP and Fio2 were 13.8 +/- 3.0 cm H2O and 0.39 +/- 0.10, respectively (mean +/- sd). Beneficial effects on gas exchange in responders appear to be of brief duration. More information is needed to determine the role of recruitment maneuvers in the management of ALI/ARDS.</s><s>In patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome, massive alveolar collapse and cyclic lung reopening and overdistention during mechanical ventilation may perpetuate alveolar injury. Conventional ventilation was based on the strategy of maintaining the lowest positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) for acceptable oxygenation, with a tidal volume of 12 ml per kilogram of body weight and normal arterial carbon dioxide levels (35 to 38 mm Hg). The difference in survival to hospital discharge was not significant; 13 of 29 patients (45 percent) in the protective-ventilation group died in the hospital, as compared with 17 of 24 in the conventional-ventilation group (71 percent, P=0.37). As compared with conventional ventilation, the protective strategy was associated with improved survival at 28 days, a higher rate of weaning from mechanical ventilation, and a lower rate of barotrauma in patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome. Protective ventilation was not associated with a higher rate of survival to hospital discharge.</s><s>Closed-circuit endotracheal suctioning (CES) is advocated for preventing hypoxemia caused by the loss of lung volume resulting from open endotracheal suctioning (OES). However, the efficiency of CES and OES on tracheal secretion removal has never been compared in patients with acute lung injury. Among 18 patients with acute lung injury, 9 underwent CES and OES at 3-h intervals in a random order using a negative pressure of -200 mmHg. After each CES, a recruitment maneuver was performed using 20 consecutive hyperinflations. Arterial blood gases were continuously recorded using an intravascular sensor. Increasing negative pressure to -400 cm H2O during CES did not change Pa(O2) but increased the tracheal aspirate mass (1.7 +/- 1.6 vs. 1.0 +/- 1.3 g; P = 0.02). Closed-circuit endotracheal suctioning followed by a recruitment maneuver prevents hypoxemia resulting from OES but decreases secretion removal.</s><s>We wished to investigate whether volume recruitment maneuvers (VRMs) could improve alveolar recruitment and oxygenation in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients, ventilated at relatively low positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). We identified a low (9.4 +/- 3 cmH2O) and a high (16.0 +/- 2 cmH2O) level of PEEP associated with target oxygenation values. VRMs were performed twice a minute by increasing PEEP to the high level for two breaths. During CPPV(HI), we observed significantly higher PaO2 (139.3 +/- 32.5 mmHg) and lower Q(VA)/Q(T) (0.37 +/- 0.08) compared to CPPV(LO) (P < 0.01) and to CPPV(VRM) (P < 0.05). VRMs can improve oxygenation and alveolar recruitment during CPPV at relatively low PEEP, but are relatively less effective than a continuous high PEEP level.</s>"

        "Abstracts": "<s>Tachycardia and hypertension may cause myocardial ischaemia in patients with coronary heart disease going through major surgery. Thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) has been reported to be beneficial in this situation. Haemodynamic parameters, the use of vasoactive and inotropic drugs and fluid balance were followed during the operation and for 20 h postoperatively. 89% of epidural group patients needed small doses of ephedrine whereas more HF group patients were given nitroglycerine. Lower MAP 0.5 h after bypass and higher filling pressures in the early post bypass period in the epidural groups, most pronounced in the HF+TEA group, were noted.</s><s>Microcirculation-dependent alteration of the gut mucosal barrier with subsequent translocation of endotoxins is a postulated mechanism for this inflammatory response. This study was designed to elucidate whether two different approaches to modulate splanchnic perfusion may influence systemic inflammation to CPB. Procalcitonin (PCT), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), soluble TNF receptor, human soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, C-reactive protein (CRP) and leukocyte count were measured as parameters of inflammation. However, neither splanchnic blood flow nor oxygen delivery and consumption were different when compared with the CON-group. These results do suggest that mechanisms other than an improved splanchnic blood flow by DPX and EPI treatment have to be considered for the anti-inflammatory effects.</s><s>A substantial reduction in lung volumes and pulmonary function follows cardiac surgery. Fifty-four male patients, under 65 years and with an ejection fraction of more than 0.5, were randomized into two groups: a control group receiving high-dose fentanyl anaesthesia and an epidural group receiving low-dose fentanyl anaesthesia + thoracic epidural analgesia. A 50-70% reduction in forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1.0) and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) was seen after surgery, but higher FEV1.0 and PEFR on days 2 and 3 were seen in the epidural group than in the control group. Epidural analgesia gave better control of the postoperative hyperdynamic circulation.</s><s>Epidural anesthesia has been suggested to exert a protective effect against the inflammatory and stress responses associated with surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of thoracic epidural anesthesia on myocardial cell damage, inflammatory, and stress responses in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass graft (OPCABG) surgery. Seventy-four patients (66 male [89%], mean age 65.2 years [SD 9.6]) undergoing OPCABG surgery were randomly assigned to receive either general anesthesia plus epidural (GAE [n = 36]) or general anesthesia only (GA [n = 38]). One patient died in the GAE group, but no other major postoperative complications were recorded in either group. The IL-6 and IL-8 levels were lower in the GAE group (ratio 0.83, 95% confidence interval: 0.68 to 1.02; p = 0.070) than in the GA group (ratio 0.90, 95% confidence interval: 0.78 to 1.02; p = 0.090).</s><s>To test the hypothesis that the choice of anesthesia technique for coronary artery surgery influences the degree and magnitude of the subsequent inflammatory response and its consequences. Tight control of perioperative hemodynamic parameters was maintained, and the postoperative management was strictly standardized. Bactericidal permeability-increasing protein as an indicator of the polymorphonuclear neutrophil response, interleukin-6 as an inducer of the acute-phase response, and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein and C-reactive protein as parameters of the acute phase response were determined at regular intervals. Ventilator dependency and analgesia were evaluated as clinical outcome measures.</s><s>Clinical observation and calculation of fluid balance have shown that patients undergoing aortocoronary bypass surgery with thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) in addition to general anesthesia retain less fluid than patients having general anesthesia only. Interstitial fluid colloid osmotic pressure (COPif) and interstitial fluid pressure (Pif) were measured subcutaneously at heart level by the blister suction technique and the wick-in-needle technique, respectively. Sixteen male patients were allocated to two groups, one having general anesthesia only (controls, n = 8). The other group (TEA, n = 8) received, at the induction of anesthesia, bupivacaine 50 mg via an epidural catheter as an adjunct to general anesthesia. Preoperatively no intergroup differences were observed in \"the Starling forces\" (COPpl, COPif, Pif). At the start of extracorporeal circulation COPpl was significantly lower in the TEA-group than in controls.</s><s>Postoperative pain relief and stress hormones were examined during the use of continuous epidural infusion of morphine at a rate of 0.1 mg/hr in 30 patients (Group B) after coronary artery bypass grafting. This was compared to our routine method of postoperative analgesia of intravenous morphine 2 mg/2 hr and as needed in another 30 patients (Group A). Continuous epidural morphine infusion required occasional supplementation with intravenous morphine and achieved effective analgesia in 80% of the patients. Serum morphine was undetectable (below 2.5 ng/ml) in Group B and was significantly lower than that in Group A (17 ng/ml).</s><s>To evaluate the effects of high thoracic epidural anesthesia (TEA) on global and regional myocardial function and on perioperative coronary risk in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. Of 73 randomized patients, 37 were control subjects (who received general anesthesia only) and 36 were in the group who received general anesthesia and high TEA. Secondary outcome measures were postoperative complications recorded to 14 days and mortality recorded to 720 days. Regional left ventricular function was significantly improved (mean [SD] global wall motion index, 0.74 [0.18] vs 0.38 [0.16]; P<.05), and cardiac troponin I concentrations were reduced by 72% (mean [SD], 5.7 [1.5] vs 1.6 [0.7] ng/mL, P<.05) in patients with high TEA. Natriuretic peptide concentrations peaked during reperfusion (atrial natriuretic peptide) and 24 hours after reperfusion (brain natriuretic peptide). Reversible cardiac sympathectomy by high TEA improves regional left ventricular function and reduces postoperative ischemia after coronary artery bypass grafting.</s><s>Cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) evokes a systemic inflammatory response involving the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-8 and anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10. The proinflammatory cytokines are potent inducers of the hepatic acute-phase protein synthesis. The aim of the present study was to investigate if choice of anaesthesia, based on high-dose opioids (fentanyl) versus low-dose opioids influenced the release of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10. Cytokine analyses were performed with ELISA, CRP and SAP mere measured with rocket immunoelectrophoresis (RIE). Surgery and CPB elicited a marked, transient and almost simultaneous proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine response with no differences between the groups. Anaesthesia and surgery did not affect SAP plasma levels while patients showed a major increase in CRP concentrations preceding the cytokine responses.</s><s>To evaluate the effect of perioperative thoracic epidural analgesia followed by postoperative epidural analgesia compared with conventional IV anesthesia on the occurrence of late postoperative hypoxemia in patients undergoing elective coronary bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either conventional IV anesthesia (CON) or general anesthesia combined with thoracic epidural anesthesia followed by postoperative epidural analgesia (TEA) with bupivacaine. The overall incidence of episodic hypoxemia was 56% (28 of 50 patients) on the second postoperative night and 89% (41 of 46 patients) on the third postoperative night. Despite oxygen therapy, 7% of patients (3 of 46 patients) experienced constant hypoxemia on the third night. Significantly more patients in the TEA group (25 of 25 patients) experienced episodic hypoxemia on the third postoperative night compared with the CON group (16 of 21 patients; p < 0.05).</s><s>The aim of the present investigation was to study the effects of intraoperative and postoperative epidural pain management during and after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) on the recovery time, postoperative pulmonary and cardiac parameters, visual analog scale (VAS) scores, and sedation scores (SS) compared with patients anesthetized with general anesthesia (GA) whose postoperative pain was relieved with intermittent intravenous (IV) administration of nicomorphine. In the GA group (n = 27), IV anesthesia with high-dose sufentanil and midazolam was used. Postoperative pain management in the GA group consisted of intermittent IV administration of nicomorphine, 0.1 mg/kg every 6 hours, whereas for the TEA group continuous high TEA with 0.125% bupivacaine plus sufentanil, 1:1,000,000 (0.05 mL/cm body length/hr) was used. Patients in the TEA group awakened earlier (148 [34] minutes vs 335 [51] minutes), resumed spontaneous respiration earlier (326 [79] minutes vs 982 [52] minutes), and were extubated earlier (463 [79] minutes vs 1140 [58] minutes).</s><s>Ischaemic damage to the myocardium inevitably occurs during coronary artery surgery. However, the extent of the damage may be influenced by the anaesthetic technique used. Patients undergoing emergency surgery and those with unstable angina were excluded. These data allows appropriate power calculations for further, large-scale studies to determine the anaesthetic technique that provides optimal myocardial protection.</s><s>To evaluate the effect of immediate postoperative extubation and postoperative ventilation after minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) surgery and to assess the role of epidural anesthesia. The epidural group and the extubated group had a transient respiratory acidosis postoperatively. Hospital stay was shorter in the epidural group than in the ventilated group (5.9 plus minus 2.4 days v 8.1 plus minus 5.3 days; p = 0.05)\n                Immediate postoperative extubation in patients with thoracic epidural anesthesia and supplemental general anesthesia provides the most favorable clinical circumstances after MIDCAB surgery.</s><s>High thoracic epidural techniques are increasingly being used in patients scheduled for cardiothoracic surgery, including coronary artery bypass grafting. Fifty adult patients were included in a prospective, randomized, double-blind study. Hemodynamic parameters and the intramyocardial oxygen partial pressure were recorded before and 20 min after the epidural injection. There were no demographic or hemodynamic differences between the groups before intervention. High thoracic epidural blockade with 5-10 ml of 0.3% ropivacaine increases myocardial oxygen availability in coronary diseased patients prior to surgical revascularization without deleterious hemodynamic disturbances.</s><s>In this prospective study, we evaluated whether high thoracic epidural anesthesia (TEA) or i.v. clonidine as a bolus of 4 microg/kg before the induction of general anesthesia. Clonidine was then infused at a rate of 1 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1) during surgery and at 0.2-0.5 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1) postoperatively. The remaining 21 patients underwent general anesthesia as performed routinely (control). During the preoperative night and a follow-up of 48 h after surgery, five-lead electrocardiogram monitoring was used for ischemia detection. Plasma epinephrine increased perioperatively in all groups but was significantly lower in the TEA group. This is associated with decreased myocardial ischemia as determined by less release of troponin T. These findings may have an impact on the anesthetic management for coronary artery bypass grafting.</s><s>The internal thoracic artery (ITA) is the preferred conduit for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. The authors investigated whether thoracic epidural anesthesia (TEA) as an adjunct to general anesthesia (GA) can increase the blood flow of the ITA. Thirty patients scheduled for elective CABG surgery were randomized to receive either GA (n = 15) or GA + TEA (n = 15) after receiving institutional review board approval. The epidural catheter was inserted in the thoracic region between T1 and T5 levels. In all patients, ITA free blood flow was measured before cardiopulmonary bypass and without the administration of any vasodilatory agent. The mean ITA free flow in the GA + TEA group was significantly higher than in the GA group (56.0 ± 9.0 mL/min v 39.6 ± 14 mL/min, p = 0.001).</s><s>The aim of the paper was to investigate whether thoracic epidural anesthesia (TEA) together with general anaesthesia (GA) play a role on apoptosis in humans before cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), before aortic cross clamp (ACC) and at 15 min after ACC release (after ischemia and reperfusion). Eighty patients scheduled for elective CABG were randomized to receive either GA group (n: 40) or TEA+GA group (n: 40). The right atrial biopsy samples were taken before CPB, before ACC and at 15 min after ACC release from all patients. Human heart tissues were obtained from patients of TEA+GA group and GA group. In addition, the intensity of the immunostaining was also increased in the TEA+GA compared with the GA group. Between groups, at 4 h and at 24 h after the end of CPB, in the TEA+GA group, the CI was significantly higher than GA group respectively; (3.4+/-0.8 L/min/m(2) vs 2.5+/-0.8 L/min/m(2); P<0.001), (3.8+/-1.1 L/min/m(2) vs 3.1+/-1.1 L/min/m(2); P<0.008). The number of patients showing VF after release of ACC was 9 out of 20 patients (22.5%) in the TEA+GA group which was significantly lower than in the GA group (21 of 40 patients 52.5%); (P<0.006).</s><s>Perioperative thoracic epidural analgesia reduces stress response and pain scores and may improve outcome after cardiac surgery. This prospective, randomized trial was designed to compare the effectiveness of patient-controlled thoracic epidural analgesia with patient-controlled analgesia with intravenous morphine on postoperative hospital length of stay and patients' perception of their quality of recovery after cardiac surgery. A validated quality of recovery score was used to measure postoperative health status. Length of stay and time to eligibility for hospital discharge were similar between the groups. Study groups differed neither in postoperative global quality of recovery score nor in five dimensions of quality of recovery score.</s><s>Atrial fibrillation is one of the most common complications in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. The incidence of perioperative dysarrhythmias was significantly lower (P < .01) in the GA+TEA group (3%) than in the GA group (23.7%). min(-1) in the GA+TEA group, whereas in the GA group no significant hemodynamic changes were observed (P < .001). Serum epinephrine levels were significantly lower in the GA+TEA group (69 +/- 11 to 35 +/- 7 ng/dL) than in the GA group (72 +/- 9 to 70 +/- 9 ng/dL). In our study cohort, high thoracic epidural anesthesia in combination with general anesthesia reduced significantly the incidence of perioperative arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation. Furthermore, we observed a significant reduction of epinephrine serum levels in this patient group.</s><s>Eighty patients were randomized to HTEA or intravenous morphine analgesia (control). Patients received coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) with cardiopulmonary bypass. Psychologic morbidity, intraoperative hemodynamics, ventricular function, lung function, and physiotherapy cooperation were also assessed. On the third postoperative day HTEA and morphine were ceased and only oral medications were used. The primary endpoint of pain scores was significantly less with HTEA on postoperative days 1 and 2 at rest, 0.02 +/- 0.2 versus 0.8 +/- 1.8 (p = 0.008) and 0.1 +/- 0.4 versus 1.2 +/- 2.7 (p = 0.022), respectively, and with coughing 1.2 +/- 1.7 versus 4.4 +/- 3.1 (p < 0.001) and 1.5 +/- 2.0 versus 3.6 +/- 3.1 (p = 0.001), respectively. The secondary endpoints of postoperative depression (p = 0.033) and posttraumatic stress subscales (p = 0.021) of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory were lower with HTEA.</s><s>The effects of high thoracic epidural anesthesia (TEA) on cardiac sympathetic nerve activity, myocardial blood flow and metabolism, and central hemodynamics were studied in 20 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Hemodynamic measurements and blood sampling were performed after induction of anesthesia but prior to skin incision and after sternotomy. Prior to surgery, mean arterial pressure (MAP), great cardiac vein flow (GCVF), and regional myocardial oxygen consumption (Reg-MVO2) were lower in the TEA group compared to the control group. None of the patients in the TEA group had metabolic (lactate) or electrocardiographic signs of myocardial ischemia. We conclude that TEA attenuates the surgically mediated sympathetic stress response to sternotomy, thereby preventing the increase in myocardial oxygen demand in the pre-bypass period without jeopardizing myocardial perfusion.</s><s>To measure predefined clinical effects resulting from the use of epidural anesthesia and analgesia during and after cardiac surgery. Sixty patients scheduled for elective cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. (2) A treatment group received thoracic epidural anesthesia combined with general anesthesia during surgery and epidural analgesia for the first 24 postoperative hours. No statistically significant differences between the 2 study groups were found in these main measurements.</s><s>The addition of thoracic epidural anesthesia (TEA) to general anesthesia (GA) during cardiac surgery may have a beneficial effect on clinical outcomes. TEA in cardiac surgery, however, is controversial because the insertion of an epidural catheter in patients requiring full heparinization for cardiopulmonary bypass may lead to an epidural hematoma. The clinical effects of fast-track GA plus TEA were compared with those of with fast-track GA alone. A randomized controlled trial was conducted in 654 elective cardiac surgical patients who were randomly assigned to combined GA and TEA versus GA alone. Thirty-day survival free from myocardial infarction, pulmonary complications, renal failure, and stroke was 85.2% in the TEA group and 89.7% in the GA group (P = 0.23).</s><s>High thoracic epidural anesthesia/analgesia (HTEA) for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery may have myocardial protective effects. In this prospective randomized controlled study, we investigated the effect of HTEA for elective CABG surgery on the release of troponin I, time to tracheal extubation, and analgesia. We conclude that HTEA for CABG surgery had no effect on troponin release but improved postoperative analgesia and was associated with a reduced time to extubation.</s><s>The aim of this two-center, open, randomized, controlled trial was to evaluate the impact of thoracic epidural anesthesia on early clinical outcomes in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery. Two hundred and twenty-six patients were randomized to either general anesthesia plus epidural (GAE) (n = 109) or general anesthesia only (GA) (n = 117). Secondary outcomes were: arrhythmia, inotropic support, intubation time, perioperative myocardial infarction, neurologic events, intensive care stay, pain scores, and analgesia requirement. Patients in the GAE group were more likely to need vasoconstrictors intraoperatively than in the GA group (odds ratio = 2.50, 95% CI [1.22-5.12]; P = 0.012).</s><s>We have investigated the hormonal and metabolic effects of thoracic extradural analgesia with bupivacaine in addition to sufentanil 20 micrograms kg-1 in nine patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery. Blood glucose values were unchanged until 24 h after surgery in the extradural group.</s><s>Improvements in analgesia after major surgery may allow a more rapid recovery and shorter hospital stay. We performed a prospective randomized trial to study the effects of epidural analgesia on the length of hospital stay after coronary artery surgery. The anesthetic technique and postoperative mobilization were altered to facilitate early intensive care discharge and hospital discharge. Fifty patients received high (T1 to T4) thoracic epidural anesthesia (TEA) with ropivacaine 1% (4-mL bolus, 3-5 mL/h infusion), with fentanyl (100-microg bolus, 15-25 microg/h infusion) and a propofol infusion (6 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1)). We found that epidural analgesia was more effective than IV morphine for cardiac surgery.</s><s>To determine the effects of thoracic epidural anesthesia (TEA) on ventilation-perfusion (VA/Q) relationships, atelectasis, and oxygenation before and after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). Perioperative and postoperative TEA was added to general anesthesia (GA) in 14 patients, and 14 patients receiving GA alone served as controls. Arterial and mixed venous blood gases and hemodynamic variables were measured by standard techniques. On the first postoperative day, a slight reduction in PaCO2 was seen in the TEA group, but no differences in shunt, VA/Q matching, or oxygenation compared with the GA group.</s><s>We performed an open, prospective, randomized, controlled study of the incidence of major organ complications in 420 patients undergoing routine coronary artery bypass graft surgery with or without thoracic epidural anesthesia and analgesia (TEA). Group TEA received TEA for 96 h. Group GA (general anesthesia) received narcotic analgesia for 72 h. Both groups received supplementary oral analgesia. Twelve patients were excluded-eight in Group TEA and four in Group GA-because of incomplete data collection. Extubation was achieved earlier (P < 0.0001) and with significantly fewer lower respiratory tract infections in Group TEA (TEA = 31 of 206, GA = 59 of 202; P = 0.0007).</s><s>Perioperative Thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) is an important part of a multimodal approach to improve analgesia and patient outcome after cardiac and thoracic surgery. This is particularly important for obese patients undergoing off pump coronary artery bypass surgery (OPCAB). We performed spirometry as preoperative assessment and at six hours, 24 hours, second, third, fourth and fifth day after extubation, along with arterial blood gases analysis. Visual analogue scale at rest and on coughing was recorded to assess the degree of analgesia. ABG values and PaO2/FiO2 ratio were statistically higher in the study group up to five days. Visual analogue scale at rest and on coughing was significantly lower till fourth and third postoperative day respectively. Tracheal extubation time, oxygen withdrawal time and ICU stay were significantly less in group 1.</s><s>This study was designed to assess the effects of a perioperative dosing regimen of amiodarone administration, high thoracic epidural anesthesia (TEA), or a combination of the 2 regimens on atrial fibrillation (AF) after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The study was prospective, controlled, and randomized and was performed in a tertiary health care center associated with a university. One hundred sixty-three patients scheduled for coronary artery bypass graft surgery. In this 2 x 2 factorial-designed study the patients were randomized to 1 of 4 regimens in which group E had perioperative TEA, group E+A had TEA and amiodarone, group A had amiodarone, and group C served as control.

A total of 183 children 8 to 14 years old and their primary caregivers were assessed 6 and 12 months after their posttreatment evaluations. Mixed-model repeated analyses of covariance found that children treated with TF-CBT had significantly fewer symptoms of PTSD and described less shame than the children who had been treated with CCT at both 6 and 12 months. The caregivers who had been treated with TF-CBT also continued to report less severe abuse-specific distress during the follow-up period than those who had been treated with CCT.</s><s>Effective psychological intervention is needed to help children recover from disaster-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). At one-year follow-up of a prior intervention for disaster-related symptoms, some previously treated children were still suffering significant trauma symptoms. The Children's Reaction Inventory (CRI) was the primary measure of the treatment's effect on PTSD symptoms. Treatment resulted in substantial reductions in both groups' CRI scores and in significant, though more modest, reductions in RCMAS and CDI scores. Health visits to the school nurse were significantly reduced following treatment.</s><s>To evaluate community-provided trauma-focused cognitive behavior therapy (TF-CBT) compared with usual community treatment for children with intimate partner violence (IPV)-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Recruitment, screening, and treatment were conducted at a community IPV center between September 1, 2004, and June 30, 2009. Total child PTSD symptoms assessed using child and parent structured interview (Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia, Present and Lifetime Version [K-SADS-PL]) and self-report (University of California at Los Angeles PTSD Reaction Index [RI]). The TF-CBT completers experienced significantly greater PTSD diagnostic remission (χ(2) = 4.67, P = .03) and had significantly fewer serious adverse events. Community TF-CBT effectively improves children's IPV-related PTSD and anxiety.</s><s>To determine whether participation in a mind-body skills group program based on psychological self-care, mind-body techniques, and self-expression decreases symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Eighty-two adolescents meeting criteria for PTSD according to the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (which corresponds with 16 of the 17 diagnostic criteria for PTSD in DSM-IV) were randomly assigned to a 12-session mind-body group program or a wait-list control group. The program was conducted by high school teachers in consultation with psychiatrists and psychologists and included meditation, guided imagery, and breathing techniques; self-expression through words, drawings, and movement; autogenic training and biofeedback; and genograms. The study was conducted from September 2004 to May 2005 by The Center for Mind-Body Medicine at a high school in the Suhareka region of Kosovo. Students in the immediate intervention group had significantly lower PTSD symptom scores following the intervention than those in the wait-list control group (F = 29.8, df = 1,76; p < .001). Mind-body skills groups can reduce PTSD symptoms in war-traumatized high school students and can be effectively led by trained and supervised schoolteachers.</s><s>To examine the efficacy and maintenance of developmentally adapted prolonged exposure therapy for adolescents (PE-A) compared with active control time-limited dynamic therapy (TLDP-A) for decreasing posttraumatic and depressive symptoms in adolescent victims of single-event traumas. PE-A exhibited a greater decrease of posttraumatic stress disorder and depression symptom severity and a greater increase in global functioning than did TDLP-A. After treatment, 68.4% of adolescents beginning treatment with PE-A and 36.8% of those beginning treatment with TLDP-A no longer met diagnostic criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder.

Despite high rates of impairment, there have been no randomized controlled trials examining the feasibility and efficacy of mental health interventions for former child soldiers. To assess the efficacy of a community-based intervention targeting symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in formerly abducted individuals. Symptoms of PTSD, depression, and related impairment were assessed before treatment and at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months postintervention. Treatments were carried out in 8 sessions by trained local lay therapists, directly in the communities. Secondary outcome measures were depression symptoms, severity of suicidal ideation, feelings of guilt, and perceived stigmatization. Contrast analyses of the time × treatment interaction of the mixed-effects model on PTSD symptom change over time revealed a superiority of narrative exposure therapy compared with academic catch-up (F(1,234.1) = 5.21, P = .02) and wait-listing (F(1,228.3) = 5.28, P = .02).</s><s>The North-Eastern part of Sri Lanka had already been affected by civil war when the 2004 Tsunami wave hit the region, leading to high rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in children. A randomized treatment comparison was implemented in a refugee camp in a severely affected community. Outcome measures included severity of PTSD symptoms, level of functioning and physical health. There was no significant difference between the two therapy groups in any outcome measure. As recovery rates in the treatment groups exceeded the expected rates of natural recovery, the study provides preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of NET as well as meditation-relaxation techniques when carried out by trained local counselors for the treatment of PTSD in children in the direct aftermath of mass disasters.</s><s>To evaluate the efficacy of individual trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for treating posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in children and young people. Compared to the WL group, participants who received CBT showed significantly greater improvement in symptoms of PTSD, depression, and anxiety, with significantly better functioning. After CBT, 92% of participants no longer met criteria for PTSD; after WL, 42% of participants no longer met criteria. Individual trauma-focused CBT is an effective treatment for PTSD in children and young people.</s>"

We recorded the incidence of major bleeding during the initial heparin treatment and that of recurrent VTE and death during 3 months of follow-up. Fifteen (4.2%) of the 360 patients assigned to UFH had recurrent thromboembolic events, as compared with 14 (3.9%) of the 360 patients assigned to nadroparin (absolute difference between rates, 0.3%; 95% confidence interval, -2.5% to 3.1%).</s><s>In a prospective multicenter trial, 149 consecutive patients with phlebographically proven proximal and/or distal deep vein thrombosis of the leg were randomly allocated to receive subcutaneously for 10 days either low molecular weight heparin CY 216 (Fraxiparine) in a fixed dose or unfractionated heparin (UFH) in doses adjusted according to the activated partial thromboplastin time. Pre- and post-treatment phlebograms were assessed blindly using the Arnesen's score system in 134 patients available for analysis of the treatment efficacy.

Sixteen ulcerative colitis patients received IFN-alpha-2A subcutaneously (dosage: first wk, 9 MIU three times weekly [t.i.w. ), and 16 received prednisolone enemas for 30 days (100 ml once daily, 0.25 mg of prednisolone/ml). There were no differences between scores of the two groups either before or after treatment. Only moderate side effects from the IFN-alpha-2A treatment were seen during the first 2-4 wk of treatment. Larger, randomized trials are, however, warranted to confirm this finding, owing to possible type II errors in group comparisons.</s><s>We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of recombinant interferon-beta-1a (rIFN-beta-1a) in outpatients with active steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment. In 18 of 32 patients (56%) in group A, in 11 of 30 patients (36%) in group B, and in 10 of 29 patients (34%) in group C, a reduction of the CAI of 6 points or greater (response) was achieved (differences were not statistically significant). Complete response (reduction of CAI to < or =4) was achieved in 56%, 30%, and 38% of patients in groups A, B, and C, respectively.</s><s>The present study was performed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of IFN-beta-1a. Patients (n=18) with moderately active ulcerative colitis were randomised to receive IFN-beta-1a or placebo. Clinical response was achieved in five patients (50%) in the IFN-beta-1a group and in one (14%) in the placebo group (P=0.14). IFN-beta-1a may represent a promising novel treatment approach in ulcerative colitis.</s><s>Pilot studies of interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) suggest a high remission rate in the treatment of active ulcerative colitis. We evaluated the safety of pegylated interferon alpha (PegIFN) and its role in induction of remission in patients with active ulcerative colitis, in a multicentre placebo controlled trial. Early withdrawal from the study was observed in 11/20 placebo patients, in 6/19 in the PegIFN 0.5 microg/kg group, and in 10/21 in the PegIFN 1.0 microg/kg group, mainly due to lack of efficacy. The higher PegIFN dose was associated with a significant decrease in levels of C reactive protein (p=0.003, day 0 v 85). PegIFN is safe but not effective, at the dosages used, in patients with ulcerative colitis.</s>"

Moderate to severe exacerbations were defined as worsening symptoms of COPD requiring treatment with oral corticosteroids, antibiotics, or hospitalization. Adverse events were reported for a similar percentage of subjects across groups. A higher reporting of pneumonia was observed with fluticasone propionate/salmeterol 250/50 than salmeterol (7% vs. 4%). The benefits of this reduction relative to the risk of a higher incidence of reported pneumonia should be considered.</s><s>Lung function in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can be improved acutely by oral corticosteroids and bronchodilators. Whether clinical improvement can be maintained by subsequent inhaled therapy is unknown. inhaled budesonide/formoterol 320/9 microg, budesonide 400 microg, formoterol 9 microg or placebo for 12 months. Fewer patients receiving budesonide/formoterol withdrew from the study than those receiving budesonide, formoterol or placebo. Budesonide/formoterol patients had a prolonged time to first exacerbation (254 versus 96 days) and maintained higher FEV1 (99% versus 87% of baseline), both primary variables versus placebo. Budesonide/formoterol in a single inhaler (Symbicort) maintains the benefit of treatment optimisation, stabilising lung function and delaying exacerbations more effectively than either component drug alone or placebo.</s><s>Combination therapy with a long-acting bronchodilator and an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) is recommended in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who have frequent exacerbations. The efficacy and tolerability of the combination of budesonide/formoterol have been demonstrated in patients with COPD when administered via the dry powder inhaler (DPI) in a 1-year study and when administered via the hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) in a 6-month study. This was a 12-month, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, active- and placebo-controlled, multicentre study (NCT00206167) of 1, 964 patients aged >or =40 years with moderate to very severe COPD conducted from 2005 to 2007 at 237 sites in the US, Europe and Mexico. The co-primary efficacy variables were pre-dose forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and 1-hour post-dose FEV1. Budesonide/formoterol 320/9 microg demonstrated greater improvements in pre-dose FEV1 versus formoterol (p = 0.008), and both budesonide/formoterol doses demonstrated greater improvements in 1-hour post-dose FEV1 versus placebo (p < 0.001). The rate of COPD exacerbations was lower in both budesonide/formoterol groups compared with formoterol and placebo (p <or= 0.004).

Predose and postdose spirometry, plethysmography, and constant-load cycle cardiopulmonary exercise test evaluations were compared. A total of 185 patients (mean baseline FEV1 of 41% predicted) were enrolled. At a standardized time during exercise (isotime), FSC 250/50 increased postdose IC by 0.20 +/- 0.05 L over placebo with associated improvements in tidal volume and minute ventilation (p < 0.05 vs placebo at week 8). Improvement in exercise time was significantly correlated with the increase in IC (r = 0.45, p < 0.001) but not FEV1 (r = 0.23, p = 0.08). We conclude that FSC 250/50 decreases lung hyperinflation at rest and during exercise with an associated increase in exercise endurance time when compared with placebo.</s><s>Inhaled long-acting beta2 agonists improve lung function and health status in symptomatic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), whereas inhaled corticosteroids reduce the frequency of acute episodes of symptom exacerbation and delay deterioration in health status. We postulated that a combination of these treatments would be better than each component used alone. 1465 patients with COPD were recruited from outpatient departments in 25 countries. We assessed adverse events, serum cortisol concentrations, skin bruising, and electrocardiograms. Combination treatment produced a clinically significant improvement in health status and the greatest reduction in daily symptoms. Because inhaled long-acting beta2 agonists and corticosteroid combination treatment produces better control of symptoms and lung function, with no greater risk of side-effects than that with use of either component alone, this combination treatment should be considered for patients with COPD.</s><s>The combination of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and a long-acting bronchodilator is recommended in the treatment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who have frequent exacerbations. To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of budesonide/formoterol administered via one hydrofluoroalkane pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) in patients with COPD. This was a 6-month, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre study (NCT00206154) of 1704 patients aged > or =40 years with moderate to very severe COPD conducted in 194 centres in the US, Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Poland and South Africa. After 2 weeks of treatment based on previous therapy (ICSs and short-acting bronchodilators allowed during the run-in period), patients received one of the following treatments administered twice daily: budesonide/formoterol pMDI 160/4.5 microg x two inhalations (320/9 microg); budesonide/formoterol pMDI 80/4.5 microg x two inhalations (160/9 microg); budesonide pMDI 160 microg x two inhalations (320 microg) plus formoterol DPI 4.5 microg x two inhalations (9 microg); budesonide pMDI 160 microg x two inhalations (320 microg); formoterol DPI 4.5 microg x two inhalations (9 microg); or placebo. The co-primary efficacy variables were pre-dose forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) and 1-hour post-dose FEV(1). Budesonide/formoterol 320/9 microg demonstrated significantly greater improvements in pre-dose FEV(1) versus formoterol (p = 0.026; pre-specified primary comparator) and 1-hour post-dose FEV(1) versus budesonide (p < 0.001; pre-specified primary comparator); budesonide/formoterol 160/9 microg demonstrated significantly greater improvements versus budesonide (p < 0.001) for 1-hour post-dose FEV(1) but not versus formoterol for pre-dose FEV(1). Although not powered a priori for comparisons, the number of exacerbations per patient-treatment year requiring treatment with oral corticosteroids and/or hospitalization was numerically (20-25%) lower with the budesonide-containing treatments (0.710-0.884) versus formoterol (1.098) and placebo (1.110). This result was driven by the exacerbations requiring treatment with oral corticosteroids (79-120 events). There was no increase in the incidence of pneumonia in the active treatment groups relative to placebo.

A significantly greater increase in predose FEV(1) at the endpoint was observed after FSC (156 ml) compared with S (107 ml, p = 0.012) and placebo (-4 ml, p < 0.0001). We conclude that FSC improved lung function and reduced the severity of dyspnea compared with individual components and placebo.</s><s>To compare the efficacy and safety of the inhaled corticosteroid fluticasone propionate (FP) and the inhaled long-acting beta(2)-agonist salmeterol (SM), when administered together in a single device (Diskus; GlaxoSmithKline, Inc; Research Triangle Park, NC), with that of placebo and the individual agents alone in patients with COPD. Seven hundred twenty-three patients > or =40 years of age with COPD and a mean baseline FEV(1) of 42% predicted. Other efficacy measures were as follows: morning peak expiratory flow rate (PEF); transition dyspnea index; chronic respiratory disease questionnaire; chronic bronchitis symptom questionnaire; exacerbations; and other symptomatic measures. At Endpoint (ie, the last on-treatment, post-baseline assessment), treatment with FSC significantly (p < or = 0.012) increased the morning predose FEV(1) (165 mL) compared with SM (91 mL) and placebo (1 mL), and significantly (p < or = 0.001) increased the 2-h postdose FEV(1) (281 mL) compared with FP (147 mL) and placebo (58 mL). Compared with placebo, FSC significantly improved dyspnea, quality of life, and symptoms of chronic bronchitis. The incidence of adverse effects (except for an increase in oral candidiasis with FSC and FP) were similar among the treatment groups.</s><s>Bronchodilator agents are central to the symptomatic management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), and long-acting inhaled bronchodilators are regarded as more convenient. The role of inhaled corticosteroids still remains controversial, but there is increasing evidence that they may improve FEV(1) and symptoms in the long-term. t-test, anova in each treatment group, and anova among basal values and among the 52 week values were used, being p<0.05 accepted. Also changes (DeltaFEV(1)) from baseline were compared at different control times. The mean number of exacerbations/yr decreased from 3.5+/-0.8 to 1.16+/-0.75 s.d. over the baseline pre-treatment value after 36 weeks of treatment (anova p<0.001), being FEV(1) unchanged after 52 weeks of treatment in SM group (+0.33%+/-2.4 s.d.) After 52 weeks of treatment, only subjects treated with SM&FP showed a reduction of the daily symptoms score from 3.6+/-0.7 to 2.0+/-0.2 s.d. SM&FP 50/250 microcg regularly assumed in combination via a single Diskus inhaler for a 52 week period improves respiratory function (such as FEV(1), morning PEF), and and symptom score significantly in moderate COPD previously treated with theophylline, and at an higher extent than SM alone or P. The use of beta(2) short acting prn is also reduced, together with the number of exacerbations.</s><s>Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) greatly contribute to declining health status and the progression of the disease, thereby incurring significant direct and indirect health care costs. To assess the impact of combination therapy with salmeterol/fluticasone propionate compared with salmeterol alone on moderate and severe exacerbations in patients with severe COPD and a history of repeated exacerbations. In addition, the mean time to first exacerbation in the combination therapy group was significantly longer compared with that of the salmeterol group (128 vs. 93 d, p < 0.0001). Other endpoints, including health-related quality of life, peak expiratory flow, and use of rescue medication, were significantly improved in the combination therapy group.</s><s>Prevention and treatment of COPD exacerbations are recognized as key goals in disease management. Subjects received treatment with FSC 250/50 during a one month run-in, followed by randomization to FSC 250/50 or SAL for 52 weeks. In 797 subjects with COPD (mean FEV(1) = 0.98L, 34% predicted normal), treatment with FSC 250/50 significantly reduced the annual rate of moderate/severe exacerbations by 30.4% compared with SAL (1.10 and 1.59 per subject per year, respectively, p < 0.001), the annual rate of exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids by 34% (p < 0.001) and the annual rate of moderate/severe exacerbations requiring hospitalization by 36% (p = 0.043). Pneumonia was reported more frequently with FSC 250/50 compared with SAL (7% vs. 2%). FSC 250/50 is more effective than SAL at reducing the rate of moderate/severe exacerbations.</s><s>The efficacy and safety of budesonide/formoterol in a single inhaler compared with placebo, budesonide and formoterol were evaluated in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In a 12-month, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in 812 adults (mean age 64 yrs, mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 36% predicted normal), patients received two inhalations twice daily of either budesonide/formoterol (Symbicort) 160/4.5 microg (delivered dose), budesonide 200 microg (metered dose), formoterol 4.5 microg or placebo. Improvements in morning and evening PEF versus comparators were maintained over 12 months.

The administration of prophylactic tranexamic acid in patients with scoliosis undergoing posterior spinal fusion surgery has the potential to reduce perioperative blood transfusion requirements. Implications: The administration of prophylactic tranexamic acid in patients with scoliosis who are undergoing posterior spinal fusion surgery has the potential to reduce perioperative blood transfusion requirements.</s><s>Excessive bleeding often occurs during pediatric scoliosis surgery and is attributed to numerous factors, including accelerated fibrinolysis.

Recently, there has been interest in pharmacologic agents, particularly Amicar and Aprotinin, to assist in decreasing perioperative blood loss. In 2001, in a preliminary study, we demonstrated that Amicar appeared to be effective in reducing perioperative blood loss in patients with idiopathic scoliosis undergoing a posterior spinal fusion and segmental spinal instrumentation. The criteria to be included in the study was the same as the preliminary study: diagnosis of idiopathic scoliosis, age at surgery 11 to 18 years, posterior spinal fusion and segmental spinal instrumentation only, autogenous iliac crest bone graft or homologous cancellous bone graft, and a signed agreement to participate in the study. Interestingly, this decrease was predominantly in the postoperative suction drainage. The patients taking Amicar had no intraoperative or postoperative thromboembolic complications. The results of this study confirmed that the use of intraoperative Amicar is a safe, effective, and inexpensive method to significantly reduce perioperative blood loss in patients with idiopathic scoliosis undergoing posterior spinal fusion and segmental spinal instrumentation.

In patients with neurologic diseases, a systematic approach to weaning and extubation reduces the rate of reintubation secondary to extubation failure without affecting the duration of mechanical ventilation, and is overall positively perceived by intensive care unit professionals.</s><s>Weaning protocols can improve outcomes, but their efficacy may vary with patient and staff characteristics. In this prospective, controlled trial, we compared protocol-based weaning to usual, physician-directed weaning in a closed medical intensive care unit (ICU) with high physician staffing levels and structured, system-based rounds. Patients assigned to UC (n=145) were managed at their physicians' discretion.

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either protocol-directed (n = 179) or physician-directed (n = 178) weaning from mechanical ventilation. Other outcome measures included need for reintubation, length of hospital stay, hospital mortality rate, and hospital costs. Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis, adjusting for other covariates, showed that the rate of successful weaning was significantly greater for patients receiving protocol-directed weaning compared with patients receiving physician-directed weaning (risk ratio 1.31; 95% confidence interval 1.15 to 1.50; p = .039).</s><s>The purpose of this study was to determine if a computer-directed weaning system could wean patients with complex medical problems from mechanical ventilation and appropriately respond to signs of respiratory failure more effectively than traditional physician-directed weaning methods. In a prospective, randomized, controlled study, we tested the system in 15 patients who had required prolonged mechanical ventilation and met predetermined weaning tests. Pulse oximeter oxygen saturation was monitored, and alarms were triggered by an oxygen saturation of < 90 percent. In the physician control group, weaning progressed with SIMV rate and PS reduction, as judged appropriate by the physician. Nine patients were assigned to the computer group; six patients were assigned to the control group. The average time on mechanical ventilation prior to weaning was 13.4 +/- 7.8 days for the computer group and 14.5 +/- 11.1 days for the control group.</s><s>Prompt recognition of the reversal of respiratory failure may permit earlier discontinuation of mechanical ventilation, without harm to the patient. In the intervention group, patients underwent daily screening of respiratory function by physicians, respiratory therapists, and nurses to identify those possibly capable of breathing spontaneously; successful tests were followed by two-hour trials of spontaneous breathing in those who met the criteria. Physicians were notified when their patients successfully completed the trials of spontaneous breathing. Although the 149 patients randomly assigned to the intervention group had more severe disease, they received mechanical ventilation for a median of 4.5 days, as compared with 6 days in the 151 patients in the control group (P=0.003). Complications -- removal of the breathing tube by the patient, reintubation, tracheostomy, and mechanical ventilation for more than 21 days -- occurred in 20 percent of the intervention group and 41 percent of the control group (P=0.001).</s><s>A respiratory therapist-driven weaning protocol incorporating daily screens, spontaneous breathing trials (SBT), and prompts to caregivers has been associated with superior outcomes in mechanically ventilated medical patients. To determine the effectiveness of this approach in neurosurgical (NSY) patients, we conducted a randomized controlled trial involving 100 patients over a 14-mo period. Patients in the Intervention (n = 49) and Control (n = 51) groups had similar demographic characteristics, illness severity, and neurologic injuries. Forty (82%) patients in the Intervention group passed SBT, but a median of 2 d passed before attempted extubation, primarily because of concerns about the patient's sensorium (84%). Overall complications included death (36%), reintubation (16%), and pneumonia (9%). The odds of successful extubation increased by 39% with each GCS score increment.

In conclusion, controlled release formulations provide more steady serum concentrations of carbamazepine along with better tolerability.</s><s>The pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy and side effects of carbamazepine (CBZ) in the steady-state condition were studied using a slow-release preparation (SR), Neurotol Slow, and a conventional preparation (C), Tegretol. Eighteen adult epileptic patients under CBZ therapy were evaluated in this single-blind, randomized cross-over study. The previous daily CBZ dose was kept unchanged and divided into 2 daily doses during two 2 week study periods. The fluctuations in serum CBZ and CBZE were significantly lower during SR treatment. The occurrence of dizziness was significantly lower with SR treatment than with C treatment.</s><s>A new capsule dosage form of carbamazepine (CBZ) has been developed, consisting of three different types of beads (immediate-release, extended-release, and enteric-release) that may be taken sprinkled on food or swallowed for easy administration. The randomized, double-blind, two-way, cross-over study was conducted at two sites, with a planned sample size of 24 adult patients with epilepsy. At the end of the 2-week period, blood samples were obtained hourly for a 24-h period. The 90% confidence intervals (CI) of the ratio of the means of the extended-release formulation twice daily to the immediate-release formulation four times daily were within the range of 0.80-1.25 for each of the pharmacokinetic parameters for CBZ and for the summation of CBZ and CBZ-epoxide (CBZ-E). There was no difference in the frequency of seizures between treatment (p = 0.103).</s><s>The occurrence of side effects and epileptic seizures and the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine (CBZ) and carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide were studied using a slow-release CBZ preparation, Neurotol slow, and a conventional CBZ preparation, Tegretol. The initial sample consisted of 24 adult epileptic patients receiving CBZ treatment of whom 20 patients were evaluable. The fluctuation in serum CBZ concentrations did not differ significantly between the 2 treatment periods, even though the interdose interval of Neurotol slow was 4 h longer than that of Tegretol. By using Neurotol slow instead of a conventional CBZ preparation, Tegretol, it is evidently possible to reduce the dosing frequency from 3 times a day to twice daily administrations.</s><s>Pharmacokinetic properties and efficacy of a conventional (C) carbamazepine (CBZ) preparation divided into three daily doses and a slow-release CBZ preparation (SR) divided into two daily doses were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. The trial started with a 8-week baseline period followed by the two treatment periods each 10 weeks long. At the end of each period, a 24-h blood sample series for determination of serum CBZ and carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (CBZE) was collected. The mean serum CBZ concentration in the morning samples was significantly (P less than 0.001) higher during SR treatment.</s><s>The tolerability and pharmacokinetics of a new controlled-release (CR) formulation of carbamazepine (CBZ), were assessed in a multicentre, double-blind, cross-over trial, carried out in 48 epileptic patients (21 men, 27 women; mean age 34.2 years) on conventional CBZ monotherapy, but without complete seizure control (n = 22) or with intermittent side effects (n = 4), or with both (n = 22). Eligible patients were randomized to conventional CBZ or CR CBZ, each given in sequence at individualized daily doses, subdivided into the lowest number of administrations. At the end of each period, a 10-h plasma CBZ and CBZ-epoxide concentration profile, as well as the tolerability and the efficacy of the drugs, were evaluated. Finally, 38 patients on CR CBZ (vs 15 patients on conventional CBZ) were treated with a b.i.d.</s><s>Twenty-one epileptic patients completed a double-blind, double-dummy, random order, crossover comparison of conventional carbamazepine (CBZ, Tegretol, Ciba-Geigy) with a new controlled-release formulation (CBZ-CR, Tegretol Retard). mean) were lower (CBZ 11.4 +/- 0.4 mg l-1; CBZ-CR 10.4 +/- 0.5 mg l-1; P less than 0.01) and times to peak longer (CBZ 3.6 +/- 0.5 h, CBZ-CR 5.2 +/- 0.7 h, P less than 0.01) during CBZ-CR treatment.</s><s>The aim of this double-blind cross-over study was to investigate whether side effects of carbamazepine (CBZ) could be reduced by using a slow-release CBZ preparation. Twenty-one adult patients with epilepsy who had side effects related to the use of CBZ took part in the trial. The daily dose and dosing frequency of CBZ were kept the same as before the study. The mean total values of NTRS of 3 monthly visits on each drug were significantly less during SR than during C treatment (P less than 0.05). All the items of NTRS scored lower during SR therapy, and the difference was significant for the occurrence of headache, dizziness and disturbances of vision, speech and coordination.</s><s>The treatment of epilepsy with carbamazepine (CBZ) may be hampered by cognitive side effects. These side effects are thought to be related to pharmacokinetic properties of the drug. Cognitive defects may result from peak levels: short periods with high serum concentration. The patients were then assigned randomly to either CBZ-controlled release (CR) or a condition in which conventional CBZ was administered in the same tablet form and dose frequency as CR. A systematic tendency was found toward higher test performance in the CR condition. This is especially evident for tests of memory and accuracy of visual information processing.</s>"

        "Abstracts": "<s>We compared the efficacy, safety, an tolerability of pramipexole, an aminobenzathiazol-derived dopamine agonist with novel properties, with those of placebo in advanced PD patients with motor fluctuations under levodopa treatment. Adverse effects related to the central nervous system were similar to those reported with other dopamine agonists, and the gastrointestinal and cardiovascular tolerability of the compound was satisfactory.</s><s>The purpose of this double-blind placebo controlled study was to estimate how much the levodopa dosage can be reduced, when deprenyl is used, without worsening the disease and to see whether deprenyl can reduce the \"off-periods\". The trial demonstrates that with deprenyl the levodopa dosage can be reduced considerably without prejudicing the therapeutic outcome.</s><s>To evaluate the efficacy of ropinirole 24-hour prolonged release (ropinirole 24-hour) as an adjunct to levodopa in patients with Parkinson disease (PD) and motor fluctuations. At week 24, the mean dose of ropinirole 24-hour was 18.8 mg/day with a mean reduction in daily levodopa of 278 mg. The most common adverse events (AE) with ropinirole 24-hour were dyskinesia, nausea, dizziness, somnolence, hallucinations, and orthostatic hypotension and AEs led to study withdrawal in 5% of both the active and placebo groups. Ropinirole 24-hour demonstrated an improvement in both motor and non-motor PD symptoms, while permitting a reduction in adjunctive levodopa dose.</s><s>Rasagiline mesylate is a novel drug for Parkinson's disease with selective, irreversible monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor activity, and is effective as monotherapy in early disease. Primary outcome was change in total daily off-time (intention-to-treat population). Other measures included the clinical global improvement (CGI) score and unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) scores. Both rasagiline and entacapone reduced mean daily off-time (-1.18 h rasagiline and -1.2 h entacapone vs placebo -0.4 h; p=0.0001, p<0.0001, respectively) and increased daily on-time without troublesome dyskinesia (0.85 h vs placebo 0.03 h; p=0.0005 for both). Once-daily rasagiline reduces mean daily off-time and improves symptoms of Parkinson's disease in levodopa-treated patients with motor fluctuations, an effect similar to that of entacapone.</s><s>Motor fluctuations associated with levodopa therapy are common problems encountered in the long-term treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Entacapone, a peripherally acting, reversible inhibitor of catechol-O-methyltransferase, slows the elimination of levodopa in humans by reducing the formation of 3-O-methyldopa. We conducted a placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter trial of entacapone in PD patients with motor fluctuations. The effect of entacapone was more prominent in patients with a smaller percent \"on\" time (<55%) at baseline, and increased as the day wore on.</s><s>Zydis selegiline dissolves on contact with saliva and undergoes pregastric absorption. This minimizes first-pass metabolism and provides high plasma concentrations of selegiline. In this study, the efficacy and safety of Zydis selegiline was assessed in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients who were experiencing motor fluctuations with levodopa. Patients were randomly assigned to either drug or placebo in a 2:1 ratio in this double-blind, multicenter trial. Significant reductions in daily off time occurred at 4 to 6 weeks with the 1.25 mg dose (9.9%, P = 0.003) and 10 to 12 weeks with the 2.5 mg dose (13.2%, P < 0.001).</s><s>The primary objective of this study was to assess the effect of tolcapone on levodopa dosage in parkinsonian patients whose \"wearing-off\" phenomenon has been controlled with more frequent levodopa dosage. After a 1-week placebo run-in, 97 patients were assigned randomly to receive placebo or tolcapone 200 or 400 mg three times daily (t.i.d.). After 6 weeks, the tolcapone groups crossed over to receive the other dose for a further 3 weeks for exploratory purposes. Both tolcapone groups had greater reductions in levodopa dosage than the placebo group at week 6 (not statistically different). group showed greatest improvement in estimated mean scores for all efficacy parameters (p < 0.05 versus placebo for change in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Subscale II).</s><s>We conducted a multicenter randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind parallel-group study in Japanese Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with wearing-off motor fluctuations to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of entacapone as an adjunct to concomitant treatment with levodopa and a dopa decarboxylase inhibitor (DCI). The primary efficacy variable was on time change while awake, determined by patients' diaries. Mean on time change at final assessment was 1.4 hours each for entacapone 100-mg and 200-mg groups and by 0.5 hours for the placebo group (P < 0.05). The most common adverse event with entacapone was an increase in dyskinesias.</s><s>23 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease were allocated in a double-blind study of bromocryptine. These patients had an insufficient or deteriorating response to levodopa treatment. The global assessment, both by the investigator and by the patients, also showed significant improvement. The efficacy of bromocryptine in these type of parkinsonian patients in a double-blind trial has not yet been established.</s><s>The efficacy and tolerability of entacapone was investigated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-month study of 162 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) treated with levodopa and a dopamine agonist and experiencing wearing-off motor fluctuations. Patients were monitored for adverse events, laboratory safety and vital signs throughout the study. \"Off\" time while awake (UPDRS part IV Item 39) showed an improvement of at least one category in 36% of entacapone-treated patients, compared with 22% in the control group (p = 0.0038). As expected, the most frequent adverse events were dopamine-mediated (dyskinesia: entacapone 31% versus placebo 13%), and harmless urinary discoloration. In conclusion, although the primary efficacy variable did not reach statistical significance, the present results demonstrate that entacapone provides additional antiparkinsonian benefits to levodopa therapy and is well tolerated in levodopa-treated PD patients experiencing wearing-off motor fluctuations despite adjunct dopamine agonist therapy.</s><s>We studied the new catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor tolcapone, 100 and 200 mg, three times daily (tid) in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial involving 202 parkinsonian patients who were experiencing the \"wearing-off\" phenomenon on levodopa therapy. After 3 months, patients receiving tolcapone had a significant decrease in mean daily levodopa dose requirement compared with placebo-treated patients (p < 0.01). Moreover, the number of daily levodopa intakes was reduced significantly in each tolcapone group compared with placebo (p < 0.01). Dyskinesia developed or worsened in 18% of patients receiving placebo, in 51% receiving tolcapone 100 mg tid, and in 64% receiving 200 mg tid, with most cases occurring within the first 30 days of the study. We conclude that tolcapone as an adjunct offers promise for the relief of the \"wearing-off\" phenomenon in levodopa-treated parkinsonian patients.</s><s>The use of a dopamine agonist with a long duration of action has theoretical advantages in attempting to reduce the motor fluctuations in Parkinson's disease. We report the results of a double-blind controlled study of adding cabergoline, an ergot derivative with potent long-lasting high affinity for the D2 receptor, to levodopa therapy in 37 patients with severe fluctuations in response to treatment. Increasing dosages of cabergoline (19 patients) or placebo (18 patients) were added to each patient's stable levodopa regime. However, there was no difference between the groups when comparing their average Hoehn and Yahr stage of disease, and Schwab and England activities of daily living index.</s><s>Pramipexole is a new, selective, nonergoline dopamine agonist that acts on D2 and preferentially on D3 dopamine receptors. Phase II and III clinical trials have shown this drug to be useful in treating both early and advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. A bromocriptine treatment group was included to enable comparisons between bromocriptine and placebo groups, but the study was not powered to show statistical differences between the active treatment groups. The trial included three phases: dose escalation, 6 months' maintenance, and dose reduction. Up to 4.5 mg per day of pramipexole and 30 mg per day of bromocriptine were used. The results of the study showed that the UPDRS part II improved by 26.7% for pramipexole (p = 0.0002) and 14% for bromocriptine (p = 0.02) versus 4.8% for placebo.</s><s>To compare the efficacy of levodopa/dopa decarboxylase inhibitor (DDCI) plus entacapone with levodopa/DDCI plus placebo on measures of parkinsonian disability and health-related quality of life (QoL) in subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD) experiencing motor fluctuations. However, no significant differences were observed between treatments using the PDQ-39 summary index. UPDRS part III (motor) scores significantly decreased in the levodopa/DDCI/entacapone group compared with the levodopa/DDCI/placebo group (-5.0 vs -2.9, respectively; P = 0.03). Levodopa combined with entacapone demonstrated good efficacy in terms of ADL, global function, motor performance and was well tolerated. However, this short-term study did not generate significant improvements in QoL.</s><s>To determine the therapeutic effect of levodopa/benserazide and tolcapone on gait in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. Instrumental gait analysis was performed in 38 out of 40 patients with wearing-off phenomenon during a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of tolcapone. With respect to levodopa/benserazide effect, the reduction in rigidity correlated with improved angular excursion of the ankle, whereas the decreased bradykinesia correlated with improved stride length and angular excursion of the hip and knee joints.</s><s>To study the effect of entacapone, a specific peripherally acting catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor used in combination with levodopa treatment, in cases of Parkinson's disease with both fluctuating and non-fluctuating response to treatment. The clinical efficacy and safety of 200 mg entacapone given with each daily levodopa dose was studied. The primary efficacy variable for fluctuating patients-the proportion of daily ON time-showed a significant increase compared with placebo (p < 0.05). The absolute ON time (mean (SD)) increased from 9.5 (2.5) to 10.8 (2.4) hours (p < 0.01), and the daily OFF time was correspondingly reduced from 7.0 (2.6) to 5.9 (2.5) hours (p < 0.05 v placebo). This improvement was achieved despite a reduction in daily levodopa requirements. Entacapone was well tolerated by both fluctuating and non-fluctuating patients. The ability of entacapone to provide additional benefits to levodopa treatment in increasing ON time in fluctuating Parkinson's disease patients was confirmed.</s><s>Continuous dopaminergic drug delivery is an unmet medical need in advanced Parkinson's disease. Primary efficacy variables were absolute change in total hours \"off\" (assessed by home diaries) from baseline to end of study and responder rate (defined as the proportion of patients with >or=30% reduction in absolute off time per day). This trial is registered with the US National Institutes of Health clinical trials database (ClinicalTrials.gov), number NCT00244387. The number of discontinuations in each group was similar; most were for adverse events. Mean absolute change in off time from baseline was -2.5 h (SE 0.20) with rotigotine, -2.8 h (0.20) with pramipexole, and -0.9 h (0.29) with placebo. In terms of change in absolute off time, rotigotine was non-inferior to pramipexole. Continuous delivery of rotigotine as transdermal patches could offer similar efficacy to oral pramipexole in patients with fluctuating Parkinson's disease over 6 months of treatment.</s><s>Rasagiline (n-propargyl-1[R]-aminoindan) mesylate is a novel irreversible selective monoamine oxidase type B inhibitor, previously demonstrated to improve symptoms in early Parkinson disease (PD). Multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study. Change from baseline in total daily off time measured by patients' home diaries during 26 weeks of treatment, percentage of patients completing 26 weeks of treatment, and adverse event frequency. Compared with placebo, patients treated with 1.0 mg/d rasagiline had 0.94 hour less off time per day, and patients treated with 0.5 mg/d rasagiline had 0.49 hour less off time per day. Prespecified secondary end points also improved during rasagiline treatment, including scores on an investigator-rated clinical global impression scale and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (activities of daily living in the off state and motor performance in the \"on\" state). Rasagiline improves motor fluctuations and PD symptoms in levodopa-treated PD patients.</s><s>The objective of this study was to test the impact of entacapone (ENT) addition to levodopa with a decarboxylase inhibitor (LD) in full-time-employed patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), focusing on retirement rates, medical absenteeism, self-perception of disability, as well as motor assessments of parkinsonism, motor fluctuations, and dyskinesias. Thirty full-time-employed PD patients (disease onset before age 60 years) and on optimized monotherapy with LD exhibiting minor motor fluctuations or dyskinesias were entered into a 2-year randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study of ENT adjunctive therapy. The outcome measures were the number of full-time-employed patients at study end, cumulative days of medical absenteeism, patient-completed disability assessments, diary records, and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-based measures of motor fluctuations and dyskinesias.</s><s>Pramipexole, a non-ergot dopamine D2/D3 receptor agonist, was investigated as an add on drug in advanced parkinsonian patients with motor fluctuations to assess efficacy, safety, and tolerance. Safety and tolerability were assessed on the basis of adverse events, vital signs, laboratory measurements, and ECG recordings. There was a significant improvement of the pramipexole group in UPDRS total scores, subscores part II, III (activities of daily living and motor examination), and IV (complications of therapy). Mean UPDRS total score decreased by 37.3% under pramipexole compared with 12.2% under placebo (p<0.001).</s><s>A double-blind, placebo-controlled study with a subsequent open-label phase was conducted in 354 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and motor fluctuations under individually adjusted therapy with levodopa. In agreement with previous studies, pramipexole treatment improved UPDRS sum scores of parts II and III by 30% and off times by approximately 2.5 hours per day. We, furthermore, performed post hoc analyses with respect to resting tremor and depression. Patients with pronounced resting tremor derived a clear benefit from pramipexole treatment compared with placebo. There were 262 patients who were subsequently enrolled into the open-label study featuring a maximum duration of up to 57 months.</s><s>Patients with moderately severe Parkinson's disease complicated by the adverse effects of chronic levodopa use benefited from the addition of bromocriptine (Parlodel; Sandoz) in doses up to 26 mg daily, which allowed an approximate 30% reduction of levodopa dose. Increased effectiveness in these patients was not associated with increased dosage beyond 25-30 mg daily. When the doses of bromocriptine were increased slowly, the adverse reactions were minor and usually transient.</s><s>To study the effect and safety of entacapone as an adjunct to levodopa treatment in patients with PD with wearing-off motor fluctuations. A total of 171 parkinsonian patients with wearing-off-type motor fluctuations participated in a 6-month randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study. The extent of therapeutic response was elicited in the first hand with home diary recordings of \"on\" and \"off\" times by the patient and with Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale scoring by the examiner. The patients took either 200 mg entacapone or identical placebos concomitantly with each daily levodopa dose (four to 10 times a day). The daily levodopa dose was reduced significantly in the entacapone group, the difference between the groups being 102 mg (p < 0.01). Dopaminergic adverse events, which increased, were ameliorated by reducing the levodopa dose. Long-term entacapone treatment effectively prolonged the beneficial response to levodopa in parkinsonian patients with the wearing-off phenomenon.</s><s>To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the non-ergot dopamine agonist pramipexole in untreated and levodopa-treated Chinese patients with early or advanced Parkinson's disease. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, which was conducted in Hong Kong and Taiwan, comprised a screening period of at least 1 week, a dose-escalation period of 7 weeks, and a maintenance period of 8 weeks (total duration of treatment: 15 weeks). Efficacy was primarily assessed by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Mean scores for pramipexole patients not on levodopa showed a greater improvement than did pramipexole patients on levodopa. The mean improvement for the pramipexole/no levodopa group relative to the placebo/no levodopa group at week 15 was 10.93 points (i.e., -14.43 points minus -3.50 points). Pramipexole was also superior to placebo as measured by improvement in the modified Hoehn and Yahr Scale and a reduction in the number of \"off\" hours for patients on concomitant levodopa therapy.</s><s>More than 50% of patients with Parkinson's disease develop motor response fluctuations (the \"wearing off\" phenomenon) after more than five years of levodopa therapy. Inhibition of catechol-O-methyltransferase by tolcapone has been shown to increase levodopa bioavailability and plasma elimination half life, thereby prolonging the efficacy of levodopa. After three months with 200 mg tolcapone tid, \"off\" time decreased by 26.2% of the baseline value, \"on\" time increased by 20.6% (P<O.01 v placebo), and the mean total daily levodopa dose decreased by 122 mg from the baseline dose of 676 mg (P<0.01). With 100 mg tolcapone tid, \"off\" time decreased by 31.5% (P<0.05), \"on\" time increased by 21.3% (P<0.01), and the mean total daily levodopa dose decreased by 109 mg from the baseline dose of 668 mg (P<0.05). Tolcapone prolongs \"on\" time in fluctuating parkinsonian patients while allowing a reduction in daily levodopa dosage, thereby improving the efficacy of long term levodopa therapy.</s><s>To determine the efficacy and safety of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor entacapone, used as an adjunct to levodopa, in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. The 24-week treatment period was followed by 2 weeks of entacapone withdrawal. In fluctuating patients, 'on' time increased (1.7 h) and 'off' time decreased (1.5 h) significantly more with entacapone than with placebo (0.5 and 0.6 h, respectively; P < 0.05), and the daily levodopa dose was reduced by 54 mg with entacapone and increased by 27 mg with placebo (P < 0.05). Entacapone efficacy was comparable between patients using CR and standard levodopa preparations.</s><s>To evaluate the nonergot dopamine agonist ropinirole as an adjunct to L-dopa in a randomized, double-blind trial in PD patients with motor fluctuations. L-dopa in the treatment of PD is associated with motor fluctuations, dyskinesia, and other adverse effects. The mean daily L-dopa dose was reduced significantly with ropinirole treatment (242 mg versus 51 mg; p < 0.001) as was the percent awake time spent \"off\" (11.7% versus 5.1%; p = 0.039). There was no difference in the percent of patients who withdrew because of adverse effects (15.8% on ropinirole versus 16.7% on placebo). Ropinirole permits a reduction in L-dopa dose with enhanced clinical benefit for PD patients with motor fluctuations.</s><s>Cabergoline is a dopaminergic agonist relatively specific for the D2 receptor and much longer-acting than other dopamine agonists. The daily levodopa dose for the cabergoline patients decreased 18% compared with a 3% reduction for the placebo group (p < 0.001). The side-effect was similar to that seen with other dopamine agonists, and cabergoline was generally well tolerated. We conclude that cabergoline is an effective adjunct to levodopa for the treatment of PD.</s><s>To assess the efficacy and tolerability of the catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor tolcapone in reducing \"off/on\" fluctuations in levodopa-treated parkinsonian patients. Two hundred fifteen referred outpatients with Parkinson disease who showed predictable end-of-dose motor fluctuations that were not controlled by a stable levodopa-carbidopa (Sinemet) regimen of at least 4 weeks' duration. Tolcapone, 100 and 200 mg 3 times daily, reduced off time by 2.0 and 2.5 hours per day, respectively, and increased on time by 2.1 and 2.3 hours per day, respectively (P<.001 vs placebo). Principal adverse events (mainly dyskinesia and nausea) were levodopa related, were not treatment limiting, and were seldom reported as reasons for withdrawal. The frequency of withdrawals because of adverse events was similar in all groups (3% to 7%).</s><s>Tolcapone is a potent catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor that prolongs the plasma half-life of levodopa. This multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study used two 10-hour clinical evaluations to compare the efficacy and safety of three doses of tolcapone (50, 200, and 400 mg tid) with placebo in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) experiencing motor fluctuations from levodopa/carbidopa. Tolcapone was well tolerated, with patients experiencing typical dopaminergic side effects that could be reduced or eliminated by lowering levodopa/carbidopa dosages.</s><s>Forty patients with severe Parkinson's disease (23 men, 17 women) who had been treated for six years with L-dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor, were part of a placebo-controlled double-blind trial to test the effectiveness of bromocriptin. In all patients the effectiveness of L-dopa had been decreasing, 34 patients had L-dopa-induced dyskinesias, 35 \"on-off\" symptoms. Bromocriptin dosage was gradually increased to a total dose of 30 - 40 mg daily. The symptoms of Parkinson's disease were favourably influenced, with rigor, tremor and also walking disturbances responding better than bradykinesia of the hands.</s><s>Deprenyl, a selective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase, type B, which is free of the \"tyramine effect,\" may ameliorate symptom fluctuations in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). We randomized 96 patients with marked symptom fluctuations at three centers to receive either deprenyl 5 mg b.i.d. Disability was recorded hourly at home by patients 3 days weekly during the 2-week baseline and the 6-week treatment period. Mean hourly self-assessment of gait improved in 28 of 50 patients (56%) receiving deprenyl (mean degree of improvement 0.25 points on a 0-2 scale) and in 14 of 46 (30.4%) taking placebo (mean 0.15).</s><s>Rasagiline mesylate (TVP-1012) is a potent, selective, non-reversible MAO-B inhibitor, without the tyramine-potentiating effect and with neuroprotective activities. To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and clinical effect of rasagiline as adjunctive therapy to levodopa, a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/d) was conducted for 12 weeks in 70 patients with PD (mean age, 57.4 y; mean disease duration, 5.7 y; 32 patients had motor fluctuations). The treatment effect was still evident 6 weeks after drug discontinuation (in all doses). This study has demonstrated that rasagiline (up to 2 mg/day) has a good safety profile and a beneficial clinical effect in fluctuating patients with PD when given as an add-on to chronic levodopa therapy.</s><s>The safety of entacapone combined with levodopa and a dopadecarboxylase (DDC) inhibitor was tested in a 12-month double-blind study of 326 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). Entacapone was well tolerated with a discontinuation rate due to AEs of 14% compared with 11% with placebo (NS). Dryness of mouth, urine discoloration and diarrhoea were more frequent non-dopaminergic AEs with entacapone than with placebo. The interval between the first two morning doses of levodopa increased by 17% with entacapone, whereas with placebo no extension was observed (P < 0.05). As further evidence of efficacy, Parkinsonian symptoms markedly worsened in all patients after withdrawal of entacapone. Monitoring of liver or other safety parameters during entacapone treatment is not required.</s><s>Forty-six patients with Parkinson's disease experiencing motor fluctuations and not optimally controlled on levodopa received as adjunct therapy a new nonergoline dopamine agonist, ropinirole, in a 3-month randomized placebo-controlled trial. Ropinirole significantly reduced the duration of off periods as assessed by self-scoring diary cards. More patients withdrew because of adverse events or insufficient therapeutic effect in the placebo group.</s><s>The effects of bromocriptine in patients with Parkinson's disease manifesting various problems in levodopa therapy were tested in a double-blind manner with the collaboration of 59 institutions. Twenty-nine % of the bromocriptine-treated patients (n = 108), in contrast to 14.8% of the placebo-treated (n = 108), showed either marked or moderate improvement (P less than 0.05).</s><s>Three hundred and seventy-six subjects with advanced Parkinson's disease participated in a prospective, double-blind placebo-controlled study of the dopamine agonist pergolide mesylate as an adjunct to Sinemet.

However, the safety of discontinuing prophylaxis against Mycobacterium avium complex has been uncertain. Mycobacterium avium complex cultures, CD4(+) cell counts, and clinical evaluations for AIDS-defining illnesses and bacterial infections were done every 8 weeks. During follow-up (median, 16 months), 2 cases of M. avium complex infection were reported among the 321 patients assigned to placebo (incidence rate, 0.5 event per 100 person-years [95% CI, 0.06 to 1.83 events per 100 person-years]) compared with no cases among the 322 patients assigned to azithromycin (CI, 0 to 0.92 events per 100 person-years), resulting in a treatment difference of 0.5 event per 100 person-years (CI, -0.20 to 1.21 events per 100 person-years) for placebo versus azithromycin.</s><s>Several agents are effective in preventing Mycobacterium avium complex disease in patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. However, there is uncertainty about whether prophylaxis should be continued in patients whose CD4+ cell counts have increased substantially with antiviral therapy. During follow-up over a median period of 12 months, there were no episodes of confirmed M. avium complex disease in either group (95 percent confidence interval for the rate of disease in each group, 0 to 1.5 episodes per 100 person-years). Neither the rate of progression of HIV disease nor the mortality rate differed significantly between the two groups. Adverse effects led to discontinuation of the study drug in 19 patients assigned to receive azithromycin (7.4 percent) and in 3 assigned to receive placebo (1.1 percent; relative risk, 6.6; P=0.002).</s><s>We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial of azithromycin (1,200 mg once weekly) for the prevention of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection in patients with AIDS and a CD4 cell count of < 100/mm3. There was no difference in the ranges of minimal inhibitory concentrations of either clarithromycin or azithromycin for the five breakthrough (first) MAC isolates from the azithromycin group and the 18 breakthrough MAC isolates from the placebo group. Of the 76 patients who died during the study, four (10.5%) of 38 azithromycin recipients and 12 (31.6%) of 38 placebo recipients had a MAC infection followed by death (P = .025). For deaths due to all causes, there was no difference in time to death or number of deaths between the two groups. Azithromycin given once weekly is safe and effective in preventing disseminated MAC infection, death due to MAC infection, and respiratory tract infections in patients with AIDS and CD4 cell counts of < 100/mm3.</s><s>Disseminated infection with Mycobacterium avium complex is the most common opportunistic infection in patients with advanced stages of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).

Labour and delivery were carried out by a medical team different from that which set up the Anesthelec. To define the effects of this new method, maternal and foetal parameters of 50 deliveries carried out under Anesthelec were compared with 50 deliveries carried out under epidural analgesia. Good acceptance and satisfaction for the mother should allow a rapid evolution of this new method.</s><s>The effectiveness of transcutaneous nerve stimulation (TENS) for pain relief in labour was evaluated by randomizing 280 patients in early labour into 2 groups. Neither patients nor attending labour ward staff were aware of which group the patient was in. The intensity of low back pain and abdominal pain was assessed by the patient each hour on a visual analogue pain scale. We conclude that TENS is ineffective as a routine method of pain relief in labour. It is likely to benefit only those with severe back pain and then only to a modest degree.</s><s>Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is one of the non-pharmacological means of pain relief for labor and delivery. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned healthy full-term parturients in active phase of first-stage labor to either TENS on four acupuncture points (Hegu [Li 4] and Sanyinjiao [Sp 6]) (n=52) or the TENS placebo (n=53). Visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to assess pain before and 30 and 60 min after treatment.

The duration of the spinal portion of the CSE did not differ between groups (TENS off 91.1+/-33 [mean +/- SD] vs. TENS on 83.1+/-28 min, P = .42).

There were highly significant differences between the TENS and the TENS placebo users in terms of favourable and unfavourable comments by the mothers and the midwives at 1 and 24 h after delivery. The evident consumer satisfaction for TENS suggests TENS has a part to play in analgesia in labour but the equivocal findings in terms of factors associated with pain relief points to the need for apparatus more specifically designed to cope with the special characteristics of the pain of labour.</s><s>To evaluate whether transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) can increase the quality and duration of an initiation dose of bupivacaine used for the establishment of epidural labor analgesia. 40 ASA physical status I and II parturients in early, active spontaneous labor with a singleton, vertex term fetus, and requesting analgesia. Before epidural placement, TENS intensity thresholds were determined with electrodes placed over the paraspinus muscles at T(10)-L(1), and S(2)-S(4); TENS settings for mode, cycle, and pulse width were standardized.

        "Abstracts": "<s>Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) has the risk of renal dysfunction. Sixty patients with normal preoperative renal functions undergoing CABG were randomly assigned to conventional revascularization with CPB (on-pump) or beating heart revascularization (off-pump). Creatinine clearance was found to be significantly higher in the off-pump group than in the on-pump group (p<.05). No significant differences were found in the prevalence of postoperative hemodialysis.</s><s>Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery is associated with systemic inflammation. This prospective randomized study compares neutrophil activation in patients undergoing OPCAB versus those undergoing CABG with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Central venous blood samples were obtained before skin incision and at 15 minutes, 60 minutes, 2 hours, 5 hours, and 24 hours following the initiation of CPB or application of the stabilization device. Differential white cell counts were measured with routine laboratory techniques. The 2 groups were matched with respect to preoperative and operative characteristics. White cell and neutrophil counts rose in both groups following the operation but were significantly higher in the OPCAB group at 5 hours (P < .001 and P = .002, respectively). Interleukin 8 concentrations were significantly higher in the CPB group at 5 hours following the initiation of CPB (P = .034).</s><s>Hyperglycaemia is associated with increased mortality and morbidity after cardiac surgery. While surgical stress results in hyperglycaemia after all operations, it has been suggested that cardiopulmonary bypass is the dominating contributor after cardiac surgery. Patients scheduled for primary coronary artery bypass grafting were randomised to surgery with or without cardiopulmonary bypass. All patients received continuous insulin infusions during the initial 24-h period. Serum insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1 and its binding protein were determined. Average blood glucose during the day of surgery did not differ between groups, but 30% more insulin (P=0.003) was required when cardiopulmonary bypass was used. Fasting blood glucose was still equally elevated 20-30% in both groups on the third postoperative day. Glucose homeostasis is disturbed preoperatively for many non-diabetic patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery.</s><s>This prospective randomized study aimed to compare beating and arrested heart revascularization in patients undergoing first elective coronary artery bypass graft, with cardiac troponin I release used to evaluate myocardial injury. Seventy patients were randomly assigned to a beating or arrested heart revascularization group. Cardiac troponin I concentrations were significantly higher in the arrested heart group at hours 6, 9, 12, and 24 than in the beating heart group (p < 0.0001). The lower release of cardiac troponin I in the beating heart revascularization group indicates that conventional coronary artery bypass graft with cardioplegic arrest causes more damage to the heart than off-pump myocardial revascularization.</s><s>We investigated whether off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) surgery should be the procedure of choice in total arterial myocardial revascularization with composite grafts. We prospectively enrolled 176 patients undergoing total arterial myocardial revascularization and assigned them at random to one of two groups: group 1 was composed of 88 patients undergoing coronary surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB); group 2 consisted of 88 patients receiving the OPCAB procedure. We excluded from this study patients with significant risk factors for CPB-related morbidity. Mean number of anastomoses was similar in both groups (group 1 = 2.8 +/- 0.8, group 2 = 2.7 +/- 0.5) whereas mean mechanical ventilation time (group 1 = 23 +/- 9 hours, group 2 = 9 +/- 4 hours), intensive care unit stay (group 1 = 43 +/- 6 hours, group 2 = 22 +/- 8 hours), and postoperative stay (group 1 = 7 +/- 3 days, group 2 = 5 +/- 2 days) were significantly reduced in group 2. Early mortality was 2.3% in group 1 and 3.4% in group 2 (p = not significant). Off-pump coronary artery surgery could be successfully used for total arterial grafting without compromising the completeness of revascularization.</s><s>to serially determine endothelin (ET) levels in arterial vascular compartments in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery using either cardiopulmonary bypass or off-pump techniques, and (2). Postoperative systemic arterial ET levels were significantly increased by 200% in the CPB group and 50% in the OPCAB group. ET levels remained significantly higher in the CPB group relative to the OPCAB group throughout the postoperative period of observation (p < 0.05). Postoperative ET levels were higher in patients who underwent CPB for coronary artery bypass surgery.</s><s>To evaluate off-pump versus on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in patients with three-vessel disease and a high-risk operative profile. Main exclusion criteria were previous heart surgery, poor left ventricular function (ejection fraction <30%), or unstable preoperative condition. An insignificant trend towards a reduction in myocardial infarction after off-pump CABG was observed (7% vs 14%; HR 0.53, 95% CI: 0.27 to 1.04; p=0.06). No significant difference in the primary outcome of MACCE was found between off-pump and on-pump CABG.</s><s>Off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting reduces postoperative morbidity and uses fewer resources than conventional surgical intervention with cardiopulmonary bypass. Patency was assessed by using multidetector computed tomographic coronary angiographic analysis with a 16-slice scanner. Major adverse cardiac-related events and health-related quality of life were obtained from questionnaires given to participants and family practitioners. Patency was studied in 199 and health-related quality of life was studied in 299 of 349 survivors. The likelihood of graft occlusion was no different between off-pump coronary artery bypass (10.6%) and coronary artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass (11.0%) groups (odds ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.55-1.81; P > .99). Long-term health outcomes with off-pump coronary artery bypass are similar to those with coronary artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass when both operations are performed by experienced surgeons.</s><s>The effect of the use of coronary-artery bypass surgery without cardiopulmonary bypass and cardiac arrest (\"off pump\") on graft patency remains uncertain. We undertook a prospective, randomized, controlled study to compare graft-patency rates and clinical outcomes in off-pump surgery with conventional, \"on-pump\" surgery. Three months later, the patients underwent coronary angiography, including quantitative analysis. There was no significant difference in the median postoperative length of stay between the two groups (seven days in each group). At three months, 127 of 130 grafts were patent in the on-pump group (98 percent), as compared with 114 of 130 in the off-pump group (88 percent, P=0.002). However, the graft-patency rate was lower at three months in the off-pump group than in the on-pump group, and this difference has implications with respect to the long-term outcome.</s><s>To assess neurocognitive impairment after the off-pump and on-pump techniques for coronary artery bypass graft surgery in patients with triple vessel disease. Change in scores in nine standard neuropsychometric tests administered preoperatively and at 1 and 10 weeks postoperatively. The on-pump group showed a significantly greater deterioration in scores for two and three tests at 1 week and 10 weeks postoperatively, respectively, than the off-pump group.</s><s>The subset of patients most likely to benefit from off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) remains a controversial issue, but the technique has been proposed to decrease postoperative mortality and morbidity. Th e objective of this study was to compare off-pump to onpump CABG in patients with known risk factors for mortality and morbidity. Twenty-eight patients averaging 70 +/- 8 years of age underwent 3 +/- 1 grafts off pump, and 37 patients averaging 70 +/- 6 years of age underwent 3.4 +/- 1 grafts on pump. Two offpump (7%) compared to 11 on-pump (30%) of patients presented composite end-points including death, neurological injury, renal failure, respiratory failure, and operative myocardial infarction after CABG (P =.02). The present study suggests that off-pump CABG, when technically feasible, significantly reduces morbidity following surgery in a group of high-risk patients.</s><s>This study investigated whether off-pump coronary bypass graft operations on the beating heart under normothermic conditions reduces the systemic oxidative stress and inflammatory reaction seen in patients operated under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). A cardiac stabilizer (Octopus Tissue Stabilizer; Medtronic Inc, Minneapolis, MN) was used to perform the coronary anastomoses on the normothermic beating heart with or without CPB. In contrast, the rise of these factors was blunted in patients operated without CPB. Off-pump coronary bypass graft operation on a beating heart significantly reduces oxidative stress and suppresses the inflammatory reaction associated with the use of CPB.</s><s>The aim of this preliminary, prospective, randomized study was to compare rotation thromboelastography (roTEG) results and D-dimer levels in off-pump versus on-pump coronary surgery in order to identify the activation of fibrinolysis. Twenty patients scheduled for coronary bypass grafting were assessed (off-pump group A, n = 10; on-pump group B, n = 10). Blood samples for roTEG examination were taken preoperatively (t0), 15 minutes after sternotomy (t1), on the completion of peripheral bypass anastomoses (t2), and at the end of procedures (t3). A certain degree of roTEG signs of fibrinolysis was noticed at time t2 in both groups and in group B these marks were quite widely, but not significantly expressed (P for intergroup differences for Lysis on Set Time at 60 and 150 minutes were P = 0.190 and P = 0.122, respectively), borderline differences were found for Maximum Clot Firmness (P = 0.082) with a lower mean value for group B (arithmetic means [95% confidence intervals]--57.7 [54.2; 61.2] mm). Completely expressed roTEG signs of hyperfibrinolysis were observed in 2 patients from group B.</s><s>Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is widely regarded as an important contributor to renal failure, a well recognized complication following coronary artery surgery (coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)). We examine the extent of renal glomerular and tubular injury in low-risk patients undergoing either OPCAB or on-pump coronary artery bypass (ONCAB). Serum Cr and blood urea remained normal in both groups throughout the study. These trends were also observed with urinary microalbumin:Cr (5.05+/-2.66 vs. 6.77+/-5.76; P=0.22). Group B patients had a significantly more negative fluid balance on postoperative day 2 (-183+/-1118 vs. 637+/-847 ml; P=0.03). Although renal complication or serum markers of kidney dysfunction were absent, sensitive indicators revealed significant and similar injury to renal tubules and glomeruli following either OPCAB or ONCAB.</s><s>The aim of this randomised, prospective study was to evaluate hospital mortality and morbidity after myocardial revascularisation, comparing on-pump coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) myocardial revascularisation versus off-pump coronary artery bypass graft (OPCAB) myocardial revascularisation in population with multivessels coronary artery disease. In the results only difference we did find postoperatively was in Creatine Kinase-MB (CK-MB) release, the amount of bleeding and intensive care unit (ICU) stay (p<0.05). In summary, we didn't find no superiority in any of the two techniques regarding on hospital mortality and morbidity.</s><s>Leukocyte activation is thought to be responsible for the adverse effects and postoperative complications following cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). A novel cell surface molecule, CD97, is a sensitive marker of leukocyte and primary lymphocyte activation. The present study aimed to determine the activation of different leukocyte subsets by comparing the expression of CD97 and adhesion molecules (CD11, CD18) in patients receiving coronary surgery with or without CPB. 30 patients were enrolled and scheduled for coronary bypass surgery under CPB (20 patients, group A) and with off-pump (OP) operation (10 patients, group B). Blood samples were taken before and during surgery, and over the following first week. The findings about CD97 expression suggest considerable leukocyte activation following coronary bypass with CPB compared to OP surgery.</s><s>It is well known that conventional coronary revascularization is associated with a pronounced systemic inflammatory response due to the application of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). To compare the effects of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with (on-pump) or without (off-pump) extra-corporeal circulation observing certain inflammatory response parameters. TWENTY PATIENTS UNDERGOING CABG WITH (CPB GROUP: 10 patients) or without (off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting [OPCAB] group: 10 patients) CPB were enrolled in this prospective, randomized study. Blood samples were collected three times during the operation and on postoperative days 1, 2, 3 and 7. There was a significant difference in WBC and neutrophil counts between the two groups of patients on postoperative day 7. A significant difference in the level of TNF-alpha was found between the two groups on postoperative day 2 (P<0.05). An intense increase was observed with CPB, which significantly exceeded the values of the OPCAB group without extracorporeal circulation in the early postoperative period.</s><s>Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is a newly identified acute phase reactant with non-redundant functions in innate immunity. The purpose of this study was to assess the kinetics of release of PTX3 in cardiac surgical patients, operated on either with or without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Thirty-four patients, seventeen in each group, were randomly assigned to CABG surgery performed either with (\"on-pump\") or without (\"off-pump\") CPB. Blood samples were collected both during and after the operation up to the 7(th) day. In contrast to CPB patients, however, PTX3 levels in the latter group declined slowly, remaining elevated as long as the 3(rd) postoperative day (p<0.042).</s><s>Oxidative stress occurs in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass operation. The aim of this study was to investigate the difference in oxidative stress in off-pump versus on-pump coronary artery bypass surgery. Similarly, SOD levels also elevated significantly from 661.58 +/- 78.70 U/g Hb before anesthesia and 659.42 +/- 81.21 U/g Hb anesthesia induction to 678.08 +/- 75.80 U/g Hb after ischemia (p < 0.01, p < 0.01, respectively). Glutathione peroxidase levels were not changed according to blood collection times in both of CABG group or OPCAB group (p > 0.05).</s><s>Both cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and operative trauma are associated with increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines. We assessed the relative contribution of CPB on activation of various proinflammatory cytokines in patients undergoing coronary revascularization by comparing them with patients receiving coronary artery bypass grafts using off-pump (OPCAB) techniques. Twenty-six patients were assigned to either the OPCAB procedure using a suction device and regular sternotomy (n = 13) or were treated conventionally using extracorporeal circulation, blood cardioplegia and hypothermic arrest (29-31 degrees C; n = 13). C-reactive protein and systemic levels of TNF-alpha, TNF specific receptors Rp1 and Rp2, Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and soluble IL-2 receptors (sIL-2r) were assayed by ELISA or EIA. Coronary revascularization with CPB was associated with a significant expression increase in the TNF-system and sIL-2r when compared to the OPCAB patients. This may contribute to improved organ function, subsequently resulting in improved postoperative recovery from surgical revascularization procedures, particularly in critically ill patients.</s><s>Cardiac operations using extracorporeal circulation bear a risk of cerebral complications. Both groups were similar regarding age, sex, ejection fraction, and number of anastomoses. S100 levels were measured from induction of anesthesia until 24 hours after the operation. Nonfatal myocardial infarctions occurred in 2 patients in group A, and 1 patient in group B required resternotomy for bleeding. Peak S100 levels were four times higher in group A than in group B (2.1 microg/L versus 0.5 microg/L; p < 001). The results of our study suggest that perioperative cerebral impairment is reduced in cardiac operations without the use of extracorporeal circulation.</s><s>Pulmonary dysfunction is still a major problem in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Fifty eight patients with severe obstructive pulmonary disease had elective isolated coronary surgery. The average stay in the intensive care unit was significantly longer in group 1 (2.6 +/- 1.5 days) than in groups 2 (1.4 +/- 0.8 days) and 3 (1.1 +/- 0.8 days) (p < 0.05). Forced expiratory volumes in 1 second (FEV1) obtained in the second postoperative month were significantly lower than preoperative values only in group 1 (p < 0.05). These patients can be operated on using the beating heart technique or by using MIDCABG to prevent side effects of CPB on pulmonary function and effects of sternotomy.</s><s>Right ventricular assist devices (RVADs) have been proposed to improve exposure of the coronary arteries in off-pump surgery. Serial blood samples were collected postoperatively, for analysis of inflammatory markers, troponin I, protein S100, and free hemoglobin. Free hemoglobin levels immediately after the operation, peak and total S100 levels, and N-acetyl-glucosaminidase activity were also significantly higher in the CPB group. Off-pump coronary revascularization, with or without RVAD, reduces inflammatory response, myocardial, neurologic, and renal injury, and decreases hemolysis when compared with conventional surgery with CPB and cardioplegic arrest.</s><s>Conventional cardioplegic arrest coronary artery bypass grafting after ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction is associated with high mortality and morbidity. This study randomly evaluated the impact of the off-pump technique on clinical results. Between February 2002 and October 2007, 128 patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction who underwent myocardial revascularization within 48 hours from the onset of symptoms were randomly assigned to 2 groups: on-pump group (66 patients/51.5%) and off-pump group (63 patients/48.5%). In-hospital mortality was 7.7% (5 patients) in the on-pump group and 1.6% (1 patient) in the off-pump group (P = .04). The serum levels of cardiac troponin I were high in the on-pump group during the first 48 hours after surgery. There were no cardiac-related late deaths, and patients had no recurrent cardiac events.</s><s>This prospective randomized study sought to verify the systemic inflammatory response, inflammatory myocardial damage, and early clinical outcome in coronary surgery with the miniaturized extracorporeal circulation system or on the beating heart. Plasma levels of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were measured from systemic blood intraoperatively, at the end of operation, and 24 and 48 hours thereafter. Levels of the same markers and blood lactate were measured from coronary sinus blood intraoperatively to evaluate myocardial inflammation. There was no statistical difference in early clinical outcome in both groups. Levels of creatine kinase mass were statistically higher in the miniaturized extracorporeal circulation group than in the off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting group, but only at the end of the operation (P < .0001).</s><s>Cardiac surgery is followed by various degrees of inflammation, which have harmful consequences. Four groups of similar patients underwent coronary surgery: (group 1) on-pump, EC with closed surface modifying additives (SMA) circuit and no pump suckers (n = 20); (group 2) on-pump, EC with open SMA circuit and pump suckers (n = 20); (group 3) off-pump (beating heart) and heparin 3 mg/kg (n = 20); (group 4) off-pump (beating heart) and heparin 1 mg/kg (n = 20). No significant difference in myeloperoxydase content was noted; however, elastase was significantly higher in the two EC (on-pump) groups.</s><s>We sought to investigate the release pattern of different cardiac biomarkers (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, cardiac troponin I, heart-type fatty acid-binding protein, creatine kinase-MB, and myoglobin) and to establish the diagnostic discrimination limits of each marker protein to evaluate perioperative myocardial injury in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with or without cardiopulmonary bypass. Fifty patients were randomly assigned to on-pump or off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of cardiac biomarkers indicated cardiac troponin I and heart-type fatty acid-binding protein as the superior diagnostic discriminators of myocardial injury, with an optimal cutoff value of greater than 0.92 ng/mL (area under the curve, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.88-1.00]; sensitivity, 92%; specificity, 92%; likelihood ratio [+], 11.50) and greater than 6.8 ng/mL (area under the curve, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.88-1.00]; sensitivity, 88%; specificity, 88%; likelihood ratio [+], 7.33), respectively. Off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting provides better myocardial protection than on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting. Cardiac troponin I and heart-type fatty acid-binding protein, but not high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, served as superior diagnostic discriminators of perioperative myocardial damage after on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting.</s><s>Previous randomized comparisons of off-pump and on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) have yielded controversial results about the cardiac and neurological events and graft patency. In addition, these randomized studies were composed of CABG with a few arterial grafts. The clinical outcomes and S-100 protein, neuron-specific enolase, and maximum creatine kinase-MB levels were compared. Early graft patency was examined within 3 weeks after the operation by angiography. The number of grafts performed per patient (3.5+/-1.0 for off-pump CABG and 3.6+/-0.9 for on-pump CABG) and the number of arterial grafts performed per patient (3.3+/-1.0 for off-pump CABG and 3.4+/-0.9 for on-pump CABG) were similar. Completeness of revascularization (completed grafts/planned grafts) was 98% in both procedures. The neuron-specific enolase levels at the intensive care unit admission were significantly (P<0.001) lower in the off-pump group than in the on-pump group (10.4+/-9.0 ng/mL versus 16.9+/-6.9 ng/mL). The stenosis-free patency rate in the right coronary area was significantly (P=0.028) worse in the off-pump CABG group (90%) than in the on-pump group (99%). Off-pump CABG with multiple arterial grafts was as safe as the conventional on-pump CABG, with similar completeness of revascularization and early graft patency.</s><s>In a previous study, we showed that oxygenation was impaired for up to 5 day after conventional coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). As cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) may have a detrimental effect on pulmonary function, we hypothesized that coronary revascularization grafting without the use of CPB (OPCAB) would affect post-operative oxygenation and release of inflammatory mediators less compared with CABG. Systemic release of interleukin (IL)-6, -8 and -10, C-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophils were measured in peripheral blood samples for up to 3 days post-operatively. OPCAB was followed by a higher shunt (P = 0.047), with no difference (P = 0.47) in the deterioration of DeltaPO(2) between the groups. When comparing OPCAB with CABG, oxygenation was more affected and only part of the systemic inflammatory response was attenuated.</s><s>Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is associated with gut mucosal hypoxia, which may contribute to gastrointestinal complications. Fifty-four patients undergoing primary CABG by the same surgeon were randomized into either on-pump (ONCAB, n=27) or off-pump (OPCAB, n=27) groups. The ONCAB group underwent mild hypothermic (35 degrees C) pulsatile CPB with arterial line filtration. Each patient underwent perioperative monitoring with continuous tonometry and cardiac output devices. Gastric intramucosal pH (pHi), gastric-arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure difference (CO(2) gap), whole-body oxygen delivery (DO(2)) and consumption (VO(2)) and whole-body oxygen extraction fraction were measured at sequential time-points intraoperatively and up to 6 h postoperatively. Both groups had similar demographic makeup and extent of revascularization (ONCAB 2.6+/-0.9 grafts versus OPCAB 2.5+/-0.8 grafts; P=0.55). The ONCAB group had a mean (+/-SD) CPB time of 62+/-25 min and aortic cross-clamp time of 32+/-11 min. Despite superior global oxygen flux associated with beating-heart revascularization, gastric mucosal hypoxia occurred to similar extents in both groups with worsening trends for the OPCAB patients postoperatively.</s><s>We compared profiles of the numbers of circulating endothelial cells (CEC) and the apoptosis-inducing capacity of serum samples on human endothelial cells (hEC) in on-pump and off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) patients. The apoptosis-inducing activity of serum samples on hEC was examined by a tissue culture assay system. CEC numbers and proportions of apoptotic hEC were significantly elevated during and after surgery in both groups (p<0.01). Compared with the on-pump group, CEC and proportions of apoptotic hEC were significantly lower (p=0.04 and p=0.03, respectively) in patients having CABG performed off-pump. In both groups, CEC numbers and proportions of endothelial apoptosis were still elevated at 48 h after surgery. The number of circulating endothelial cells and apoptotic endothelial cell death are markers of endothelial activation and damage during CABG.</s><s>Uncertainty persists regarding the impact of the off-pump technique on coronary bypass graft patency. Secondary objectives were clinical outcomes and neuropsychological functioning. Graft patency was assessed by multidetector computed tomography 5 weeks after surgery. The two groups were similar regarding patients' characteristics and logistic Euroscore (3.6 vs. 3.7%). Nineteen (27%) off-pump and 9 (13%) on-pump patients had at least one occluded graft (P = 0.04) and the proportion of patent grafts per patient was 0.91 ± 0.2 in off-pump vs. 0.96 ± 0.1 in on-pump (P = 0.06). At 30 days, there was no statistically significant difference in major adverse events and neuropsychological functioning between off-pump and on-pump groups. One-year follow-up showed similar functional class and positive treadmill exercise tests. Thirty-day complications, neuropsychological functioning, and one-year clinical and functional outcomes were not statistically different between the two techniques.</s><s>In order to evaluate the traumatic effects of median sternotomy and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in conventional and minimally invasive coronary artery bypass grafting, inflammatory response was studied in a prospective randomized trial in patients referred to single-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting. Four surgical techniques were compared: group 1, median sternotomy with CPB in ten patients (eight male, two female; aged 59.6+/-11.0 years (mean+/-SD)); group 2, median sternotomy and off-pump in ten patients (seven male, three female; aged 65.1+/-10.0 years); group 3, minithoracotomy with CPB in ten patients (seven male, three female, aged 61.2+/-10.4 years); group 4, minithoracotomy and off-pump in ten patients (nine male, one female, aged 62.9+/-9.8 years). All patients received a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending artery (LAD). Clinical data, perioperative values of cytokines and cardiac enzymes were monitored. The use of CPB is combined with higher levels of troponin-T and CK-MB as signs of myocardial damage. Surgical access was identified as a trigger of inflammatory response, as minithoracotomy is related to higher levels of IL-6.</s><s>Increased Troponin I levels and pro-inflammatory cytokines have been reported in most patients undergoing cardiac surgery, ascribed to the type and extent of surgery, reperfusion injury, and the method of myocardial protection. One hundred twenty patients were prospectively randomized to undergo OPCAB (n = 60) or CCAB (n = 60). Demographic, hemodynamic, and respiratory parameters were similar between the two groups. High levels of these factors could correlate with myocardial damage during coronary artery bypass surgery. This finding warrants further laboratory and clinical confirmation in the future.</s><s>Preliminary reports have documented the safety of off-pump coronary artery bypass graft compared with conventional coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Whereas off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery may be associated with improvement in some short-term outcomes, longer-term outcomes and influence on neurocognitive function have not been fully assessed. Neurocognitive deficit was defined as a 20% or greater reduction from baseline in at least 20% of the tests. Risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated based on intention-to-treat analysis. There was no significant difference in mortality or morbidity between the two groups. The off-pump coronary artery bypass graft group had fewer patients with troponin release than the conventional coronary artery bypass graft group. Off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery did not result in decreased frequency of neurocognitive deficit.</s><s>Despite the accepted utility of delayed-enhancement MRI in identifying irreversible myocardial injury, no study has yet assessed its role as a viability tool exclusively in the setting of coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG), and no study has repeated delayed-enhancement MRI late after revascularization. In a clinical trial in which patients underwent CABG by either the off-pump or on-pump surgical technique, we hypothesized that (1) preoperative delayed-enhancement MRI would have high diagnostic accuracy in predicting viability and (2) the occurrence of perioperative myocardial necrosis would affect late regional wall motion recovery. Fifty-two patients undergoing multivessel CABG were studied by preoperative and early (day 6) and late (6 months) postoperative cine MRI for global and regional functional assessment and delayed-enhancement MRI for assessment of irreversible myocardial injury. Preoperatively, 611 segments (21%) had abnormal regional function, whereas 421 segments (14%) showed evidence of hyperenhancement. Delayed-enhancement MRI is a powerful predictor of myocardial viability after surgery, suggesting an important role for this technique in clinical viability assessment.</s><s>To study the inflammatory reaction and myocardial metabolism in off-pump and on-pump coronary artery bypass patients. Fifty coronary artery bypass patients were randomized to off-pump or on-pump operations. s-ox-Prot 10 min was 2.11 +/- 0.75 vs 2.69 +/- 0.60 (p = 0.014), s-TRAP 5 min was 861 +/- 180 vs 969 +/- 192 (p = 0.032) and s-TRAP 10 min 857 +/- 176 vs 985 +/- 166 (p = 0.011), GSH 10 min 0.55 +/- 0.19 vs 0.72 +/- 1.16 (p = 0.007) (off-pump vs on-pump). GSH levels from the biopsies were increased in the perfusion group early in the reperfusion time showing that myocardial tissue was well protected and recovered more rapidly after cross-clamping than after the occlusion of the coronary arteries.</s><s>The objective of this study was to compare neuropsychologic and quality-of-life outcomes of patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery to those undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery using conventional cardiopulmonary bypass. Sixty-six patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery and a control group of 50 participants not undergoing cardiac surgery. Patients were randomized to receive coronary artery bypass graft surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass or randomized to coronary artery bypass graft surgery without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass.</s><s>Conventional on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is associated with a systemic inflammatory response and by an increased production of reactive oxygen species, whereas off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB) is thought to be accompanied by less oxidative stress. Urinary isoprostane iPF2alpha-III is a new marker reflecting oxidative stress; it has emerged as the most reliable marker of oxidative stress status in vivo. As expected, in CABG iPF2alpha-III levels significantly increased during surgery and returned at baseline 24 hours later. Free malondialdehyde behaved similarly, with no change in OPCAB and sharp increases during CABG.</s><s>Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major postoperative complication following cardiac surgery. Diabetes mellitus is a major cause of nephropathy and end-stage renal failure. We aimed to evaluate the occurrence of adverse renal outcomes, in diabetic patients, between on-pump (CPB) and off-pump (OPCAB) coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). No significant differences in plasmatic creatinine, urinary creatinine, creatinine clearance, proteinuria or osmolality were detected. A significant rise in urinary albumine excretion occurred in both groups peaking on the operative day; for the on-pump CABG group (10±5 vs. 48±57; P=0.015) and for the OPCAB group (11±6 vs. 37±59; P=0.04).</s><s>The activation of the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems and platelet function in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery on-pump or off-pump techniques was compared. Thirty-two patients were randomly assigned to on-pump or off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting. Activation of the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems was evaluated by measurement of several markers. Blood samples were collected at 7 different times, up to postoperative day 6. Thrombin formation was more elevated in the on-pump group (P < .001), particularly during the operation; prothrombin fragment 1.2 discharge values were higher than the preoperative ones (P = .002). Although the extrinsic coagulation pathway is similarly activated, thrombin formation is more pronounced in patients having on-pump bypass grafting. Patients subjected to off-pump bypass grafting have normally functioning platelets and a weak activation of the fibrinolytic system.</s><s>To compare the clinical, angiographic, neurocognitive, and quality of life outcomes of off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery with conventional coronary artery bypass grafting surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass. Neurocognitive tests were carried out at baseline and at six weeks and six months postoperatively. Clinical outcome, graft patency at three months, neurocognitive function at six weeks and six months, and health related quality of life. Graft patency was evaluated by angiography in 151 (89.9%) patients and was similar between the cardiopulmonary bypass and off-pump groups (risk difference - 1%, 95% confidence interval - 5% to 4%), with the off-pump group considered the treatment group. Patients who underwent off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery showed similar patency of grafts, better clinical outcome, shorter hospital stay, and better neurocognitive function than patients who underwent conventional coronary artery bypass grafting surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass.</s><s>In order to investigate the neuroprotective efficacy of off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery (OPCAB) over conventional on-pump coronary artery bypass surgery (CCAB), we have performed a prospective randomized study evaluating retinal circulation changes after OPCAB and CCAB. Retinal fluorescein angiography and 60 degrees black-and-white as well as color fundus photographs of both eyes of each patient were taken 1 to 24 h before and 5 to 6 days after the operation. Neither stroke nor transient ischemic attack occurred postoperatively in these patients. The risk of retinal embolism can be minimized by the use of OPCAB and, most likely, by adequate epiaortic ultrasound scanning of the ascending aorta and avoiding clamping in case of severely diseased aorta.</s><s>Changes in hemostasis after off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting are still being discussed. Aspirin efficacy was assessed by using arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation. Blood samples were collected before the operation, immediately postoperatively, and on days 1, 2, 5, and 30. On day 30, P-selectin expression was similar both between the groups and in comparison with the preoperative values. The platelet activity is higher in the early postoperative period in off-pump compared with on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting. The present aspirin strategy seems to be insufficient in the early postoperative period, irrespective of the surgical technique used.</s><s>The cellular condition of atrial myocytes might play a part in the postoperative development of atrial fibrillation. Our study aimed to investigate whether patients in whom postoperative atrial fibrillation develops show pre-existent alterations in histopathology of the right atrium and how such changes are expressed in relation to the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. Samples from the right atrial appendage were immediately collected after opening the pericardium. In the on-pump group samples were also taken after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass. Focusing on degenerative alterations, histology was studied by means of light microscopy and for confirmation of particular findings by means of electronic microscopy. Twenty-two (31%) patients had postoperative atrial fibrillation, with the rate not being different between the off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting and conventional coronary artery bypass grafting groups (P = .797). Interstitial fibrosis, vacuolization, and nuclear derangement of myocytes were the histologic abnormalities associated with the development of postoperative atrial fibrillation. Cardiopulmonary bypass did not cause additional changes in tested histology variables.</s><s>Right ventricular dysfunction is a possible cause of cardiac failure after coronary surgery. Right ventricular function was assessed by intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography immediately before and after coronary surgery. Peak systolic and early diastolic velocities of the lateral tricuspid annulus were studied to assess systolic and diastolic function in the area of the right ventricular free wall. At the end of surgery, global systolic right ventricular function was similarly maintained and diastolic function similarly impaired in both groups. There were no significant intergroup differences in any of the echocardiographic markers of right ventricular function.</s><s>The feasibility of complete revascularization on the beating heart without cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) as compared with the standard operation with CPB in elective low-risk patients with multivessel disease has not been clearly demonstrated in a prospective trial. Patients were randomly assigned to receive CABG either with (n = 40) or without CPB (n = 40). Randomization criteria were age, sex, and left ventricular ejection fraction. In 5 of these patients (12.5%) suitable vessels were discarded for technical reasons and 9 patients (22.5%) were switched to CABG with CPB owing to the deeply intramyocardial course of target vessels (n = 5) or to hemodynamic instability (n = 4). Three patients undergoing CABG without CPB underwent successful PTCA 3 months after surgery. Nevertheless, it has to be stated that the rate of incomplete revascularization in this early series of CABG without CPB is higher, and compromises the basic principle of complete revascularization.</s><s>In coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) without cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) the inflammatory response is suggested to be minimized. Inflammatory response and myocardial ischaemia need to be studied in a randomized study comparing CABG in multivessel disease with versus without CPB. Immediately postoperatively IL-10 levels were higher in the operated group with CPB (211.7+/-181.9 ng/ml) than in operated patients without CPB (104.6+/-40.3 ng/ml, P=0.0017). A similar pattern of release was observed in serial measures of ICAM-1 and P-selectin, with no difference between both study groups (n.s.). 5 microg/l) than in operated patients with CPB (4469.8+/-4525.7 microg/l, P=0.0152). Troponin I release was 300.7+/-470.5 microg/l (48 h postoperatively) in patients without CPB and 552.9+/-527.8 microg/l (P=0.0213).</s><s>Adverse effects on the respiratory system can be severe in many instances after coronarv artery bypass grafting (CABG) with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPBP). Recently, operative techniques without CPBP have gained widespread consent, thanks to the newly developed retractors that allow satisfactory immobilisation of the surgical field. The length of the operation in group A was less than in group B (196+/-35 minutes vs 235+/-60 minutes), (p=0.014). The length of stay in ICU was significantly different: 33.8+/-16.2 hours for group A vs 53.6+/-29.3 hours for group B (p=0.01).</s><s>Prior studies showed that postoperative increase in plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) levels is associated with an increased risk of graft occlusion after coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). Forty-four patients admitted for elective CABG were randomised to on-pump (n=22) or off-pump (n=22) surgery. Serum samples were collected for estimation of PAI-1 and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) antigen levels preoperatively and 2 h after the operation. After operation, statistical analysis revealed that increase of PAI-1 values was higher in off-pump group (44.1+/-9.1 vs. 25.3+/-6.9) than on-pump group (37.2+/-5.5 vs. 27.3+/-7.8, p=0.002). This study shows that increase in PAI-1 antigen values in patients who undergo off-pump (beating heart) CABG is significantly higher than in those who undergo conventional CABG with cardiopulmonary bypass.</s><s>The aim of the study was to compare energetic metabolism in the myocardium during coronary surgery with and without cardiopulmonary bypass by means of microdialysis. Microdialysis was used to sample myocardial interstitial fluid during and for 23 hours after surgery. Preoperative characteristics and clinical outcome were similar in both groups. During surgery, intramyocardial levels of glucose, pyruvate and urea were unaffected in off-pump patients, while the same substances significantly decreased (p<0.05) in on-pump patients during cardioplegic arrest, and increased during reperfusion. Microdialysis could demonstrate significant differences in energetic metabolism between the two groups.</s><s>Off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB) is associated with a less intense systemic inflammatory response according to biochemical markers. One hundred consecutive patients were randomized to OPCAB or ONCAB, 50 in each group. Temperature, SVR index, cardiac index, and blood pressure were measured continuously for the first 24 hours postoperatively. Mean temperature peaked at 37.5 degrees C at 12 hours (p = 0.700 between groups). The incidence of high SVR (>2,500 dyne x cm(-5) x m(-2)) fell from 20% to 2% by 12 to 18 hours. The incidence of low SVR, and patterns of SVR changes were similar in ONCAB and OPCAB, and were clinically unimportant as few patients required vasopressor support.</s><s>The clinical benefit of off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery over on-pump surgery is a matter of controversy. The questionnaire yields eight subscores of functional health and well being. The eight SF-36 raw scores were standardized using means and standard deviations from a random sample of adults in Great Britain. Questionnaires were completed for 72% (154 of 212) and 46% (98 of 212) of patients at the 6- and 18-month follow-up, respectively. Fifty-six (72%) on-pump and 59 (75%) off-pump patients reported a better health status compared with the 6-month period before surgery (not significant). Patients who have undergone off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery have a similar quality of life to on-pump patients at 6 and 18 months after surgery.</s><s>We aimed to evaluate the clinical results and biocompatibility of the minimal extracorporeal circulation system (MECC) compared with off-pump coronary revascularization (OPCABG). End points were (1) circulating markers of inflammation and organ injury, (2) operative results, and (3) outcome at 1-year follow-up. Length of hospital stay and use of blood products were similar between groups. Two cases of angina recurrence at 1 year in the MECC group were observed versus 5 cases observed in the OPCABG group (P=0.44). Six (OPCABG group) versus 3 (MECC group) coronary grafts were occluded or severely stenotic at 1 year (P=0.33, odds ratio 0.47, 95% confidence interval 0.09 to 2.14). Clinical results of coronary revascularization with MECC are optimal when this procedure is performed by experienced teams.</s><s>To evaluate hospital mortality and morbidity after myocardial revascularization in a prospective and multicenter study, comparing on-pump versus off-pump in a special subset of patients with lesions in the left descending artery, alone or associated with the right coronary artery. One hundred and five were male and ages ranged from 39 to 70 years old; mean 58.81 +/- 9.31 and median 59. Hospital mortality was 2.5%, three patients (3.7%) in group I (on-pump) and one patient (1.2%) in group II (off-pump) (ns). Six patients (7.5%) had myocardial infarction in group I and three (3.7%) in group II (ns). Bleeding in the postoperative period was 680.50 +/- 434.1 mL in the on-pump group and 678.6 +/- 357.0 mL in the off-pump group (ns). We did not find any statistical difference in hospital mortality and morbidity using on-pump or off-pump techniques for low-risk patients.</s><s>Cardiac surgery initiates a systemic inflammatory response, which may affect endothelial function. Fifty-two patients submitted for elective CABG were included in a prospective, randomized study. Twenty-six patients were operated with, and 26 without cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Plasma levels of complement (C3a), cytokines (IL-8, TNF-alpha), endothelin-1 and neopterin were measured before and during surgery and 2 and 24 h after surgery.</s><s>Studies have reported lower levels in off-pump coronary artery surgery (CABG) compared to on-pump surgery. However, most of these are flawed as S100 from extracerebral sources was included (e.g. Microemboli (high-intensity transient signals or HITS) during CABG have been implicated as a cause of postoperative neurocognitive dysfunction. Thirty-five patients admitted for CABG were randomised to on-pump (n=20) or off-pump (n=15) surgery. The number of HITS was 2016+/-1897 during on-pump and 16+/-21 during off-pump surgery (P<0.0001). In off-pump surgery S100 increased from 0.08+/-0.05 to 0.35+/-0.20 microg/l (P<0.0001) at completion of anastomoses. There was no evidence of a relationship between S100 and HITS in both groups. We have demonstrated a significantly higher number of cerebral microemboli in patients undergoing on-pump compared to off-pump CABG. By limiting contamination from extracerebral sources, we have shown S100 beta levels during on-pump CABG one and a half times greater than that in off-pump, although this did not reach statistical significance.</s><s>The aim of this prospective study was to determine whether the inflammation-associated clinical morbidity as well as the subclinical markers of the inflammatory response are reduced in patients who undergo minimally invasive coronary artery bypass grafting without cardiopulmonary bypass. In the group that underwent minimally invasive coronary artery bypass grafting, leukocyte elastase, platelet beta-thromboglobulin, and complement C3a were unchanged at the end of the procedure compared with their baseline concentrations, whereas these inflammatory markers were increased significantly in the group that underwent conventional coronary artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass. The patients who underwent minimally invasive coronary artery bypass grafting had a shorter duration of operation (104 +/- 28 versus 140 +/- 28 minutes; p < 0.01), less blood loss (312 +/- 167 versus 788 +/- 365 mL; p < 0.01), shorter ventilatory support (7.7 +/- 4.1 versus 12.9 +/- 3.4 hours; p < 0.01), and a shorter postoperative hospital stay (4.4 +/- 1.7 versus 7.7 +/- 2.6 days; p < 0.01) than the patients who underwent the conventional procedure.</s><s>Preoperative renal insufficiency is a predictor of acute renal failure in patients undergoing coronary artery revascularization with cardiopulmonary bypass. Off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting has been shown to be less deleterious than on-pump bypass in patients with normal renal function, but the effect of this technique in patients with non-dialysis dependent renal insufficiency in a randomized study is unknown. MDRD GFR and serum creatinine levels were measured preoperatively and postoperatively at days 1 and 5. The changes in renal function and clinical outcomes were compared between the two groups. Three patents required hemodialysis in the on-pump group and none in the off-pump group. MDRD GFR is a more sensitive investigation than serum creatinine levels to assess renal insufficiency in patients undergoing coronary bypass.</s><s>We investigated the efficacy of coronary surgery with or without cardiopulmonary bypass in protecting the function of the small intestine, liver, and pancreas. Patients were randomized to off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB) or coronary artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass (CABG-CPB). Monoethylglycinexylidide/lidocaine ratios were not different in the two groups. Aspartate transaminase and alanine-amino transferase levels were higher in the CABG-CPB group for the first postoperative day, but levels converged by day 3 (interaction of surgery type and time; p < 0.0001 and p = 0.04, respectively). Amylase levels were higher in the CABG-CPB group than in the OPCAB group (1.17 times; p = 0.03); other markers of pancreatic function showed no differences between the groups. Early small intestine function is worse with OPCAB; all functions recover to similar levels in both groups by day 5. Conversely, pancreatic function is worse with the CABG-CPB group than with the OPCAB group.</s><s>Coronary artery bypass graft surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass is a safe, routine procedure. Nevertheless, significant morbidity remains, mostly because of the body's response to the nonphysiological nature of cardiopulmonary bypass. In a single-center randomized trial, 308 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery were randomly assigned: 155 to OPCAB and 153 to on-pump CAB (ONCAB). Primary composite end points were death, myocardial infarction, further revascularization (surgery or angioplasty), or stroke. After 5-year follow-up, the primary composite end point was not different between groups (hazard ratio 0.71, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.22; P=0.21). No difference was found between groups in the primary composite end point at 5-years follow-up.</s><s>Previous trials of off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) have enrolled selected patients and have not rigorously evaluated long-term graft patency. A preliminary report showed OPCAB achieved improved inhospital outcomes, similar completeness of revascularization, and shorter lengths of stay compared with conventional coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). A total of 200 patients were enrolled; 3 patients were withdrawn after randomization for mitral valve repair or replacement. One surgical session consisting of elective OPCAB or CABG with cardiopulmonary bypass. The surgeon had extensive experience performing off-pump surgery; patients were subsequently managed by blinded protocols. Coronary angiography documented graft patency prior to hospital discharge and at 1 year; health-related quality of life; and cost of the index and subsequent hospitalization(s). Graft patency was similar for OPCAB and conventional CABG with cardiopulmonary bypass at 30 days (absolute difference, 1.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.66% to 3.31%; P =.19) and at 1 year (absolute difference, -2.2%; 95% CI, -6.1% to 1.7%; P =.27). OPCAB may provide complete revascularization that is durable and cost-effective.</s><s>Cardiopulmonary bypass seems to be a major cause for both intraoperative microemboli and cerebral hypoperfusion. The results are related to the neuropsychologic outcome in both surgical groups. The median value of HITS was 394.5 (0 to 2217) in the conventional versus 11 (0 to 50) in the off-pump group, p less than 0.0001. Postoperative cognitive testing showed significantly different results with a postoperative impairment of 90% of the patients in the conventional group versus no impairment in the off-pump group. The off-pump technique appears to be promising in order to eliminate the source of these neuropyschologic impairments following CABG operation.</s><s>Off-pump coronary bypass surgery has become a widely used technique during recent years. However, limited data are available with regard to 1-year patency of bypass grafts implanted on the beating heart in unselected consecutive bypass surgery candidates. Saphenous graft patency per patient was lower in the off-pump group: 0.7 patent anastomosis per patient versus 1.1 patent anastomosis in the on-pump group (P<0.01). There were 46% on-pump patients with all grafts patent versus 52% off-pump patients (P=NS).</s><s>Cardiopulmonary bypass has been implicated in causing poor pulmonary gas exchange postoperatively in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting procedures. This randomized prospective study was conducted to determine whether patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting operations using cardiac stabilization and thereby avoiding cardiopulmonary bypass will have improved pulmonary function postoperatively. Fifty-eight patients were randomized to one of two groups: coronary artery bypass grafting operation with stabilization or coronary artery bypass grafting operation with cardiopulmonary bypass. Both study groups had a large decrease in arterial partial pressure of oxygen on 100% inspired oxygen (p < 0.0001) and a significant postoperative increase in the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (p < 0.0001). The mean static and dynamic lung compliance postoperatively was lower in the stabilization group, although not statistically significant (p = 0.06). Coronary artery bypass grafting operation using cardiac stabilization technique is safe and avoids the risk of cardiopulmonary bypass.</s><s>There is increased interest in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) without cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), although the preservation of the myocardium under such circumstances has not been properly investigated. Myocardial energy metabolism and tissue injury during CABG was monitored in a series of 22 patients (11 with and 11 without CPB). The maximum myocardial lactate production was significantly higher (p = 0.02) in the group operated with CPB (0.56 mmol/L) than without it (0.17 mmol/L).</s><s>It has been previously shown that a persistent (up to 1 month) prothrombotic status occurs after coronary bypass surgery performed both on pump and off pump. Blood samples were collected before the intervention, after protamine administration, and 4, 8, and 30 days after surgical intervention. Plasma tissue factor levels were significantly higher than baseline both in the on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting group (from protamine administration up to 4 postoperative days) and in the off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting group (at 4 postoperative days), with no differences between groups. Basal and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated monocyte tissue factor expression, as well as basal and adenosine diphosphate-stimulated platelet tissue factor expression, did not show significant variations over time and were similar in the on-pump and off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting groups throughout the course of the study. The postoperative tissue factor and P-selectin expression did not differ between the on-pump and off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting groups.</s><s>The aim of this study was to monitor and compare the changes in metabolism and blood flow in the skeletal muscles during cardiac operations performed with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and operations without CPB (off-pump) by means of interstitial microdialysis (Figure 1). Twenty patients (On-Pump Group) were operated on using CPB, 20 patients (Off-Pump Group) were operated on without CPB. There was no significant difference in dialysate concentrations of glucose and lactate between the groups. In the Off-Pump Group, pyruvate concentrations were higher and the values of concentrations of glycerol lower. There was no significant difference in dialysate concentrations of ethanol as a flow-marker during the surgery in either of the groups. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups (On-Pump Group vs. Off-Pump Group) comparing the postoperative clinical outcome (ICU stay, ventilation duration, length of hospital stay). The dynamic changes in the interstitial concentrations of the glucose, glycerol, pyruvate and lactate were found in both the groups of patients (On-Pump Group and Off-Pump Group), but there was no difference in local blood flow when the ethanol dilution technique was used. Results suggest that extracorporeal circulation, cardiopulmonary bypass, compromises peripheral tissue (skeletal muscles) energy metabolism. These changes have no impact on the postoperative clinical outcome; no significant difference between the groups was found.</s><s>To compare the safety and efficacy of coronary artery bypass grafting without using extracorporeal circulation with standard cardiopulmonary bypass technique, based on certain early postoperative criteria, we designed a fully randomized and prospective study on two similar groups of 25 patients (off-pump and on-pump groups). The groups were compared for hemodynamic data (cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance, left- and right-ventricular stroke-work indices, inotropic and mechanical support needs) and enzyme levels (CK-MB and SGOT), as well as mortality, perioperative infarction rate, homologous transfusion requirements, and the symptomatology in the first follow-ups. There was no mortality or perioperative myocardial infarction in either group. With these properties, this technique could take an important place in the cardiac surgeon's armamentarium.</s><s>After more than a decade of experience with off-pump coronary bypass surgery, still no consensus exists concerning its benefit on clinical outcome compared to the on-pump technique. In this 12-month follow-up, we compare off-pump and on-pump surgery on the appearance of graft patency, myocardial function, and clinical outcome. There were no differences in exercise capacity improvement and attenuation of symptoms between the groups. At 12-months follow-up, off-pump coronary bypass surgery provided the same angiographic graft patency as the on-pump technique. Improvement in functional class and exercise capacity was the same in both groups.</s><s>Coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG) has traditionally been performed with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (on-pump CABG). CABG without cardiopulmonary bypass (off-pump CABG) might reduce the number of complications related to the heart-lung machine. We randomly assigned 2203 patients scheduled for urgent or elective CABG to either on-pump or off-pump procedures. The primary short-term end point was a composite of death or complications (reoperation, new mechanical support, cardiac arrest, coma, stroke, or renal failure) before discharge or within 30 days after surgery. The rate of the 1-year composite outcome was higher for off-pump than for on-pump CABG (9.9% vs. 7.4%, P=0.04). There were no treatment-based differences in neuropsychological outcomes or short-term use of major resources. No significant differences between the techniques were found in neuropsychological outcomes or use of major resources.</s><s>We sought to compare the effects on ophthalmic function of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and off-pump (OPCAB) grafting and to investigate whether retinal microvascular damage is associated with markers of cerebral injury. Retinal microvascular damage was assessed by fluorescein angiography and color fundus photography. Ophthalmic function was tested by the logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution visual acuity (VA), and cerebral injury, by transcranial Doppler ultrasound-detected emboli and S100 protein values. Retinal microvascular damage was detected in 5 of 9 CABG-CPB but in none of 10 OPCAB patients (risk difference, 55%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 23% to 88%; P=0.01). HITS were 14.7 times more frequent (95% CI, 3.5 to 62; P=0.001) and S100 level 2.1 times higher (95% CI, 1.3 to 3.5; P=0.005) when retinal microvascular damage was present.</s><s>This study sought to assess inflammation activation in the follow-up (up to one month) of coronary bypass surgery performed both on- (CABG) and off-pump (OPCAB). Thirty patients, candidates for coronary surgery, were randomized to undergo CABG (n = 16) or OPCAB (n = 14). Blood samples were collected before the intervention, after protamine administration, and 4, 8, and 30 days after surgery. Plasma tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels significantly increased with respect to baseline from protamine administration up to eight postoperative days, whereas high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and fibrinogen increased after surgery up to eight postoperative days in both groups.</s><s>Neurologic and clinical morbidity after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) can be significant. Neurocognitive testing was performed before the operation and 2 weeks and 1 year after the operation. Coronary artery bypass grafting was associated with more cerebral microemboli (575 +/- 278.5 CABG versus 16.0 +/- 19.5 OPCAB (median +/- semiinterquartile range) and significantly reduced cerebral perfusion after the operation to the bilateral occipital, cerebellar, precunei, thalami, and left temporal lobes (p < or = 0.01). These differences culminated in higher costs for CABG ($23,053 +/- $5,320 CABG versus $17,780 +/- $4,390 OPCAB, p < 0.0001). Compared with CABG, OPCAB may reduce neurologic and clinical morbidity as well as cost.</s><s>Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) has been reported to increase oxygen metabolism and to influence the relation between oxygen consumption (VO(2)) and delivery (DO(2)) in the early hours after cardiac surgery. Oxygen metabolism variables were assessed before induction of anesthesia and up to 18-hours after surgery. After surgery VO(2) and ExO(2) increased in both groups, while DO(2) decreased. The relation between VO(2) and DO(2) was very similar in CABG and OPCAB patients throughout the study, and no significant differences were detected in slopes and intercepts of the regression lines between CABG and OPCAB at all time points. Cardiopulmonary bypass is not responsible for these changes in oxygen metabolism.</s><s>In this study, we test the hypothesis that off-pump coronary bypass surgery might result in less lymphocyte activation than on-pump coronary surgery. We also study the behavior of lymphocyte activation markers during and after surgery. Expression of CD25, CD26, CD69, and DR on T (CD3+) and B (CD19+) lymphocytes on peripheral blood was assessed through flow cytometry. For B lymphocytes, there was early reduction with increase on the 1st postoperative day. There was early activation of CD69+ and late activation of CD25+ on T lymphocytes. For B lymphocytes, there was early activation of CD69+ and late activation of DR+.</s><s>Gastrointestinal complications after cardiac surgery remain a significant problem despite improvements in pre-operative, operative and post-operative care. Significant variables were then included into a stepwise logistic regression model to ascertain their independent influence on the occurrence of gastrointestinal complications. However, stepwise multivariate regression analysis identified CPB inclusive of cardioplegic arrest as the only predictor of post-operative gastrointestinal complications (OR7.4; CI 3.4-17.9). Cardiopulmonary bypass, inclusive of cardioplegic arrest, is the main independent predictor of post-operative gastrointestinal complications in patients undergoing coronary revascularisation.</s><s>Off-pump CABG is potentially associated with reduced intraoperative blood loss and homologous blood transfusion in comparison to on-pump CABG. Homologous blood was transfused when haemoglobin concentration fell below 8 g/dl postoperatively. Pre- and postoperatively prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were measured. Preoperative patient characteristics were well matched among the four groups. Volume of homologous blood transfusion was significantly higher in group B vs groups A, C and D (595+/-438 ml vs 179+/-214, 141+/-183 and 230+/-240 ml, respectively, P<0.005). The cell saver groups (A and C) received significantly less homologous blood than the groups without cell saver (160+/-197 ml vs 413+/-394 ml, respectively, P<0.005). There was no significant difference in postoperative morbidity between groups. Cell saver caused no significant adverse impact on coagulation parameters in on- or off-CPB CABG. We recommend the use of autologous blood transfusion in both on- and off-pump CABG surgery.</s><s>We hypothesized that off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting has less impact on the hemostatic systems than on-pump surgery. Thirty-one patients were randomized to on-pump or off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting. Four hours after admission to the intensive care unit, these differences were eliminated. Protein C1 esterase inhibitor and von Willebrand factor concentrations increased over time (p < 0.001) in both groups. Platelet count decreased on the first postoperative day (p < 0.001), but increased from the first to the third postoperative day (p = 0.004) in both groups without any inter group difference (p = 0.82).</s><s>Conventional coronary artery bypass graft surgery with use of cardiopulmonary bypass (on-pump CABG) is associated with excellent long-term cardiac outcomes but also with a high incidence of cognitive decline. The effect of avoiding cardiopulmonary bypass (off-pump CABG) on long-term cognitive and cardiac outcomes is unknown. The Octopus Study, a multicenter randomized controlled trial conducted in the Netherlands, which enrolled 281 low-risk CABG patients between 1998 and 2000. Five years after their surgery, surviving patients were invited for a follow-up assessment. Secondary measures were occurrence of cardiovascular events (all-cause mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction, and coronary reintervention), anginal status, and quality of life. When using a standard definition of cognitive decline (20% decline in performance in 20% of the neuropsychological test variables), 62 (50.4%) of 123 in the off-pump group and 59 (50.4%) of 117 in the on-pump group had cognitive decline (absolute difference, 0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -12.7% to 12.6%; P>.99).</s>"

The side effects of prophylactic chemotherapy were stomatitis, nausea/vomiting, sore throat with oral ulcer and hair loss. One course of actinomycin D given as chemoprophylaxis decreased by 72.4% malignant sequelae after evacuation of molar tissue in patients with high-risk CHM.</s><s>Seventy-one patients with complete hydatidiform mole were prospectively randomized into two groups: one group (39 patients) was treated with a single course of methotrexate and citrovorum factor rescue as chemoprophylaxis; the other group (32 patients) was not treated. The time interval from evacuation of the mole to diagnosis of persistent trophoblastic disease was longer in the treated group than in the untreated group (9.5 +/- 2.4 weeks versus 5.1 +/- 1.6 weeks, P less than .05). Among low-risk patients there was no difference between the groups (5.6 versus 7.7%, P greater than .05).

Ophthalmologic and systemic complications were assessed intraoperatively and 1 month after surgery. No statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups.</s><s>Routine preoperative medical testing is commonly performed in patients scheduled to undergo cataract surgery, although the value of such testing is uncertain. We performed a study to determine whether routine testing helps reduce the incidence of intraoperative and postoperative medical complications. Adverse medical events and interventions on the day of surgery and during the seven days after surgery were recorded. Medical outcomes were assessed in 9408 patients who underwent 9626 cataract operations that were not preceded by routine testing and in 9411 patients who underwent 9624 operations that were preceded by routine testing. The overall rate of complications (intraoperative and postoperative events combined) was the same in the two groups (31.3 events per 1000 operations).

A previously completed phase 3 trial, also placebo controlled, in 32 patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma also demonstrated a survival benefit in those patients treated with BCNU wafers. Because of the small number of patients in that trial, a larger phase 3 trial was performed to confirm these results. Median survival in the intent-to-treat group was 13.9 months for the BCNU wafer-treated group and 11.6 months for the placebo-treated group (log-rank P -value stratified by country = 0.03), with a 29% reduction in the risk of death in the treatment group. When adjusted for factors affecting survival, the treatment effect remained positive with a risk reduction of 28% ( P = 0.03).</s><s>Chemotherapy for brain tumours has been limited because of difficulty in achieving adequate exposure to the tumour without systemic toxicity. Implantation of the drug-impregnated polymer at the tumour site allows prolonged local exposure with minimal systemic exposure. We conducted a randomised, placebo-controlled, prospective study to evaluate the effectiveness of biodegradable polymers impregnated with carmustine to treat recurrent malignant gliomas. In 27 medical centres, 222 patients with recurrent malignant brain tumours requiring re-operation were randomly assigned to receive surgically implanted biodegradable polymer discs with or without 3.85% carmustine.

Antibiotic prophylaxis is therefore frequently used in patients having ERCP, but existing data are insufficient to allow evaluation of the effectiveness of this practice. To determine the efficacy of single-dose antibiotic prophylaxis with piperacillin for ERCP-induced cholangitis. Patients who had ERCP for suspected biliary tract stones or distal common bile duct stricture were eligible. Seventeen of the 281 patients who received placebo (6.0%) and 12 of the 270 patients who received piperacillin (4.4%) developed acute cholangitis (relative risk, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.36 to 1.51]). All cases of cholangitis (with the exception of one case seen in a patient in the piperacillin group) were mild or moderate in severity.</s><s>Cholangitis and pancreatitis are severe complications of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Antibiotics have been considered important in preventing cholangitis, especially in those with jaundice. Some have suggested that bacteria may play a role in the induction of post-ERCP pancreatitis. It is not clear, however, whether the incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis could be reduced by antibiotic prophylaxis, as is the case with septic complications. Patients who were allergic to cephalosporins, patients with immune deficiency or any other condition requiring antibiotic prophylaxis, patients with clinical jaundice, and pregnant patients were excluded. Nine patients in the prophylaxis group (6%) and 15 patients in the control group (9%) had remarkably increased serum amylase levels (>900 IU/L) after ERCP, but clinical signs of acute pancreatitis with leukocytosis, CRP reaction, and pain developed in four of nine patients in the prophylaxis group compared to 15 of 15 patients with hyperamylasemia in the control group (P = 0.003). We conclude that antibiotic prophylaxis effectively decreases the risk of pancreatitis, in addition to cholangitis after ERCP, and can thus be routinely recommended prior to ERCP.</s><s>Biliary sepsis represents a major percentage of fatal complications after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. We performed a randomized controlled study to investigate the value of antibiotic prophylaxis, and to assess the frequency and source of infectious complications associated with ERCP. Several lines of evidence suggested that bacteremia associated with ERCP was essentially caused by mucosal lesions of the oropharynx. Bacteremia was asymptomatic, with the exception of two patients who subsequently developed fever, but recovered rapidly under antibiotic therapy. The frequency of cholangitis following ERCP was not significantly reduced by antibiotic prophylaxis (4% vs. 2%).</s><s>Despite the existence of published recommendations, various studies of antibiotic prophylaxis have reached conflicting conclusions, and controversy exists regarding the role of antibiotic prophylaxis in ERCP. Four were obtained post-ERCP (two patients in group I and two in group II) and the remaining three before endoscopy. The post-ERCP isolated bacteria were: Streptococcus mitis, Peptoestreptococcus anaerobious, Moraxella spp and Escherichia coli. Two patients, one from each group, developed post-ERCP cholangitis that were solved with medical treatment. Our findings indicate that ERCP induce bacteremia in a small group of patients and suggest that prophylactic administration of clindamicine plus gentamicine does not reduce the incidence of bacteremia and cholangitis, and do not support the routine use of prophylactic antibiotics prior to ERCP.</s><s>We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of antibiotic prophylaxis before diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in 82 uninfected patients with cholestasis due to biliary tree obstruction of single or multiple causes. The patients were assigned to receive piperacillin (4 g) or placebo three times daily; prophylaxis was started just before initial ERCP and was continued until biliary drainage was completely unobstructed (by one or more ERCP procedures); the maximal duration of prophylaxis was 7 days. The 68 clinically evaluable patients underwent 81 therapeutic ERCP procedures. Complete biliary drainage influenced clinical outcome favorably (odds ratio, 5.0; P = .02). We concluded that antimicrobial prophylaxis significantly reduces the incidence of septic complications after therapeutic ERCP among patients presenting with cholestasis.</s><s>Prophylactic measures for the prevention of complications (pancreatitis, pancreatic and biliary sepsis) after an ERCP examination were investigated in a controlled study. A total of 118 patients were selected at random and divided into three groups by post-ERCP treatment (Group A: no treatment, Group B: oral prophylaxis with broad spectrum tetracycline, Group C: bedrest for 36 hours, fasting, stomach catheter and infusion prophylaxis. In addition to this, prophylactic measures after ERCP had no influence on the frequency, duration and extent of such temporary symptoms as abdominal discomfort, fever, leukocytosis, hyperamylasemia, hyperamylasuria and cholestasis. It is worth considering carrying out ERCP on an out-patient basis in special cases.</s><s>To assess prospectively the effectiveness of a single prophylactic dose of cefuroxim before therapeutic endoscopy, in view of the general practice not to give antibiotics routinely. In a prospective study endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography with drainage (PTCD) together with simultaneous stone extraction, dilatation or stent implantation were performed in 99 patients (51 men, 48 women; mean age 60.6 +/- 19.2 years). Bile cultures were obtained in 56 patients with indwelling biliary drainage. The septicaemia rate was 6.1% in group A and 10% in group B (not significant).

Early diagnosis is important to achieve the best outcome for these patients; however, definite proof often is difficult to obtain due to counterindicated invasive procedures. This study evaluated the specificity and sensitivity of the detection of galactomannan (GM) for the diagnostic and prediction of IA in 347 children from the Pediatric Hematology Service and 450 patients from the Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit at the Hôpital Saint-Louis in Paris. Among the patients studied, 53 presented with confirmed IA (n = 27 patients) or probable IA (n = 26 patients). In patients without IA, 44 of 744 had positive antigenemia, resulting in a specificity of 94%. False positive results could not be related to the presence of a concurrent mucositis. The presence of antigen has a good diagnostic value mainly when there is an increase in the titer on two consecutive sera samples.</s><s>The accepted limitations associated with classic culture techniques for the diagnosis of invasive fungal infections have lead to the emergence of many non-culture-based methods. With superior sensitivities and quicker turnaround times, non-culture-based methods may aid the diagnosis of invasive fungal infections. Despite enhanced sensitivity, the PCR method failed to detect nucleic acid in a probable case of invasive Candida infection that was detected by ELISA. In conclusion, both PCR and ELISA techniques should be used in unison to aid the detection of invasive fungal infections.</s><s>Two noninvasive diagnostic tests, (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan (BG) (Glucatell) and galactomannan (GM) (Platelia Aspergillus), were used retrospectively in a twice-weekly screening for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in 40 treatment episodes (one hospital visit per patient) in 40 neutropenic adult patients at high risk for IA. Five proven IA cases, three probable IA cases, and three possible IA cases were diagnosed. Diagnostic levels of both BG and GM were detected in 100% of patients with proven IA cases and in 66% of patients with probable IA cases. A combination of the two tests improved the specificity (to 100%) and positive predictive value (to 100%) of each individual test without affecting the sensitivity and negative predictive values. In conclusion, BG and GM detection are useful tests for the diagnosis of IA in high-risk hematological patients, but a combination of the two tests was very useful to identify false-positive reactions by each test.</s><s>Screening for Aspergillus antigen and DNA has been introduced for the early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in adults, but data in children at risk are scarce. Seventeen 1-108 month-old children were screened for Aspergillus antigenaemia by a commercial assay before and after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Results of both assays were correlated with clinical, radiological and microbiological findings used for the definition of invasive aspergillosis by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC).

Blood samples were collected twice per week from 128 patients with hematologic diseases during periods of neutropenic fever after undergoing chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. There were 14 patients with IA (2 patients with proven IA and 12 with probable IA). Galactomannan antigenemia (index, >0.5) was detected with a sensitivity of 86%. In receiver-operator characteristic analysis, the cutoff index of NASBA for the presumptive diagnosis of IA was determined to be 5.0.</s><s>The clinical utility of Platelia trade mark Aspergillus galactomannan antigen for the early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis was prospectively assessed in 70 consecutive lung transplant recipients. Using the generalized estimating equation model, at the cutoff value of >or= 0.5, the sensitivity of the test was 30%, specificity 93% with positive and negative likelihood ratios of 4.2 and 0.75, respectively. Thus, the test demonstrated excellent specificity, but a low sensitivity for the diagnosis of aspergillosis in this patient population. Patients with cystic fibrosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may transiently have a positive test in the early post-transplant period.</s><s>We report the occurrence of a high rate of false-positive test results during the surveillance of hematology patients for galactomannan (GM) antigenemia. Among 218 patients surveyed from June 2002 through June 2003, 42 (19.3%) had > or =1 serum sample positive for GM (optical density index, >1.5). Case-control analysis showed that treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam was the only risk factor significantly associated with receiving false-positive test results. When tested for GM antigen, 3 of 4 piperacillin-tazobactam batches had positive results.</s><s>Aspergillus antigenemia was followed up in 215 consecutively observed bone marrow transplant (BMT) patients over a period of two years, using both a latex agglutination test and a sandwich immunocapture enzyme immunoassay (EIA) with a rat antigalactomannan monoclonal antibody as capture and detector antibody. For each patient, sequential sera (3 to 20) were obtained before and after BMT. In 19 of 25 patients with confirmed aspergillosis and 9 of 15 patients with probable aspergillosis, the EIA was more sensitive and detected infection earlier than the latex test. In all positive cases, antigenemia rapidly increased in sequential samples and remained strongly positive. The overall positive and negative predictive values for the EIA were 54% and 95% respectively.</s><s>The usefulness of galactomannan detection using the Platelia Aspergillus test for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis was studied in 849 sera from 54 hematological patients with prolonged neutropenia, which were classified according to the risk for invasive aspergillosis. Three patients developed a proven invasive aspergillosis, one a probable invasive aspergillosis and 17 patients a possible invasive aspergillosis. A rise in the concentration of galactomannan was observed in patients who failed to respond to the antifungal treatment. Galactomannan antigenemia preceded post-mortem histological diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in two patients by 17 and 81 days, respectively. In conclusion, detection of galactomannan by the Platelia Aspergillus test allows for a specific and relatively sensitive diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in hematological patients with a high and intermediate risk for invasive aspergillosis.</s><s>Early diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is important as prompt treatment with antifungal drugs may increase patient survival. From February 2002 to June 2004, 74 hemato-oncologic patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation were prospectively studied with serum AGA twice weekly from admission until death or discharge and weekly afterward when possible. Seven patients were classified with possible IPA and two patients, proven IPA. The sensitivity and specificity of the test were 100% and 93%, respectively; the positive and negative predictive values were 64% and 100%, respectively. The combination of AGA detection and early chest CT scans might be considered useful tools to detect minimal changes of IPA.</s><s>The double sandwich ELISA detecting Aspergillus galactomannan (GM) was prospectively evaluated for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in 50 haematological patients at risk for IA. Serum samples were collected once weekly as long as the risk factors persisted. Unfortunately, positive GM titres did not anticipate the initiation of antifungal therapy, based on clinical suspicion. Moreover, if a true-positive result was defined as two consecutive positive serum samples, four patients out of 35 without proven, probable or suspected IA were positive. Nevertheless, the GM ELISA appears useful to assess IA and to follow the efficacy of antifungal treatment.</s><s>Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a frequent complication of blood or marrow transplantation. We examined the performance of the GM EIA in 986 serum samples from 67 patients. The low cutoff increased the duration of test positivity before diagnosis by clinical means. A quantifiable response to antifungal therapy in clinical samples and the rabbit model supports the development of this assay for early diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring.</s><s>Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a considerable clinical problem in neutropenic patients with haematological malignancies but its diagnosis remains difficult. Patient episodes were stratified according to the 2002 European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycosis Study Group consensus criteria and the PCR and serology results were correlated with the clinical diagnostic classification. Sensitivity and specificity rates for the nested-PCR assay were up to 63.6% [95% confidence interval (CI): 30.8-89%) and 63.5% (95% CI: 53.4-72.7%) respectively, and 33.3% and 98.9% (95% CI: 7.5-70.1% and 94.2-99.9%) for GM respectively. The LightCycler PCR assay yielded positive results in 21.4%, lacking discrimination by quantification across the different clinical categories. In patients at high risk for IA, positive results for Aspergillus by PCR of blood samples are highly suggestive for IA and contribute to the diagnosis.</s><s>The performance of two Aspergillus antigenemia systems, the sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Platelia Aspergillus test, and the latex agglutination (LA), Pastorex Aspergillus test, in the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis were compared by testing 364 serum samples from 22 bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients. Sensitivity and specificity for the ELISA test were 60% and 82% respectively, vs 40% and 94% for the LA test.</s><s>We determined the value of galactomannan (GM) detection in computerized tomography (CT)-based broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and serum for the diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) in haemato-oncological patients with neutropenia. CT of the thorax and BAL were performed systematically at predefined clinical indications. In this study, 22 of 198 patients (11.1%) presented with IPA, and the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of GM detection in CT-based BAL fluid were 85%, 100%, 100% and 88% respectively. None of BAL fluids obtained after antifungal treatment of 3 d or more were positive.</s><s>To improve the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA), we retrospectively compared competitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sandwich ELISA for detection of serum galactomannan (GM) antigen. Twenty-two patients had confirmed, probable, or suspected IA, according to clinical and mycologic data. Of the 19 patients without IA (83 samples), one had 3 GM-false-positive samples. This study suggests that PCR on serum samples is not more sensitive than GM detection.</s><s>We compared an Aspergillus fumigatus-specific Taqman real-time PCR assay for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay Platelia Aspergillus method. The PCR method seems to be more specific, and a combination of the two should improve the diagnosis of IA.</s><s>Serum galactomannan detection is considered to be a useful test for early diagnosis and follow-up of invasive aspergillosis. Eleven patients (11%) having a positive result (OD index >1.5 ng/ml) in two consecutive Platelia Aspergillus tests were considered galactomannan-positive cases. On the other hand, 12 patients (12%) were diagnosed of proven or probable invasive aspergillosis. Moreover, kinetics of antigenemia could be useful for assessing therapeutic response.</s><s>Poor performance of galactomannan and mannan sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays in the diagnosis of invasive fungal infection.</s><s>The establishment of an optimal noninvasive method for diagnosing invasive aspergillosis (IA) is needed to improve the management of this life-threatening infection in patients with hematological disorders, and a number of noninvasive tests for IA that target different fungal components, including galactomannan, (1-->3)-beta-d-glucan (BDG), and Aspergillus DNA, have been developed. In this study, we prospectively evaluated the diagnostic potential of three noninvasive tests for IA that were used in a weekly screening strategy: the double-sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for galactomannan (Platelia Aspergillus), a real-time PCR assay for Aspergillus DNA (GeniQ-Asper), and an assay for BDG (beta-glucan Wako). We analyzed 149 consecutive treatment episodes in 96 patients with hematological disorders who were at high risk for IA and diagnosed 9 proven IA cases, 2 probable IA cases, and 13 possible invasive fugal infections. Based on the ROC curve, the cutoff for the ELISA could be reduced to an optical density index (O.D.I.)</s><s>Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is among the most common invasive fungal infections in neutropenic patients with hematological disorders in the authors' institution, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital (KCMH), Bangkok, Thailand Previous studies have reported the Aspergillus galactomannan enzyme immunosorbent assay (GMEIA) may be a useful diagnostic tool for IA. The authors prospectively performed the study from June 2002 to January 2004 in a consecutive series of adult neutropenic patients with hematological disorders who were at risk for developing IA. The sensitivity and specificity of the GM EIA were calculated according to the proportion of patients with true and false positive and negative tests. There were 50 treatment episodes in 44 patients with 5 proven, 12 probable, and 33 possible or no IA. The GM EIA is a useful diagnostic toolfor the diagnosis and monitoring of the course oflA in the presented institute.</s><s>The occurrence of invasive fungal infection (IFIs) in a pediatric hematology/oncology unit after renovation of the ventilation system, and initiating routine azole antifungal prophylaxis was monitored. A total of 98 consecutive high-risk pediatric patients were prospectively surveyed for signs of IFI and weekly monitored for serum GM. The incidence of proven IFI was 1/31 (3.2%) in the allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) (Aspergillus spp), 0/26 in the autologous SCT, and 1/60 (1.6%) in the induction therapy group (C. krusei). In the latter group, IFI was proven in one patient and could not be excluded in the others. Four of the five patients belonged to the 31 allogeneic and one to the 26 autologous SCT patients. With the currently used preventative and prophylactic measures, IFI is uncommon in children with high-risk for infection.</s><s>To assess the Aspergillus galactomannan enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in adult and pediatric oncohematologic patients. A total of 3,294 serum samples were collected during 797 episodes (FUO, 261; PI, 297; NPA, 28; and surveillance, 211), and 153 episodes of IA were diagnosed (31 definite, 67 probable, and 55 possible). Three episodes were first suspected from galactomannan ELISA; the remaining 150 cases were diagnosed from clinical or radiologic evidence. Sensitivity of the ELISA was 64.5%, 16.4%, and 25.5% in definite, probable, and possible episodes of IA, respectively, and was lower in patients positive for anti-Aspergillus antibodies than in antibody-negative patients. Most false-positive results occurred in children and in allogeneic HSCT (allo-HSCT) patients. It was lower in children compared with adults (P <.0001) and in allo-HSCT patients compared with non-allo-HSCT adults (P =.0002).</s><s>The effectiveness of galactomannan detection with the Platelia test was evaluated in a prospective study of 3,327 sera from 807 patients. For the groups of patients with proven and probable invasive aspergillosis, the sensitivity was 50.0% (17 of 34 cases).</s><s>Current laboratory and radiological methods for diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) lack sensitivity and specificity. We prospectively evaluated the diagnostic value of twice-weekly screening for circulating Aspergillus fumigatus and A. flavus DNA with a polymerase chain reaction-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (PCR-ELISA). Among the 201 adult patients with hematological malignancies who were included in the study, 55 IA cases were diagnosed. On the basis of the analysis of 1205 serum samples from 167 patients, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the PCR-ELISA for proven and probable IA cases were 63.6%, 89.7%, 63.6%, and 89.7%, respectively, when samples with 2 consecutive positive results were used.</s><s>The performance of a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) which detects Aspergillus galactomannan (GM) was evaluated in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid samples from 19 patients who were treated for hematological malignancies and who were suspected of having invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). All patients had fever and pulmonary infiltrates on the chest roentgenogram on the day that the BAL fluid was obtained. Serum ELISA results were positive for all patients with ELISA-positive BAL fluid, and for four patients the serum ELISA was positive before the BAL fluid was obtained.</s><s>Invasive aspergillosis is difficult to diagnose in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In 2004, patients undergoing HSCT were screened biweekly with the galactomannan ELISA at our institution. We performed a retrospective chart review of 121 SCT patients who underwent galactomannan testing. When calculated in reference to a proved or probable diagnosis of aspergillosis, the galactomannan ELISA had a sensitivity of 0.50 and a specificity of 0.94. Galactomannan ELISA had fewer false-positive and false-negative results in pediatric patients than in adult patients. When used regularly, the ELISA may allow for earlier diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in some patients. The test is troubled by a low sensitivity and high frequency of false-negative tests.</s><s>Until recently, accurate microbiological diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) was seldom established in HSCT recipients. Implementing the international consensus defining the microbiological criteria for the diagnosis of Aspergillus infection, we retrospectively evaluated the role of serum galactomannan (GM) detection by EIA to diagnose IA among HSCT patients with proven invasive fungal infection (IFI) and the impact of serum storage in GM concentrations. Considering a lower cut-off level for the reaction (1.0), 80% of the cases could be categorized as \"probable\" aspergillosis. Retesting the stored samples after a second storage for four years, we could observe lower reactivity in 20% of the samples.</s><s>Reported sensitivity of the galactomannan enzyme immunoassay as an early diagnostic test for invasive aspergillosis (IA) has been widely variable, ranging from 29% to 100% in earlier clinical studies. Studies performed to date have analyzed performance using per-patient calculations, limiting their ability to measure the impact of clinical variables that change over time, such as receipt of preventive antifungal therapy. In our study, performance of the test was calculated in per-patient and per-test analyses in a large cohort of patients at high risk for IA from 2 North American centers. Per-patient calculations yielded sensitivities of 43% and 70% using index cutoff values of 1.5 and 0.5, respectively; specificity decreased from 93% with use of the 1.5 index cutoff to 70% with use of the 0.5 index cutoff.</s><s>To compare PCR with galactomannan antigen detection for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA). Patients were classified for potential IA according to international consensus criteria, with five patients classified as positive (four proven, one probable) and 20 classified as negative (seven possible, 13 no evidence IA). Three of 20 patients without IA were positive by PCR in 18 of 181 samples, whereas corresponding results for GM detection were one of 20 and one of 181, respectively. Adjustment of ELISA cut-off values and/or the requirement for two consecutive samples to be positive generated different results; however, lowering the positivity index (PI) for GM detection to 0.5 did not improve the sensitivity of the assay. Further evaluation of PCR assays for the diagnosis of IA and other invasive fungal infections is warranted.</s><s>To assess the clinical usefulness of a commercial aspergillus antigen enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in bone marrow transplant recipients, and to compare it with a commercial latex agglutination (LA) test. In total, 2026 serum samples from 104 bone marrow transplant recipients were tested. Twelve of 16 patients with confirmed or suspected IA were ELISA positive on two or more occasions, compared with 10 of 15 who were LA positive. Aspergillus antigen was detected by ELISA a median of 15 days before death (range, 4-233). Two samples (one from each of two patients without IA) gave false positive results. However, the test is insufficiently sensitive to diagnose aspergillosis before other symptoms or signs are apparent, and hence is unlikely to lead to earlier initiation of antifungal treatment. It is therefore unsuitable for screening of asymptomatic patients at risk of invasive aspergillosis, but does have a useful role in confirming the diagnosis in symptomatic patients.</s><s>Screening for galactomannan (GM) has been adopted by many European centers as part of the management plan for allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients. This statistical profile was better than that of other triggers, including unexplained fever, new pulmonary infiltrates, isolation of Aspergillus species, and abnormalities seen on computed tomography. Prospective screening for GM allows earlier diagnosis of aspergillosis than do conventional diagnostic criteria.</s><s>Many health care centers worldwide use the Platelia Aspergillus enzyme immunoassay (PA-EIA; Bio-Rad Laboratories) for diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA). Moreover, a cutoff OD index of 0.5 was recently approved in the United States. In total, 239 treatment episodes were included of which there were 19 episodes of proven IA and 19 episodes of probable IA. Per-episode and per-test analyses and receiver operating characteristic curves were used to determine the optimal cutoff value. A cutoff OD index of 0.5--identical to the approved cutoff in the United States--improves the overall performance of the PA-EIA for adult hematology patients.</s><s>The recent advent of an improved commercial serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of circulating galactomannan (GM), a major constituent of Aspergillus cell walls, has contributed to the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in many haematology and transplant centres. A further lowering of the 'static' threshold seems not clinically feasible given the drop in positive predictive value (PPV). However, the demonstration of at least two sequential sera with an OD > or = 0.5 ('dynamic' threshold) increased the specificity and the PPV to 98.6% and the efficiency to 98%. However, the clinical benefit of lower cut-offs (particularly for earlier diagnosis) depends upon the kinetics of antigenaemia and the intensity of serum sampling.</s><s>This study investigated the diagnostic value of Platelia Aspergillus enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for galactomannan (GM) antigen in patients at risk of invasive aspergillosis (IA), and its association with clinical course and outcome. Classification of IA was made on the basis of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer case definitions. Of the 189 patients, 5 had proven IA, 9 had probable IA, 26 had possible IA, and 149 had no IA. Diagnostic levels of GM were detected in 80% of proven and in 77% of probable IA cases. Regular monitoring of the kinetics of GM-EIA indices is a useful predictor of clinical course and outcome.</s><s>Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is an important cause of mortality in liver transplant patients. Clinical and microbiological diagnosis is difficult, and it is frequently achieved only after autopsy. Early diagnosis and antifungal therapy could improve the survival of these patients. In five of the nine case patients, a serum sample was positive for Aspergillus antigenemia detection. Sensitivity of the test was 55.6%, specificity was 93.9%, the positive predictive value was 71.4%, and the negative predictive value was 88.6%.</s><s>The incidence of invasive fungal infections is increasing in patients with hematological malignancies. Test positivity was defined in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. Over the 2 year study period, we analyzed 507 samples obtained during 193 neutropenic episodes from 135 patients. Forty-four positive (Index>1.5) and 26 'undetermined' (1.5 > Index > 1.0) test results were observed in 17 and ten patients respectively. Only one positive and one undetermined result were found in two patients before the onset of clinical or radiological signs suggesting invasive aspergillosis. Although the ELISA test did not appear to play a role in the early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis and in the anticipation of antifungal therapy in our experience, it clarifies the diagnosis of infection in probable or possible invasive aspergillosis especially when the cutoff value is lowered and is useful for monitoring patients receiving specific therapy.</s><s>Detection of serum galactomannan (GM) antigen and presence of the halo sign on a pulmonary computerized tomographic (CT) scan have a high specificity but a low sensitivity to diagnose invasive aspergillosis (IA) in patients at risk for this disease. In a prospective study, tests for detection of GM were performed twice weekly for patients with hematological malignancies who had undergone hematopoetic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or had received induction and/or consolidation chemotherapy. A total of 109 episodes with no IA, 32 episodes with possible IA, and 20 episodes with probable or proven IA were identified. Minor pulmonary signs were detected by CT in 70 episodes (43%), and major pulmonary signs were detected by CT in 11 episodes (7%). GM test results were not positive before major signs were seen on CT images. Only 7 (10%) of 70 patients with minor pulmonary signs had positive GM test results before detection of the greatest pathologic change by CT.\n                We show that detection of GM by EIA does not precede detection of major lesions by pulmonary CT.</s><s>Invasive aspergillosis (IA) has become the leading infectious cause of death after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). This is partially because of the lack of a sensitive, specific, and noninvasive diagnostic test. This study validates the usefulness of this diagnostic tool in the allo-HSCT setting. Proven, probable, and possible IA were defined according to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group criteria. The sensitivity and specificity of the test were 75% and 100%, respectively.</s>"

The 24-wk mortality rate was 70.8/1000 live births in the placebo group, comparable with rates in the vitamin A and beta-carotene groups, which had relative risks of 1.05 (95% CI: 0.87, 1.25) and 1.03 (95% CI: 0.86, 1.22), respectively. Small weekly doses of vitamin A or beta-carotene given to women before conception, during pregnancy, and through 24 wk postpartum did not improve fetal or early infant survival in Nepal.</s><s>Vitamin A deficiency is associated with increased morbidity and mortality from diarrheal disease, measles, and malaria. Vitamin A supplementation had no apparent impact upon linear or ponderal growth or infectious disease morbidity in the first 15 mo of age when integrated with the Expanded Programme on Immunization. Although improving vitamin A nutriture is of general importance in reducing diarrheal and measles morbidity and mortality in developing countries, this clinical trial showed no apparent benefit of vitamin A capsules for infant health when given through childhood immunization programs.</s><s>To investigate the effect of high dose vitamin A supplementation given with BCG vaccine at birth in an African setting with high infant mortality. Vitamin A supplementation was not significantly associated with mortality; the mortality rate ratio was 1.07 (95% confidence interval 0.79 to 1.44). The mortality rate ratio in boys was 0.84 (0.55 to 1.27) compared with 1.39 (0.90 to 2.14) in girls (P for interaction=0.10). Although little doubt exists that vitamin A supplementation reduces mortality in older children, a global recommendation of supplementation for all newborn infants may not contribute to better survival.</s><s>To explore the effect of maternal supplementation of vitamin A on the immune response to oral polio vaccine in breastfed infants. All the newborns were given a dose of oral polio vaccine within 72 hours after birth and were breastfed. Breast milk retinol levels were determined at 3, 10, 30, 45 and 90 days of lactation. Breast milk retinol levels were significantly higher in the experimental group upto 45-90 days of lactation. Maternal vitamin A supplementation soon after delivery improves vitamin A intakes of breastfed infants during the first 3 months and has no interference with the seroconversion to a neonatal dose of OPV.</s><s>It has been suggested that administering vitamin A with the measles vaccine may reduce the vaccine's immunogenicity. This trial examined the effect of supplementing vitamin A during the early months of life on infants' immune responses to tetanus and polio vaccines. A 4th group in which mother and child were given placebos served as controls. Blood samples were collected from each child at 6 wk and 6 mo of age to measure antipolio antibody titer, antitetanus toxoid antibodies, and avidity of antibodies to tetanus.</s><s>To evaluate the safety of vitamin A supplementation in early infancy using DPT/OPV immunization contracts, a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in Bangladesh. One hundred and sixty-seven infants received three doses of either 25,000 IU of vitamin A or a placebo at about 6.5, 11.8 and 17.0 weeks of age. Of these 12 episodes, none occurred with the first dose, 3 occurred with the second and 9 with the third dose. The higher incidence of bulging of the fontanelle in the vitamin A group relative to the placebo group and its temporal association with the vitamin A doses are suggestive of a causal association.</s><s>A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the safety and toxicity of vitamin A supplementation within the Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) in rural Bangladesh. 191 infants received 3 doses of either 50,000 IU of vitamin A or placebo at about 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5 months and were examined on days 1, 2, 3, and 8 after supplementation. There was a tendency towards a cumulative effect of toxicity with increasing doses.</s><s>The effect of supplementing 11,918 infants < 1 mo and 1-5 mo of age with vitamin A (15,000 and 30,000 micrograms retinol equivalents or 50,000 and 100,000 IU, respectively) or a placebo on subsequent 4-mo mortality was assessed in a randomized, double-masked community trial in the rural plains of Nepal. These results suggest that distribution of a large oral dose of vitamin A to infants < 5-6 mo of age may not benefit short-term survival. This is in contrast with the results of trials in which older infants and children in this same population were supplemented.</s><s>We assessed the effect of supplementing newborns with 50000 IU of vitamin A on all-cause infant mortality through 24 weeks of age. Study-defined sectors (N = 596) were evenly randomized for newborns of participating mothers to receive a single, oral supplement of vitamin A (50000 IU) or placebo as droplets of oil squeezed from a gelatinous capsule. Mothers provided informed consent for newborn participation at approximately 28 weeks' gestation. Dosed infants (n = 15902 [99.8%]) received their study supplement at a median age of 7 hours. Protective relative risks were indistinguishable by infant gender, gestational age, birth weight, age at dosing, maternal age, parity, or across the 3 treatment arms of the maternal supplementation trial. Newborn vitamin A dosing improved infant survival through the first 6 months of life in Bangladesh.</s><s>Postpartum vitamin A supplementation of mothers and infants is recommended, but the efficacy has been questioned. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, Kenyan mother-infant pairs were randomised to maternal vitamin A (400,000 IU) or placebo <24 h postpartum, and infant vitamin A (100,000 IU) or placebo at 14 weeks. Among 564 women, serum retinol at 36 weeks gestation was 0.81 (SD 0.21) micromol/l, and 33.3% were<0.7 micromol/l. When expressed per gram fat, milk retinol was higher in the vitamin A group only at 4 weeks. However, although most infants had deficient vitamin A stores (MRDR>0.06%) at 26 weeks, vitamin A to infants, but not mothers, resulted in a lower proportion of infants with deficient vitamin A stores (69 v. 78 %). There is a need for a better understanding of factors affecting absorption and metabolism of vitamin A.</s><s>To investigate the effect of vitamin A supplementation and BCG vaccination at birth in low birthweight neonates. Vitamin A supplementation at birth was not significantly associated with mortality: the MRR of vitamin A supplementation compared with placebo, controlled for randomisation to \"early BCG\" versus \"no early BCG\" was 1.08 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.47). Stratification by sex revealed a significant interaction between vitamin A supplementation and sex (P=0.046), the MRR of vitamin A supplementation being 0.74 (95% CI 0.45 to 1.22) in boys and 1.42 (95% CI 0.94 to 2.15) in girls. The combined results of this trial and the complementary trial among normal birthweight neonates have now shown that, overall, it would not be beneficial to implement a neonatal vitamin A supplementation policy in Guinea-Bissau. Previous studies and future trials should investigate the possibility that vitamin A supplementation has sex differential effects.</s>"

        "Abstracts": "<s>The efficacy of neurolytic coeliac plexus block (NCPB) guided by computerized tomography (CT) was compared with pharmacological therapy in the treatment of pain due to pancreatic cancer. The study involved 56 patients who were placed randomly in either a NCPB group and pharmacological therapy group. However, the differences in the improvement of quality of life (QOL) between two groups were not statistically significant. Moreover, the dose of opioid was significantly lower in the patients of group 1 than those of group 2, while the complications related to NCPB were transient.</s><s>Twenty-one patients with pancreatic cancer pain were studied to evaluate the effectiveness of celiac plexus block (CPB) on pain relief and quality of life (QOL), compared to the traditional NSAID-morphine treatment. Morphine consumption, VAS, PS, and self-assessed QOL scores were taken when the administration of morphine was necessary for pain relief and those scores were used as control. Morphine consumption and the VAS score were recorded at regular weekly intervals and the PS and QOL scores were measured every 2 weeks thereafter. Although the PS score slightly improved at the 2nd week after CPB, it was not improved by the start of the NSAID-morphine treatment. These results indicate CPB does not directly improve QOL in patients with pancreatic cancer pain, but it may prevent deterioration in QOL by the long-lasting analgesic effect, limitation of side effects and the reduction of morphine consumption, compared to treatment only with NSAID-morphine.</s><s>A prospective, randomized, double-blind study was completed comparing intraoperative chemical splanchnicectomy with 50% alcohol versus a placebo injection of saline in patients with histologically proven unresectable pancreatic cancer. The two groups were similar with respect to age, sex, location, and stage of tumor, operation performed, the use of postoperative chemo- and radiation therapy, and initial assessment scores for pain, mood, and disability. No differences in hospital mortality or complications, return to oral intake, or length of hospital stay were observed. To further determine the effect of chemical splanchnicectomy, patients were stratified into those with and without preoperative pain. In patients without preoperative pain, alcohol significantly reduced pain scores and delayed or prevented the subsequent onset of pain (p < 0.05). The results suggest that intraoperative chemical splanchnicectomy with alcohol significantly reduces or prevents pain in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer.</s><s>In a randomized double-blind study the efficacy of neurolytic coeliac plexus block (NCPB) was compared with pharmacological therapy in the treatment of pain from pancreatic cancer. Statistical analysis was performed with the unpaired t test, Mann-Whitney U test and Fisher's exact test. Immediately after the block, patients in group 1 reported significant pain relief compared with those in group 2 (P < 0.05), but long-term results did not differ between the groups. Complications related to NCPB were transient diarrhoea and hypotension (P not significant between groups).</s><s>To test the hypothesis that neurolytic celiac plexus block (NCPB) vs opioids alone improves pain relief, QOL, and survival in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either NCPB or systemic analgesic therapy alone with a sham injection. All patients could receive additional opioids managed by a clinician blinded to the treatment assignment. The first week after randomization, pain intensity and QOL scores were improved (pain intensity, P< or =.01 for both groups; QOL, P<.001 for both groups), with a larger decrease in pain for the NCPB group (P =.005). However, opioid consumption (P =.93), frequency of opioid adverse effects (all P>.10), and QOL (P =.46) were not significantly different between groups. However, survival did not differ significantly between groups (P =.26, proportional hazards regression).</s>"

        "Abstracts": "<s>Aerobic exercise training has been shown to have beneficial effects on quality of life (QOL) in breast cancer survivors. However, the effects of weight training on psychological benefits are unknown. Over 6 months the physical global QOL score improved in the treatment group compared with the control group (Standardized Difference = 0.62, P = .006). The psychosocial global score also improved significantly in the treatment group compared with the control group (Standardized Difference = 0.52, P = .02). Increases in upper body strength were correlated with improvements in physical global score (r = 0.32; P <.01) and psychosocial global score (r = 0.30; P <.01). Twice-weekly weight training for recent breast cancer survivors may result in improved QOL, in part via changes in body composition and strength.</s><s>Physical exercise has been shown to enhance quality of life (QOL) in cancer survivors using pretest-posttest designs and compared to usual care (i.e. In the present study, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to determine if exercise could improve QOL in cancer survivors beyond the known benefits of group psychotherapy (GP). We had excellent recruitment (81%), retention (89%), and adherence (84%) rates and a modest contamination (22%) rate. We also found borderline significant interactions for physical well-being, satisfaction with life, and flexibility.</s><s>We conducted a randomized controlled trial to determine the effects of a home-based exercise intervention on change in quality of life (QOL) in recently resected colorectal cancer survivors, most of whom were receiving adjuvant therapy. Participants were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to either an exercise (n = 69) or control (n = 33) group. The exercise group was asked to perform moderate intensity exercise 3-5 times per week for 20-30 min each time. The primary outcome was change in QOL as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Colorectal (FACT-C) scale. Intention-to-treat analysis revealed no significant differences between groups for change in the FACT-C (mean difference, -1.3; 95% CI, -7.8 to 5.1; P = 0.679).</s><s>To determine the effects of exercise training on cardiopulmonary function and quality of life (QOL) in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors who had completed surgery, radiotherapy, and/or chemotherapy with or without current hormone therapy use. Fifty-three postmenopausal breast cancer survivors were randomly assigned to an exercise (n = 25) or control (n = 28) group. Peak oxygen consumption was assessed by a graded exercise test using gas exchange analysis. Overall QOL was assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast scale. Peak oxygen consumption increased by 0.24 L/min in the exercise group, whereas it decreased by 0.05 L/min in the control group (mean difference, 0.29 L/min; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.18 to 0.40; P <.001).</s><s>To determine the effect of exercise on quality of life in (a) a randomized controlled trial of exercise among recently diagnosed breast cancer survivors undergoing adjuvant therapy and (b) a similar trial among post-treatment survivors. Fifty newly diagnosed breast cancer survivors were recruited through a hospital-based tumor registry and randomized to a 6-month, home-based exercise program (n=25) or a usual care group (n=25). Forty-five participants completed the trial for newly diagnosed survivors and 67 completed the trial for post-treatment survivors. Exercise did not affect quality of life in either recently diagnosed or post-treatment breast cancer survivors; however this may be due in part to relatively high baseline functioning among participants in both studies. Strategies for future research include limiting enrollment to survivors who report reduced quality of life on screening questionnaires and targeting survivor subgroups known to be at particular risk for quality of life impairment.</s><s>To evaluate the effects of 10 weeks of aerobic exercise on depressive and anxiety symptoms and self-esteem of breast cancer survivors. Twenty-four breast cancer survivors (mean time following surgery 41.8 months; ranging from 1 to 99 months) recruited via mail and cancer support groups. Subjects were assigned randomly into exercise (EX), exercise-plus-behavior modification (EX + BM), and control groups. EX and EX + BM groups exercised aerobically four days/week at > or = 60% of age-predicted maximum heart rate for 10 weeks. Pre- to post-test analyses revealed that women who exercised had significantly less depression and state and trait anxiety over time compared to controls. Subjects who received exercise recommendations from their physicians exercised significantly more than subjects who received no recommendation. Mild to moderate aerobic exercise may be of therapeutic value to breast cancer survivors with respect to depressive and anxiety symptoms but not to self-esteem.</s><s>This study examines the impact of yoga, including physical poses, breathing, and meditation exercises, on quality of life (QOL), fatigue, distressed mood, and spiritual well-being among a multiethnic sample of breast cancer patients. One hundred twenty-eight patients (42% African American, 31% Hispanic) recruited from an urban cancer center were randomly assigned (2:1 ratio) to a 12-week yoga intervention (n = 84) or a 12-week waitlist control group (n = 44). Regression analyses indicated that the control group had a greater decrease in social well-being compared with the intervention group after controlling for baseline social well-being and covariates (P < .0001). Sixty-nine percent of intervention participants attended classes (mean number of classes attended by active class participants = 7.00 +/- 3.80), with lower adherence associated with increased fatigue (P < .001), radiotherapy (P < .0001), younger age (P < .008), and no antiestrogen therapy (P < .02). Despite limited adherence, this intent-to-treat analysis suggests that yoga is associated with beneficial effects on social functioning among a medically diverse sample of breast cancer survivors.</s><s>Substantial numbers of cancer patients use complementary medicine therapies, even without a supportive evidence base. This study aimed to evaluate in a randomized controlled trial, the use of Medical Qigong (MQ) compared with usual care to improve the quality of life (QOL) of cancer patients.

Eighteen (N=18) colon cancer survivors (mean age=69y; range, 52-80y), Dukes stage A to C.\n                Participants were randomized 6 to 24 months postoperatively to either a 12-week program of combined exercise and dietary advice or standard treatment. Exercise and dietary behavior, fatigue, health-related quality of life (QOL), aerobic exercise tolerance, functional capacity, muscle strength, and anthropometery were assessed at baseline and immediately after the intervention. Adherences to supervised and independent exercise during the intervention were 90% and 94%, respectively, and there was low attrition (6%). These findings need to be confirmed with a larger-scale definitive randomized controlled trial.</s><s>The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of a twice-weekly strength training intervention on perceptions of body image in 234 breast cancer survivors (112 with lymphedema) who participated in the Physical Activity and Lymphedema (PAL) trial. Percent change in baseline to 12-month BIRS total and subscale scores, upper and lower body strength, and general quality of life (QOL) were compared by intervention status. Strength and QOL variables were assessed as mediators of the intervention effect on BIRS. Results: Baseline BIRS scores were similar across intervention and lymphedema status. Significantly greater improvement in BIRS total score was observed from baseline to 12 months in treatment vs. control participants (12.0 vs. 2.0%; P < 0.0001). Evidence suggests the intervention was beneficial regardless of prior diagnosis of lymphedema.</s><s>Cancer-related fatigue is the most disabling symptom experienced by breast cancer patients following the cancer treatment. In a randomized controlled study the effects of a structured physical training program on fatigue and health-related quality of life were evaluated. There was an improvement of muscle strength at the end of rehabilitation for both groups. The scores for global quality of life, physical well-being, and functionality increased from t1 to t2, but further improvement in the follow-up (t3) was only observed in the training group. Structured physical training programs initiated during inpatient rehabilitation and continuously practiced in the time thereafter can improve symptoms of chronic fatigue and quality of life in breast cancer patients.</s><s>Few randomized controlled trials have examined the effects of combined aerobic and resistance training in breast cancer survivors soon after completing adjuvant therapy. The IEG completed 12 weeks of supervised aerobic and resistance exercise, three times per week. Follow-up data was obtained on 97% of participants and exercise adherence was 61.3%. Repeated measures analyses of variance revealed a significant group by time interaction for overall QoL (P<0.001). From 12 to 24 weeks, QoL increased in the DEG by 29.5 points compared to an increase of 6.5 points in the IEG (mean group difference=23.0; 95% CI=16.3-29.1; P<0.001). Combined aerobic and resistance exercise soon after the completion of breast cancer therapy produces large and rapid improvements in health-related outcomes.</s><s>To examine the effects of aerobic exercise therapy on quality of life (QoL) and associated outcomes in women treated for breast cancer. Exercise therapy and exercise-placebo sessions took place three times per week for 8 weeks. Outcomes included QoL, depression, exercise behavior, aerobic fitness; outcomes were assessed at baseline and at the 8- and 24-week follow-up. Analyses of covariance revealed a significant mean difference of 9.8 units in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (primary outcome) favoring aerobic exercise therapy at 8 weeks, relative to usual care. Psychological health outcomes improved modestly for both intervention groups; these improvements were sustained for several end points.</s><s>Patients who undergo hematopoietic SCT (HSCT) often experience physical and psychological problems, even long after treatment has been completed. This study was performed to evaluate the effects of a 12-week outpatient physical exercise (PE) program, incorporating aerobic and strength exercises, as compared with a usual care control condition on patients' physical performance and psychosocial well-being. Patients who had completed HSCT up to 6 months earlier were randomly assigned to a supervised PE program (n=64) or a usual care control group (n=67). Primary outcomes were quantified physical performance and self-reported physical functioning.</s><s>Interventions to increase physical activity among breast cancer survivors are needed to improve health and quality of life and possibly to reduce the risk of disease recurrence and early mortality. Recruitment was 34%, intervention adherence was 99%, and complete follow-up data were obtained on 93%. Differences favoring the intervention group were noted for accelerometer physical activity counts (mean difference = 72,103; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 25,383-119,000; effect size (d) = 1.02; P = 0.004), aerobic fitness (mean difference = 2.9; 95% CI = -0.1 to 5.8; d = 0.64; P = 0.058), back/leg muscle strength (mean difference = 12.3; 95% CI = 0.4-15.9; d = 0.81; P = 0.017), waist-to-hip ratio (mean difference = -0.05; 95% CI = -0.01 to -0.08; d = -0.77; P = 0.018), and social well-being (mean difference = 2.0; 95% CI = 0.3-3.8; d = 0.76; P = 0.03).</s><s>In a randomised prospective study, a brief structured rehabilitation programme, 'Starting Again', was evaluated over a follow-up year. 98 patients were assigned to the programme, and 101 to the control condition.

Traditional Iyengar yoga routines that progressively increased in difficulty as participants gained strength and flexibility were used. At baseline and after the 8-week study period, women completed self-report instruments to document various aspects of psychosocial and physical functioning, and collected salivary samples for cortisol analysis four times during the day for two consecutive days. Breast cancer survivors are at risk for chronic psychosocial distress that may alter activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, resulting in aberrant regulation of cortisol secretion and increased risk of immune dysfunction and cancer progression. ©2010 The Author(s) Journal compilation ©2010 American Academy of Nurse Practitioners.</s><s>Few studies have evaluated an individualized home-based exercise prescription during and after cancer treatment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a home-based exercise training intervention, the Pro-self Fatigue Control Program on the management of cancer-related fatigue. Patients completed the Piper Fatigue Scale, General Sleep Disturbance Scale, Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale, and Worst Pain Intensity Scale. All groups reported mild fatigue levels, sleep disturbance, and mild pain, but not depression. Clinicians need to be aware that some physical activity is better than none, and there is no harm in exercise as tolerated during cancer treatment. More frequent assessments of fatigue, sleep disturbance, depression, and pain may capture the effect of exercise.</s><s>The efficacy of a home-based physical activity (PA) intervention for early-stage breast cancer patients was evaluated in a randomized controlled trial. Eighty-six sedentary women (mean age, 53.14 years; standard deviation, 9.70 years) who had completed treatment for stage 0 to II breast cancer were randomly assigned to a PA or contact control group. Assessments were conducted at baseline, after treatment (12 weeks), and 6 and 9 month after baseline follow-ups. The PA group was more likely than controls to progress in motivational readiness for PA and to meet PA guidelines. No significant group differences were found in body mass index and percent body fat. Post-treatment group comparisons revealed significant improvements in vigor and a reduction in fatigue in the PA group.</s><s>Exercise participation has been shown to improve cardiovascular fitness and reduce psychological distress among women receiving chemotherapy and/or radiation. The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the changes in distress and body image, and fitness following exercise participation among 24 women who had been diagnosed with breast cancer within the previous 3 years. The women were randomly assigned to participate in a 12-week supervised aerobic exercise program in a hospital setting or a wait-list control group. Data showed that the women in the exercise group improved significantly in body image (Physical Condition and Weight Concerns subscales) vs control group participants at post-treatment.</s><s>The primary purpose of this study was to examine the effect of aerobic exercise on physiological and psychological function in patients rehabilitating from cancer treatment. A second purpose was to evaluate the differential effects of low- and moderate-intensity exercise on these variables. The exercise groups performed lower-body aerobic exercise three times a week for 10 wk. Therefore, the exercise groups were combined into one group for the final analysis. Low- and moderate-intensity aerobic-exercise programs were equally effective in improving physiological and psychological function in this population of cancer survivors. Aerobic exercise appears to be a valuable and well-tolerated component of the cancer-rehabilitation process.</s><s>Restorative yoga (RY) is a gentle type of yoga that may be beneficial for cancer patients and post-treatment survivors. Study participants were randomized to the intervention (10 weekly 75-minute RY classes) or a waitlist control group. Significant baseline*group interactions were observed for negative affect and emotional well-being. Women with higher negative affect and lower emotional well-being at baseline derived greater benefit from the yoga intervention compared to those with similar values at baseline in the control group. Although limited by sample size, these pilot data suggest potential benefit of RY on emotional outcomes and fatigue in cancer patients.</s><s>The study aimed at investigating the quality of life (QoL) and physical performance and activity, and their interrelations, in Finnish female breast cancer patients shortly after adjuvant treatments. Physical activity was measured by a questionnaire and a prospective two-week diary. Results: About 26% of the patients were rated as depressed, 20.4% as fatigued, and 82% suffered from menopausal symptoms. Physical activity level correlated positively to physical performance (r = -0.274, p<0.0001). The QoL of the patients shortly after adjuvant treatments was impaired and the physical performance poor as compared to general population. Thus, physical exercise could be useful in rehabilitation of cancer survivors, especially for depressed and fatigued patients.</s><s>Lymphoma patients commonly experience declines in physical functioning and quality of life (QoL) that may be reversed with exercise training. Follow-up assessment for our primary end point was 96% (117 of 122) at postintervention and 90% (110 of 122) at 6-month follow-up. Change in peak cardiovascular fitness mediated the change in patient-rated physical functioning. AET did not interfere with chemotherapy completion rate or treatment response. At 6-month follow-up, AET was still borderline or significantly superior to UC for overall QoL (P = .054), happiness (P = .034), and depression (P = .009) without an increased risk of disease recurrence/progression.</s><s>Aerobic exercise and psychosocial interventions have been shown to reduce the severity of this symptom in cancer patients. Seventy-two patients who underwent surgery for lung (n=27) or gastrointestinal tumours (n=42) were assigned to an aerobic exercise group (stationary biking 30 min five times weekly) or a progressive relaxation training group (45 min three times per week). At the beginning and the end of the study, we evaluated physical, cognitive and emotional status and somatic complaints with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core Module (EORTC-QLQ-30) questionnaire, and maximal physical performance with an ergometric stress test. Physical performance of the training group improved significantly during the programme (9.4+/-20 watts, p=0.01) but remained unchanged in the relaxation group (1.5+/-14.8 watts, p=0.37).</s><s>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a comprehensive group rehabilitation program on the range of motion of the shoulder joint, psychosocial adjustment, and the quality of life for early breast cancer patients. Fifty-five women with early breast cancer were assigned to an intervention group or a control group.</s><s>The purpose of this randomized control trial was to verify the effectiveness of a brief group intervention that combines stress management psycho-education and physical activity (ie, independent variable) intervention in reducing fatigue and improving energy level, quality of life (mental and physical), fitness (VO 2submax), and emotional distress (ie, dependent variables) in breast cancer survivors. This study applied Lazarus and Folkman stress-coping theoretical framework, as well as Salmon's unifying theory of physical activity. Eighty-seven French-speaking women who had completed their treatments for nonmetastatic breast cancer at a university hospital in Quebec City, Canada, were randomly assigned to either the group intervention (experimental) or the usual-care (control) condition.</s><s>To evaluate the effectiveness of a supervised home-based flexible training program on cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), mental distress, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) parameters in young and middle-aged cancer patients shortly after curative chemotherapy. One hundred eleven patients age 18 to 50 years who had received chemotherapy for lymphomas or breast, gynecologic, or testicular cancer completed the trial. Primary outcome was change in CRF, as determined by Astrand-Rhyming indirect bicycle ergometer test (maximum oxygen uptake [VO(2max)]), between baseline (T0) and follow-up (T1). VO(2max) increased by 6.4 mL/kg(-1)/min(-1) in patients in the intervention group and by 3.1 mL/kg(-1)/min(-1) in patients in the control group (P < .01). A supervised, home-based, flexible training program has significant effect on CRF in young and middle-aged cancer patients shortly after curative chemotherapy, but it has no favorable effect on patients' experience of fatigue, mental distress, or HRQOL.</s><s>Research suggests that stress-reduction programs tailored to the cancer setting help patients cope with the effects of treatment and improve their quality of life. The authors examined the effects of the Tibetan yoga (TY) practices of Tsa lung and Trul khor, which incorporate controlled breathing and visualization, mindfulness techniques, and low-impact postures in patients with lymphoma. Thirty-nine patients with lymphoma who were undergoing treatment or who had concluded treatment within the past 12 months were assigned to a TY group or to a wait-list control group. Eighty nine percent of TY participants completed at least 2-3 three yoga sessions, and 58% completed at least 5 sessions. Patients in the TY group reported significantly lower sleep disturbance scores during follow-up compared with patients in the wait-list control group (5.8 vs. 8.1; P < 0.004). However, there were no significant differences between groups for the other outcomes.</s><s>1) To determine the effect of a home-based walking exercise program on the sleep quality and quality of life of cancer patients, as well as 2) to determine if enhanced sleep quality was associated with improvement in quality of life over time. Participants were recruited from oncology outpatient clinics in two university-based medical centers and were allocated to either usual care (n = 35) or a home-based walking exercise intervention for 8 weeks (n = 36). Effects of the walking exercise program on sleep quality and quality of life were analyzed by the generalized estimating equation method. Among patients who exercised, enhanced sleep quality also corresponded with reduced bodily pain (beta = 0.98, p = 0.04) and improvements over time in the mental health dimension of quality of life (beta = -3.87, p < 0.01).</s><s>To compare the effectiveness of a prescribed home-based walking exercise intervention with usual care in older women receiving hormonal treatment for breast cancer, and to examine relationships among levels of the cortisol, serotonin, interleukin-6, and bilirubin biomarkers and fatigue, sleep disturbances, and depressive symptoms. A National Cancer Institute-designated cancer center in the southeastern United States. 20 women (aged 55 years or older) with breast cancer receiving hormonal treatment. Participants were randomized to a walking exercise intervention or usual care.

The TCC group demonstrated significant improvements in HRQL, while the PST group reported declines in HRQL, with the differences between the two groups approaching significance at week 12. Additionally, the TCC group exhibited improvements in self-esteem, while the PST group reported declines in self-esteem, with the differences between groups reaching statistical significance at week 12. These findings, coupled with a visual inspection of the raw change scores, support the plausibility of a dose-response relationship concerning Tai Chi.</s><s>Quality of life (QOL) of cancer patients is often diminished due to the side effects of treatment and symptoms of the disease itself. Medical Qigong (coordination of gentle exercise and relaxation through meditation and breathing exercise based on Chinese medicine theory of energy channels) may be an effective therapy for improving QOL, symptoms and side effects, and longevity of cancer patients. In this pilot study, the feasibility, acceptability, and impact of Medical Qigong (MQ) were evaluated on outcomes in cancer patients. Thirty patients diagnosed with heterogeneous cancers, were randomly assigned to two groups: a control group that received usual medical care and an intervention group who participated in a MQ program for 8 weeks in addition to receiving usual medical care. Randomization was stratified by completion of cancer treatment (n = 14) or under chemotherapy (n = 16). Due to the small sample size, however, the results were not statistically significant between treatment and the control groups.</s><s>Shoulder pain and disability are well recognized complications associated with surgery for head and neck cancer. This study was designed to examine the effects of progressive resistance exercise training (PRET) on upper extremity pain and dysfunction in postsurgical head and neck cancer survivors. The primary endpoint was change in patient-rated shoulder pain and disability from baseline to postintervention. Follow-up assessment for the primary outcome was 92%, and adherence to the supervised PRET and TP programs were 95% and 87%, respectively. On the basis of intention-to-treat analyses, PRET was superior to TP for improving shoulder pain and disability (-9.6; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], -16.4 to -4.5; P = .001), upper extremity strength (+10.8 kg; 95% CI, 5.4-16.2 kg; P < .001), and upper extremity endurance (+194 repetitions x kg; 95% CI, 10-378 repetitions x kg; P = .039).</s><s>Physical activity provides a number of physical and psychological benefits to cancer survivors, including lessening the impact of detrimental cancer-related symptoms and treatment side-effects (e.g. The purpose of the present pilot study was to examine the physical and psychological benefits afforded by a 7-week yoga program for cancer survivors.

Participants in the CAM group were taught the use of meditation, affirmation, imagery and ritual. The standard group combined cognitive-behavioral approaches with group sharing and support. At the end of the intervention, the CAM group showed higher satisfaction (P=0.006) and fewer dropouts (P=0.006) compared to the standard group. In summary, the study found equivalence on most psychosocial outcomes between the two interventions.</s><s>Since physical exercise programs have the potential to help cancer patients regain physical fitness and may exert a range of positive consequences for recovery and psychological well-being, the impact of a physical exercise program was investigated in this prospective study. Women with primary nonmetastatic breast cancer after a minimum 4-week period post chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy completion were randomly assigned to one of 2 groups: intervention group (IG) (n = 30) and waiting group (WG) (n = 28). The 10-week twice weekly exercise group program consisted of gymnastics, movement games, relaxation, walking, and jogging. Maximal oxygen uptake (VO(2)max/kg) was assessed as a measure of physical fitness.</s><s>The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the effects of a combined cardiorespiratory and resistance exercise training program of short duration on the cardiorespiratory fitness, strength endurance, task specific functional muscle capacity, body composition and quality of life (QOL) in women breast cancer survivors.

A two arm, single blind, randomised controlled trial was conducted within the Northern Ireland regional Cancer Centre. Participants were 8.7 (SD=9.1) months post diagnosis, with a mean age of 53 (SD=10.3) years. Significant differences favouring the intervention group were observed for fatigue at 12 weeks and 6 months follow-up (12 week: mean difference=-11.06; 95% confidence interval (CI)=-21.89 to -0.23; effect size (d)=0.13; p=0.046; 6 month: mean difference=-19.48; 95% CI=-19.67 to -19.15; effect size (d)=0.20; p=0.01). The intervention was positively perceived based on exit questionnaire and focus group findings. A physical activity behavioural change intervention for gynaecological cancer survivors is feasible in terms of participants' programme adherence and evaluation, and the intervention demonstrates improvements in fatigue.

Bupivacaine hydrochloride (8-10 mg) and fentanyl (10 microg) were injected into the intervertebral space for spinal anesthesia. The study was carried out at the Anesthesiology Department, Hacettepe University, Turkey, hospitalized care. The incidence of nausea, retching, and vomiting was significantly higher in the control group, compared to the propofol and midazolam groups.

There were no significant differences in the incidence and severity of IONV between the two groups (22.5 versus 23%). The top-up antiemetic drug was used in the same number of patients in each group. Although 10 mg propofol has been described as an effective direct antiemetic, episodes of IONV were neither prevented nor reversed by its use during intradural anesthesia for cesarean delivery.</s><s>Subarachnoid block is the preferred method of anaesthesia for caesarean section, but is associated with hypotension and bradycardia, which may be deleterious to both parturient and baby. In this study, we evaluated the effect of ondansetron, as a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, on the haemodynamic response following subarachnoid block in parturients undergoing elective caesarean section. Before induction of spinal anaesthesia Group O (n=26) received intravenous ondansetron 4 mg; Group S (n=26) received normal saline. Decreases in mean arterial pressure were significantly lower in Group O than Group S from 14 min until 35 min. Ondansetron 4 mg, given intravenously 5 min before subarachnoid block reduced hypotension and vasopressor use in parturients undergoing elective caesarean section.</s><s>Nausea and vomiting are major adverse effects during spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery. Stimulation of the P6 (Neiguan) acupoint is a traditional Chinese acupuncture technique used for effective antiemetic purposes. In this study, we evaluated the antiemetic effect of P6 acupressure in parturients during spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery. Thirty minutes before initiation of spinal anesthesia, parturients were randomized to acupressure bands or placebo bands bilaterally on the P6 acupoint and nausea and vomiting were observed over the study period. There were no statistically significant differences in maternal characteristics.</s><s>This study compares intrathecal (IT) fentanyl with IV ondansetron for preventing intraoperative nausea and vomiting during cesarean deliveries performed with spinal anesthesia. At eight specific intervals during the surgery, a blinded observer questioned the patient about nausea (1 = nausea, 0 = no nausea), observed for the presence of retching or vomiting (1 = vomiting or retching, 0 = no vomiting or retching), and recorded a verbal pain score (0-10, 0 = no pain, 10 = worst pain imaginable). Cumulative nausea, vomiting, and pain scores were calculated as the sum of the eight measurements. Intraoperative nausea was decreased in the IT fentanyl group compared with the IV ondansetron group: the median (interquartile range) difference in nausea scores was 1 (1, 2), P = 0.03. The median difference in the cumulative fentanyl dose was 100 (75, 100) microg fentanyl, (P = 0.0002).</s><s>The efficacy of acupressure at the P6 point in the prevention of nausea and vomiting during and after Caesarean section was studied. The use of acupressure reduced the incidence of nausea or vomiting from 53% to 23% compared with placebo (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34-0.25; P = 0.002) during the operation and from 66% to 36% compared with placebo (95% CI 0.34-0.19; P = 0.003) after the operation.</s><s>Nausea and vomiting occur frequently during cesarean section under spinal anesthesia. Metoclopramide reduces intraoperative nausea and vomiting, but not without potential side effects. Seventy-five patients were studied in a randomized, prospective, double-blind comparative trial. Patients who received either acupressure or metoclopramide prior to initiation of spinal anesthesia for cesarean section had much less nausea than patients in the placebo group. Acupressure is an effective, non-pharmacologic method to reduce intraoperative nausea during elective cesarean section in the awake patient.</s><s>Supplemental oxygen can reduce the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting in patients under general anesthesia. The objective of the present study was to determine the efficacy of supplemental oxygen to reduce the incidence of perioperative nausea and vomiting in elective cesareans under subarachnoid block. Demographic and perioperative parameters, as well as the data on the newborn, were comparable in both groups. In Group O, the incidence of nausea during the surgery, in the first 6 hours afterwards, and between 6 and 24 hours was 35%, 30%, and 19%, respectively, while in Group S, it was 35%, 30%, and 19%, respectively.</s><s>To assess the safety and efficacy of ondansetron for prevention of pruritus, nausea and vomiting after cesarean delivery with intrathecal sufentanil-morphine. 100 nonbreastfeeding women undergoing elective cesarean delivery with sufentanil-morphine-bupivacaine anesthesia. In the ondansetron group, 38 patients had pruritus (16 mild and 22 severe) and 9 patients had nausea and vomiting (5 mild and 4 severe). The frequency and severity of the nausea and vomiting episodes were significantly reduced in the ondansetron group.</s><s>In this randomized double-blind trial we investigated the effect of acupressure on the incidence of nausea and vomiting after caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia with added intrathecal morphine. Parturients wore either acupressure or placebo wristbands during surgery and postoperatively for at least 10 h. There was no significant difference overall between the two groups in the incidence of intra- or postoperative nausea or vomiting/retching.</s><s>To evaluate the efficacy and safety of bolus dose of midazolam and metoclopramide in reducing emetic symptoms during caesarean delivery under spinal anaesthesia. The frequency of nausea and vomiting, sedative score, respiratory depression, and side effects were recorded. Sedation scores within 3 hour postoperatively were significantly lower in the metoclopramide group. Neonatal outcome was similar in the two groups and all the neonates had Apgar scores > or = 8 at one and five minutes. A bolus dose of midazolam (2 mg) was more effective than metoclopramide (10 mg) for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in parturients patients undergoing caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia, however, further studies are needed to prove the safety of midazolam in parturient patients undergoing caesarean section.</s><s>To compare the relative efficacy of prophylactic metoclopramide, ondansetron, and placebo in nonemergent cesarean section patients given epidural anesthesia intraoperatively and for the first 24-hour period after delivery. At time of umbilical cord clamp, patients received intravenously (IV) either 4 mg ondansetron (Group O) or 10 mg metoclopramide (Group M) or 10 mL normal saline (Group P). The frequency of nausea for the 24-hour study period were 26%, 51% and 71% for Groups O, M, and P respectively (p < 0.03). The frequency of intraoperative and postoperative vomiting were similar between Group O and Group M, but significantly higher in Group P (p < 0.05). In cesarean section patients given epidural anesthesia, prophylactic ondansetron, 4 mg IV, is more efficacious and has a higher patient satisfaction than that with metoclopramide, 10 mg IV, or placebo in preventing nausea and achieving complete responses during intraoperative period and the first 24-hour postdelivery period. Prophylactic ondansetron 4 mg IV is more effective in preventing nausea than vomiting.</s><s>We have tested the hypotheses that glycopyrrolate, administered immediately before induction of subarachnoid anaesthesia for elective Caesarean section, reduces the incidence and severity of nausea, with no adverse effects on neonatal Apgar scores, in a double-blind, randomized, controlled study. Fifty women received either glycopyrrolate 200 micrograms or saline (placebo) i.v. Patients in the group pretreated with glycopyrrolate reported a reduction in the frequency (P = 0.02) and severity (P = 0.03) of nausea. Glycopyrrolate also reduced the severity of hypotension, as evidenced by reduced ephedrine requirements (P = 0.02).</s><s>To determine the minimum effective dose of dexamethasone in preventing nausea and vomiting associated with epidural morphine for post-Cesarean analgesia. One hundred and eighty parturients (n=45 in each of four groups) requiring epidural morphine for post-Cesarean analgesia were enrolled in this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study. Parturients who received dexamethasone, either 10 mg or 5 mg were different from those who received saline alone in the following parameters: the total incidence of nausea and vomiting, incidence of > 4 vomiting episodes, number the of parturients requiring rescue antiemetics, and the total number of parturients with no vomiting and/or no antiemetic medication (P < 0.05 to P < 0.01). Dexamethasone, 5 mg i.v., is suggested as the minimum effective dose in preventing nausea and vomiting associated with epidural morphine for post-Cesarean analgesia.</s><s>The efficacy of ondansetron and droperidol were evaluated for prophylactic treatment of nausea and vomiting in cesarean section patients under epidural anesthesia. Forty-eight ASA physical status I-II parturients requiring nonemergent cesarean section gave their consent and were randomly assigned into one of three treatment groups (n = 16 each) according to a double-blind, placebo-controlled protocol. When the fetal umbilical cord was clamped, patients received intravenously 8 mg of ondansetron or 0.625 mg of droperidol or saline depending on their treatment group. Ninety-four percent of the ondansetron group, 88% of the droperidol group, and 56% of the placebo group were emesis free. Both prophylactic ondansetron and droperidol were similarly effective, and significantly better than placebo, in reducing the incidence and severity of intraoperative emetic symptoms in cesarean section patients under epidural anesthesia.</s><s>This prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind study was performed to evaluate the effects of ondansetron on nausea and vomiting during elective Caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia. After umbilical-cord clamping, ondansetron 4 mg or 0.9% saline was injected intravenously and the study period continued for 2 h. The severity of nausea was graded from 0 = none to 10 = maximum, while that of vomiting was graded from single = once per min to continuous = multiple per min. However, for those who experienced nausea, ondansetron reduced its severity (p = 0.05). We conclude that the intra-operative administration of 4 mg ondansetron intravenously during Caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia significantly reduces the incidence of vomiting and the severity of nausea.</s><s>In this prospective, randomized, double-blinded study, we compared the prophylactic efficacy of nalbuphine and ondansetron for the prevention of intrathecal morphine-induced pruritus after cesarean delivery. Treatment for pruritus was requested by patients in 25%, 47%, 51%, and 72% of patients in the N-4, O-4, O-8, and placebo groups, respectively (P < 0.001). There were no differences among groups in nausea/vomiting score, pain score, sedation score, or shivering score at 4, 8, and 24 h after surgery. Nalbuphine and ondansetron are more effective than placebo for the prevention of intrathecal morphine-induced pruritus after cesarean delivery.</s><s>There is a controversy regarding the best drug for prevention of nausea and vomiting in patients receiving intrathecal morphine. The aim of this study was to examine efficacy and tolerability of droperidol compared with ondansetron for the prevention of morphine-induced nausea and vomiting. Three of the 14 placebo patients (7.5%) were nauseous, compared with 4 (10%) receiving ondansetron and 5 (12.5%) receiving droperidol. Ondansetron was effective in reducing the incidence of nausea and vomiting in patients receiving intrathecal morphine for Caesarean section.</s><s>Intrathecal morphine provides good analgesia after cesarean delivery but the side effects include nausea and vomiting. The incidences of nausea and vomiting, sedative score, pain score, and side effects were recorded. Sedation scores within 3 h postoperatively and incidence of restlessness for the combination group were significantly lower than in the droperidol only group. This combination was more effective than either dexamethasone 8 mg or droperidol 1.25 mg alone in preventing nausea and vomiting after spinal anesthesia using 0.5% bupivacaine and morphine 0.2 mg.</s><s>In a randomized, double-blind study, we compared the efficacy of metoclopramide hydrochloride with that of low-dose droperidol for prevention of nausea and vomiting during and after elective cesarean section with epidural anesthesia. In one study group, 40 women received metoclopramide (15 mg); in the other group, 41 women received droperidol (0.5 mg). One woman (3%) in the metoclopramide group, versus two women (5%) in the droperidol group, had intraoperative, postdelivery vomiting (P = NS). We conclude that metoclopramide (15 mg) and droperidol (0.5 mg) were similarly effective.</s><s>Administration of metoclopramide for prevention of nausea and vomiting during epidural anesthesia for elective cesarean section.</s><s>Eighty-one consenting women undergoing elective Caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia were randomly divided into two groups. Women in the two groups were similar with respect to age, duration of use of the PCA, amount of morphine used, previous history of PONV, and incidence of motion sickness and morning sickness during the current pregnancy. The number of women who complained of nausea and those needing rescue antiemetic medication was significantly less in Group O. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the patient's perception of the control of nausea and their overall satisfaction.</s><s>Nausea and vomiting are important side effects following administration of epidural morphine for post-Cesarean section pain relief.

The sample consisted of 354 family caregivers of community dwelling hospice patients with advanced cancer. Patient/caregiver dyads were randomly divided into three groups, including a control group (n = 109) who received standard hospice care, a group (n = 109) who received standard hospice care plus three supportive visits, and a group (n = 111) who received standard care plus three visits to teach a coping skills intervention. Structured caregiver skill-training interventions for caregivers are promising even in the difficult environment of end-of-life care and for families already receiving benefits of hospice care.</s><s>The purpose of this study was to determine if patients with advanced breast cancer and their family caregivers, who participated in a family based intervention, report better quality of life and other psychosocial outcomes than dyads who received standard care alone. The intervention consisted of five sessions and addressed family involvement, optimistic attitude, coping effectiveness, uncertainty reduction, and symptom management. Intervention effects were evident at three-months, but were not sustained at six-months. Although the family intervention had positive effects initially, these effects were not sustained over time.</s>"

        "Abstracts": "<s>This article reports recent findings from a program of experimental research examining the effects of adapting judicial supervision to the risk level of drug-abusing offenders. Prior studies revealed that high-risk participants with (1) antisocial personality disorder or (2) a history of drug abuse treatment performed significantly better in drug court when they were scheduled to attend frequent, bi-weekly judicial status hearings in court. These findings yield practical information for enhancing the efficacy and cost-efficiency of drug court services. Directions for future research on adaptive programming for drug offenders are discussed.</s><s>Randomized trial evidence on the effectiveness of incarceration and treatment of first-time driving while intoxicated (DWI) offenders who are primarily American Indian has yet to be reported in the literature on DWI prevention. A randomized clinical trial was conducted, in conjunction with 28 days of incarceration, of a treatment program incorporating motivational interviewing principles for first-time DWI offenders. The sample of 305 offenders including 52 diagnosed as ASPD by the Diagnostic Interview Schedule were assessed before assignment to conditions and at 6, 12, and 24 months after discharge. Self-reported frequency of drinking and driving as well as various measures of drinking over the preceding 90 days were available at all assessments for 244 participants. Antisocial personality disorder participants reported heavier and more frequent drinking but showed significantly greater declines in drinking from intake to posttreatment assessments.</s><s>This study evaluated the psychiatric symptoms, psychosocial problems, and treatment response of personality-disordered substance abusers receiving services within a homeless drop-in center. Although rates of cluster B personality disorders were comparable to other substance dependent samples, clusters A and C disorders were disproportionately more common. However, clients with more severe personality disorder symptoms demonstrated better utilization of SAC than DFST.</s><s>A total of 480 patients were treated in a large, multicenter randomized trial of a brief form of cognitive therapy, manual-assisted cognitive behavior therapy (MACT) versus treatment as usual (TAU) for recurrent deliberate self-harm. A total of 60% of those allocated to MACT had face-to-face treatment and 430 (90%) of all patients had self-harm data recorded after 1 year. Although the results showed no significant difference between those repeating self-harm in the MACT group (39%) compared with the TAU group (46%) (P = 0.20), the treatment was cost effective (10% cheaper than TAU) and the frequency of self-harm episodes was fewer (50%) in the MACT group. A total of nine of 10 patients had some personality disturbance (42% of these with disorder), and for those where information on parasuicide events was collected, the proportion having a repeat episode ranged from 33% to 63% for different personality disorders. Those with BPD were most likely to repeat episodes quickly (mean 89 days for 25% to repeat) with dissocial personality disorder (equivalent mean 384 days) the slowest to repeat. It is concluded that MACT has value in preventing self-harm cost effectively but this appears to be confined mainly to those who do not have BPD.</s><s>Social problem-solving therapy may be relevant in the treatment of personality disorder, although assessments of its effectiveness are uncommon. To determine the effectiveness of a problem-solving intervention for adults with personality disorder in the community under conditions resembling routine clinical practice. In intention-to-treat analysis, those allocated to intervention showed significantly better problem-solving skills (P<0.001), higher overall social functioning (P=0.031) and lower anger expression (P=0.039) compared with controls. No significant differences were found on use of services during the intervention period.</s><s>We examined the effect of a case management intervention on drug treatment entry among injection drug users (IDUs) with and without comorbid antisocial personality disorder (ASPD). Injection drug users attending the Baltimore Needle Exchange Program who sought and were granted referrals to opioid agonist treatment were randomized to receive a strengths-based case management intervention or passive referral.</s><s>This study examined the relatively unexplored contribution of the therapist's performance in determining outcomes of treatment. Nine therapists were studied: three performed supportive-expressive psychotherapy; three, cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy; and three, drug counseling. The three therapist-related factors were moderately associated with each other.</s><s>Little information exists on treatment effectiveness in antisocial personality disorder (ASPD). This was an exploratory two-centre, randomized controlled trial in a community setting. At 12 months, both groups reported a decrease in the occurrence of any acts of verbal or physical aggression. Trends in the data, in favour of CBT, were noted for problematic drinking, social functioning and beliefs about others. CBT did not improve outcomes more than usual treatment for men with ASPD who are aggressive and living in the community in this exploratory study. It is feasible to carry out a rigorous randomized controlled trial in this group.</s><s>Antisocial personality disorder (APD) is associated with increased problem severity in treatment-seeking opioid-dependent patients. Treatment studies have reported mixed results but generally show that patients with APD make progress that is often comparable to drug-dependent patients without the personality disorder. Much of this work is based on secondary analyses of studies evaluating responses to a variety of drug abuse treatment interventions. Subjects in the experimental group had significantly better counseling attendance and some indication of lower psychosocial impairment compared to the control group. These findings support the development of interventions more tailored to drug-dependent patients with APD.</s><s>This study compared the efficacy of 2 approaches for the treatment of cocaine dependence among methadone-maintained patients with and without antisocial personality disorder (ASPD). The Structural Clinical Interview for Mental Disorders-IV was administered to 108 patients to assess ASPD. A 2-way analysis of variance showed that patients with ASPD were more likely to abstain from cocaine use during treatment than patients without ASPD. The strong treatment effect for ASPD patients was primarily due to the CM condition.</s>"

        "Abstracts": "<s>In a prospective controlled study, patients with incurable cancer and an estimated prognosis of three months to one year were allocated to two patient groups for evaluation of supportive interventions. Several methodologic problems were identified, which have implications for future research. Pain problems later in the course of cancer seem to be predictable in those patients with higher scores on the Cornell Medical Index M-R scales (greater emotional disturbance) and on the Rotter Locus of Control (I-E) scale (expectation of more external control of self). Such nurses can significantly improve the quality of life for patients dying outside of institutions.</s><s>A randomized clinical trial was conducted to assess the effects of home nursing care for patients with progressive lung cancer. Patients were entered into the study 2 months after diagnosis and followed for 6 months. The two home nursing care groups had less distress and greater independence 6 weeks longer than the office care group. In addition, the two home nursing care groups steadily reported worse health perceptions over time. Thus, it was remarkable that the office care group, which indicated more symptom distress and social dependency with time, also indicated perceptions of improved health with time. Home care may also include assisting patients in acknowledging the reality of their situation.</s><s>Newly diagnosed cancer patients (n=527) were randomised to intensified primary care or a control group. increased information from specialist care, education and supervision in cancer care. The aims of this paper are to evaluate the effects of intensified primary care on cancer patients' home care nurse contacts, and to study if patients' use of home care services 6 months after diagnosis can be predicted. About 90% of intensified primary care patients reported such contacts, compared to 26% of control patients. The strongest predictor of a continuing contact in the intensified primary care group was high age. The results suggest that routines like those implemented through intensified primary care may be an effective strategy to increase the accessibility and continuity of care, especially for elderly people and for patients with a need for long-term contacts.</s><s>Educational interventions, aiming to increase patients' knowledge and attitude regarding pain, can affect pain treatment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a Pain Education Programme (PEP), on adequacy of pain treatment, and to describe characteristics predicting change in adequacy. Adequacy of pain treatment was evaluated by means of the Amsterdam Pain Management Index (APMI), consisting of an integrated score of patients' Present Pain Intensity, Average Pain Intensity, and Worst Pain Intensity, corrected for patients' Tolerable Present Pain, with the analgesics used by the patient. A beneficial effect of the PEP was found for patients both with and without district nursing. The benefit from the PEP, however, decreases slightly over time, pointing at a need for ongoing education.

Randomised trial comparing discharge from hospital 4 days after surgery (with drain in situ) with discharge after drain removal (mean 9 days in hospital). Psychosocial measurements performed before surgery and 1 and 4 months after. Patient satisfaction with the short stay in hospital was high; only 4% (2/56 at 1 month after surgery and 2/52 at 4 months after surgery) of patients indicated that they would have preferred a longer stay. Before surgery, short stay patients scored higher on scales of depression (P=0.03) and after surgery they were more likely to discuss their disease with their families (at 1 month P=0.004, at 4 months P=0.04). Early discharge from hospital after surgery for breast cancer is safe and is well received by patients. Early discharge seems to enhance the opportunity for social support within the family.</s><s>To determine the effectiveness of a multicomponent clinical intervention to reduce pain in outpatients with cancer. Sixty-four patients were randomly assigned to receive either a clinical intervention including an information session, the use of a pain diary, and the possibility to contact a physician to adjust the pain medication, or the usual treatment of pain by the staff radiation oncologist. The study groups were similar with respect to their baseline characteristics and pain levels at randomization.</s><s>To examine the impact on continuity of nursing care delivered by a pivot nurse in oncology to improve symptom relief and outcomes for patients with lung or breast cancer. Three outpatient ambulatory oncology clinics in a large university health center in Quebec, Canada.Sample: 113 patients with lung cancer and 77 patients with breast cancer. Researchers found no significant differences in symptom distress, fatigue, quality of life, and healthcare usage between groups. Experienced nurses with specialized knowledge of oncology symptom assessment and management may reduce the symptom burden experienced by ambulatory patients with breast or lung cancer during active treatment.</s><s>Changes in the healthcare system have resulted in shortened hospital stays, moving the focus of care from the hospital to the home. We also assessed potential predictors of survival in terms of depressive symptoms, symptom distress, functional status, comorbidities, length of hospital stay, age of patient, and stage of disease. Discharged older cancer patients after surgery at a Comprehensive Cancer Center in southeastern Pennsylvania. Three hundred seventy-five patients aged 60 to 92, newly diagnosed with solid cancers, were treated surgically between February 1993 and December 1995. The intervention was a standardized protocol that consisted of standard assessment and management post-surgical guidelines, doses of instructional content, and schedules of contacts. The intervention lasted 4 weeks and consisted of three home visits and five telephone contacts provided by APNs. Forty-one (22%) of those who died were patients in the specialized home care intervention group, compared with 52 (28%) in the usual care group. Stage of disease at diagnosis differed between the two groups at baseline (38% late stage patients in the intervention group compared with 26% in the control group, P = .01), so stratified analysis was performed. For example, 2-year survival among late stage intervention group cases was 67% compared with 40% among control cases. This is the first empirical study of post-surgical cancer patients to link a specialized home care intervention by advanced practice nurses with improved survival. Additional research is needed to test home care interventions aimed at maintaining quality of life outcomes and their effects on survival of post-surgical cancer patients.</s><s>To evaluate the effect of telephone follow-up on the physical well-being dimension of health-related quality of life in patients with cancer. Sixty-eight percent of the follow-up group and 40% of the control group (p = 0.007) reported having had at least one contact with a health professional. We suggest that telephone follow-up be coordinated among health professionals.</s><s>Women with gynecological cancers have reported poor health-related quality of life (QOL), with complex physical and psychological needs post-surgery and during chemotherapy treatment. There are no studies reporting interventions addressing these needs post-hospital discharge in this population. The sample for the longitudinal analysis included 123 who completed QOL outcome measures across three occasions post-surgery. The APN intervention resulted in significantly less uncertainty than the attention control intervention 6 months after surgery. When the sub-group who received the APN plus PCLN intervention was compared with the total attention control group, the sub-group had significantly less uncertainty, less symptom distress, and better SF-12 mental and physical QOL over time. Nurse tailored interventions that target both physical and psychological aspects of QOL in women recovering from cancer surgery and undergoing chemotherapy produce stronger outcomes than interventions that target solely one QOL aspect.</s><s>Despite advances in the technology of cancer pain assessment and control, cancer pain often remains undertreated even in hospital settings. To determine whether a graphical display of cancer patients' pain levels might improve their treatment, the investigators conducted a randomized controlled trial. Patients assigned to the intervention group (N = 40) had periodic pain assessments by study staff, who graphically recorded their reported pain-intensity levels on bedside wall charts.</s><s>Pain and symptom management is an integral part of the clinical practice of oncology. A number of guidelines have been developed to assist the clinician in optimizing comfort care. Eighty-one cancer patients, aged 37 to 76 years, were enrolled onto a prospective, longitudinal, randomized controlled study from the outpatient clinic settings of 26 western Washington-area medical oncologists. Patients randomized to the pain algorithm group achieved a statistically significant reduction in usual pain intensity, measured as slope scores, when compared with standard community practice (P < .02). Concurrent chemotherapy and patient adherence to treatment were significant mediators of worst pain. This guideline implementation study supports the use of algorithmic decision making in the management of cancer pain.</s><s>To measure effects on terminally ill cancer patients and their families of coordinating the services available within the NHS and from local authorities and the voluntary sector. Coordination group patients received the assistance of two nurse coordinators, whose role was to ensure that patients received appropriate and well coordinated services, tailored to their individual needs and circumstances. Results from the baseline interview, the interview closest to death, and the interview after bereavement were analysed. Coordination group patients were less likely to suffer from vomiting, were more likely to report effective treatment for it, and less likely to be concerned about having an itchy skin. Their carers were more likely to report that in the last week of life the patient had had a cough and had had effective treatment for constipation, and they were less likely to rate the patient's difficulty swallowing as severe or to report effective treatment for anxiety.</s><s>Treatments for clinically localized prostate carcinoma are accompanied by sexual, urinary, and bowel dysfunction and other sequelae that can result in significant distress and reduced well being. Methods capable of improving quality of life are needed that can be integrated into clinical practice. Participants in the intervention arm met once each month for 6 months with an oncology nurse intervenor, who helped patients identify their quality-of-life needs using an interactive computer program. Primary outcome variables included 1) disease-specific quality of life, including sexual, urinary, and bowel outcomes and cancer worry; 2) depression; 3) dyadic adjustment; and 4) general quality of life. Baseline depression moderated the impact of the intervention on several other quality-of-life outcomes.</s><s>To test the effects of a computer-based nursing intervention designed to provide patients and family caregivers with concrete, objective information on symptom management; provide education about disease and treatment; coordinate medical resources; and provide emotional support and counseling. A large, urban, midwestern, tertiary-cancer center and a community-based cancer center in a medium-sized midwestern city. Outcome data were collected via structured telephone interviews at three time points: baseline, midway through the intervention, and one month postintervention. This nurse-directed intervention resulted in improved mental health for patients; however, physical subscales were not changed. Further work is needed to determine why depression and mental health were affected yet physical health and symptoms did not differ between groups. Results support the important role of nurses in addressing mental health issues in patients and families experiencing cancer.</s><s>Patients in the study group received the service immediately, those in the control group received it after one month. A city of 300,000 people with a publicly funded home care service and about 200 general practitioners, most of whom provide home care. In designing evaluations of palliative care services, investigators should be prepared to deal with the following issues: attrition due to early death, opposition to randomisation by patients and referral sources, ethical problems raised by randomisation of dying patients, the appropriate timing of comparison points, and difficulties of collecting data from sick or exhausted patients and care givers.</s><s>This paper describes an intervention study aimed at improving communication between hospital services and the primary health care team. Women newly diagnosed with breast cancer were allocated to either an intervention (n=38) or non-intervention (n=38) group. Patient interviews were carried out around the time of diagnosis and at 4 months from diagnosis. The study findings were interesting although not significant in terms of the direction anticipated. The cards did not impact on the utilization of the primary health care team and women in the intervention group were no more likely to utilize primary care sources of information than women in the non-intervention group.</s><s>To assess the effectiveness of nurse led follow up in the management of patients with lung cancer. 203 patients with lung cancer who had completed their initial treatment and were expected to survive for at least 3 months. Nurse led follow up of outpatients compared with conventional medical follow up. Outcome measures: Quality of life, patients' satisfaction, general practitioners' satisfaction, survival, symptom-free survival, progression-free survival, use of resources, and comparison of costs. Patients who received the intervention had less severe dyspnoea at 3 months (P=0.03) and had better scores for emotional functioning (P=0.03) and less peripheral neuropathy (P=0.05) at 12 months. No significant differences in general practitioners' overall satisfaction were seen between the two groups. Nurse led follow up was acceptable to lung cancer patients and general practitioners and led to positive outcomes.</s><s>Routine follow-up of breast cancer patients in specialist clinics is standard practice in most countries. Follow-up involves regularly scheduled breast cancer check-ups during the disease-free period. The aims of follow-up are to detect breast cancer recurrence and to provide psychosocial support to the patient; however, little is known about patients' views on breast cancer follow-up. Two hundred and ninety-six women with breast cancer in remission receiving regular follow-up care at two district general hospitals in England were included in the study. Patients with breast cancer were more satisfied with follow-up in general practice than in hospital outpatient departments. When discussing follow-up with breast cancer patients, they should be provided with complete and accurate information about the goals, expectations, and limitations of the follow-up programme so that they can make an informed choice.</s><s>The purpose of this study was to determine if continued access to information following a baseline pain education program would increase knowledge and positive beliefs about cancer pain management, thus resulting in improved pain control during a 6-month follow-up period. Patients with cancer-related pain and their primary caregivers received a brief pain education program, and were then randomized into one of three information groups: a) usual care, b) pain hot line, and c) weekly provider-initiated follow-up calls for 1 month post-education. Both patients and caregivers showed an improvement in knowledge and beliefs after the baseline pain education program.</s><s>Patients with breast cancer who require axillary clearance traditionally remain in hospital until their wound drains are removed. Nurse-led early discharge had no adverse effects on quality of life or patient satisfaction, had little effect on carer burden, improved communication between primary and secondary care, reduced cancellations and was safely implemented in a mixed rural/urban setting. Nonparticipants were significantly older, more likely to live alone and had lower emotional well being before surgery. This study provides further evidence of the benefits of early discharge from hospital following axillary clearance for breast cancer.</s><s>To evaluate the effect of nurse case management on the treatment of older women with breast cancer. Sixty surgeons practicing at 13 community and two public hospitals in southeast Texas. Women seeing surgeons randomized to the intervention group received the services of a nurse case manager for 12 months after the diagnosis of breast cancer. The primary outcome was the type and use of cancer-specific therapies received in the first 6 months after diagnosis. Secondary outcomes were patient satisfaction and arm function on the affected side 2 months after diagnosis. Two months after surgery, higher percentages of women in the case manager group had normal arm function (93% vs 84%; P=.037) and were more likely to state that they had a real choice in their treatment (82.2% vs 69.9%, P=.020). Nurse case management results in more appropriate management of older women with breast cancer.</s><s>General practitioners (GPs) play a critical role in the treatment of patients with cancer; yet often lack information for optimal care. Focus group work informed the development of the CT information which focused on potential adverse effects and recommended management strategies. GPs of patients due to commence CT were randomly assigned to receive usual correspondence with or without the faxed patient/regimen-specific information. Telephone questionnaire at baseline and 1 week postintervention assessed knowledge, confidence, and satisfaction. GPs in the intervention group demonstrated a significantly greater increase in confidence (mean difference, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.47) and satisfaction (mean difference, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.88) compared with usual care, reflecting a 7.1% and 10.5% difference in score, respectively. Information about CT faxed to GPs is a simple, inexpensive intervention that increases confidence managing CT adverse effects and satisfaction with shared care.</s><s>This study examined the effectiveness of giving medical oncologists immediate feedback about cancer patients' self-reported psychosocial well-being in reducing those patients' levels of anxiety, depression, perceived needs and physical symptoms. Cancer patients attending one cancer centre for their first visit were allocated to intervention (n = 42) or control (n = 38) groups. All patients completed a computerized survey assessing their psychosocial well-being while waiting to see the oncologist. A total of 48 participants (25 intervention and 23 control) completed the survey four times. Reductions in levels of anxiety, depression and perceived needs among intervention patients were not significantly different to control patients.</s><s>All admissions to a 1,100-bed Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital were screened to identify 171 terminally ill patients with informal caregivers who were then randomly assigned to VA hospital-based team home care (HBHC, N = 85) or customary care (N = 86). Patient functioning, and patient and caregiver morale and satisfaction with care were measured at baseline, one month, and six months. Those in the experimental group used 5.9 fewer VA hospital days (p = .03), resulting in a $1,639 or 47 percent per capita saving in VA hospital costs (p = .02). As a result, total per capita health care costs, including HBHC, were $769 or 18 percent (n.s.)</s><s>Over the past 20 years, both inpatient units and outpatient clinics have developed programs for geriatric evaluation and management. However, the effects of these interventions on survival and functional status remain uncertain. After their condition had been stabilized, patients were randomly assigned, according to a two-by-two factorial design, to receive either care in an inpatient geriatric unit or usual inpatient care, followed by either care at an outpatient geriatric clinic or usual outpatient care. The interventions involved teams that provided geriatric assessment and management according to Veterans Affairs standards and published guidelines. Secondary outcomes were the ability to perform activities of daily living, physical performance, utilization of health services, and costs. Neither the inpatient nor the outpatient intervention had a significant effect on mortality (21 percent at one year overall), nor were there any synergistic effects between the two interventions.</s><s>To describe a randomized trial of a cognitive behavioral intervention on reducing symptom severity among patients diagnosed with solid tumors and undergoing a first course of chemotherapy and to determine whether the intervention had an additive or interactive effect on symptom severity in the presence of supportive care medications. Patients (N = 237) were accrued from comprehensive and community cancer centers, interviewed, and randomly assigned to either the experimental intervention (n = 118) or conventional care (n = 119). A symptom severity index, based on summed severity scores across 15 symptoms, was the primary outcome. The proportion of patients not receiving chemotherapy at 10 and 20 weeks did not differ by group. At the 10- and 20-week observations, there was a significant interaction between the experimental group and baseline symptom severity. Controlling for chemotherapy treatment status at follow-up and supportive care medications did not alter the effect of the experimental intervention.</s><s>The role of the areawide oncology nurse coordinator in the home care of cancer patients.</s><s>To evaluate the use of a multidisciplinary record held by patients with cancer in the community. 501 patients under the care of the Department of Oncology, Singleton Hospital, Swansea. 1148 patients were eligible for the study; 501 were recruited (44%) and 344 completed the study (172 in each group). Fifty three percent of patients would have preferred not to have a patient held record. There was a low level of use of the record by healthcare professionals but most of those who remembered using it indicated that they would prefer patients to have it. The patient held record is valued by some patients and professionals but has no significant impact on the quality of life of patients or NHS resource use. It is recommended that it should be made available to patients on request and used by them according to need.</s><s>High experienced continuity of care in patients with cancer is associated with lower needs for care, better quality of life and better psychological outcomes. We developed and evaluated an intervention to improve experienced continuity. Multidisciplinary team meetings and oncology outpatient clinics were observed, and patients and staff were interviewed. No statistically significant differences were found in patients' experienced continuity between the trial arms, but important trends were seen in measures of needs for care in favour of those receiving the intervention. A phase III trial targeting patients with inadequate experienced continuity of care is recommended.</s><s>Australian palliative care is delivered by general practitioners (GPs) and specialist palliative care teams. We conducted a multi-centred randomised controlled trial of specialist- GP case conferences, with the GP participating by teleconference, or usual care and communication methods. The case conference group showed better maintenance of some physical and mental health measures of QoL in the 35 days before death. Case conferences between GPs and specialist palliative care services may be warranted for palliative care patients.</s><s>To examine the effect of weekly completion of a patient-held quality-of-life (QOL) diary in routine oncology practice for palliative care patients. Patients were encouraged to share the QOL information with health professionals involved in their care. Changes in QOL over time (measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung questionnaire and the Palliative Care Quality of Life Index), discussion of patient problems, and satisfaction with communication and general care were assessed at baseline and at 2 and 4 months after baseline. Analysis of QOL indicated a small but consistent difference between patients in the diary group and the standard care group. No effects were found in relation to satisfaction with care, communication, or the discussion of patient problems.</s><s>The purpose of this study was to explore the roles of continuing supportive care in increasing the social support and reducing the perceived uncertainty among women newly diagnosed with breast cancer in Taiwan. Sixty-one women younger than 60 years, newly diagnosed with breast cancer and undergoing surgery, were recruited from 2 urban teaching hospitals in northern Taiwan. The experimental group was provided with additional continuing supportive care for 3 months. With knowledge of the role that continuing-care intervention plays in social support and disease uncertainty, nurses and other healthcare professionals can continue to explore and strengthen strategies to enhance the coping ability of women with breast cancer in Taiwan.</s><s>Patient-held records may facilitate effective, coordinated care, but no randomised controlled trials of their use in cancer care have been conducted, and concerns about possible negative effects remain. It was explained to record holders that the supplementary record was intended to improve communication with health professionals and act as an aide memoire. After three months, patients' satisfaction with communication and with participation in their own care were assessed. Global health status, emotional functioning, and cognitive functioning were measured using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 questionnaire. There were no significant differences between groups in any of the outcome measures.</s><s>To examine the effects on process of care and patient well-being, of the regular collection and use of health-related quality-of-life (HRQL) data in oncology practice. In a prospective study with repeated measures involving 28 oncologists, 286 cancer patients were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (regular completion of European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer-Core Quality of Life Questionnaire version 3.0, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale on touch-screen computers in clinic and feedback of results to physicians); attention-control group (completion of questionnaires, but no feedback); or control group (no HRQL measurement in clinic before encounters). A larger proportion of intervention patients showed clinically meaningful improvement in HRQL. In the intervention patients, HRQL improvement was associated with explicit use of HRQL data (P =.016), discussion of pain, and role function (P =.046).</s><s>The study aimed to improve continuity of care for patients undergoing major gynaecological surgery, by increasing their general practitioners' contact with the hospital and providing a comprehensive discharge summary. Visits and telephone calls by GPs to hospital during their patients' admission were measured, with and without invitation and offer of payment for contact. No significant differences in patient satisfaction and confidence in future management by their GPs were found. While no statistically significant improvements in patient satisfaction or GP confidence were shown, the data suggested that GPs value contact to meet patient information needs.</s><s>To assess the impact of comprehensive palliative care on patients' quality of life. The intervention was based on cooperation between a palliative medicine unit and the community service and was compared with conventional care. During the initial 4 months of follow-up, the compliance was good (72%) and comparable among treatment groups. At later assessments and for scores that were made within 3 months before death, there was also no consistent tendency in favor of any treatment group on the main outcomes or other EORTC QLQ-C30 scales/items.</s><s>To measure the impact of telenursing on patients discharged with ostomies resulting from cancer treatment. 28 patients with cancer in two groups: traditional home health and home health plus telenursing. Recorded the number of home health and telenursing contacts, dates when ostomy self-care needs were met, supplies used, and distance traveled. Patients completed a satisfaction survey and Maklebusts Ostomy Adjustment Scale. The home health group averaged one more home health visit per patient (telenursing mean= three visits). Telenursing participants believed that telenursing made care more accessible; they preferred telemedicine rather than waiting for face-to-face visits but still believed that face-to-face visits were best.</s><s>This trial examined the optimal setting for follow-up of patients after treatment for colon cancer by either general practitioners or surgeons. In all, 203 consenting patients who had undergone potentially curative treatment for colon cancer were randomised to follow-up by general practitioners or surgeons. Follow-up guidance recommended three monthly clinical review and annual faecal occult blood tests (FOBT) and were identical in both study arms. In all, 170 patients were available for follow-up at 12 months and 157 at 24 months. General practitioners ordered more FOBTs than surgeons (rate ratio 2.4, 95% CI 1.4-4.4), whereas more colonoscopies (rate ratio 0.7, 95% CI 0.5-1.0), and ultrasounds (rate ratio 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-1.0) were undertaken in the surgeon-led group. Results suggest similar recurrence, time to detection and death rates in each group.</s><s>A randomised controlled trial was undertaken to assess the effectiveness of a hospital Palliative Care Team (PCT) on physical symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQoL); patient, family carer and primary care professional reported satisfaction with care; and health service resource use. The full package of advice and support provided by a multidisciplinary specialist PCT ('full-PCT') was compared with limited telephone advice ('telephone-PCT', the control group) in the setting of a teaching hospital trust in the SW of England. A smaller effect was seen in 'telephone-PCT'; there were no significant differences between the groups. Satisfaction with care in both groups was high and there was no significant difference between them.</s><s>To evaluate quality of life (QOL) and cost outcomes of advanced practice nurses' (APNs') interventions with women diagnosed with breast cancer. The intervention group (n = 106) received standard care plus APN interventions based on Brooten's cost-quality model and the Oncology Nursing Society's standards of advanced practice in oncology nursing QOL was measured using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy, Mishel Uncertainty in Illness Scale and Profile of Mood States at seven intervals over two years. Information about costs (charges and reimbursement) was collected through billing systems. Unmarried women and women with no family history of breast cancer benefited from nurse interventions in mood states and well-being. APN interventions improved some QOL indicators but did not raise or lower costs.</s><s>To investigate general practitioner (GP) assessment of a structured oncology information pack sent to GPs when newly referred patients had visited a department of oncology for the first time, and to compare their assessment of this material with their assessment of traditional information provided by the department. GP assessment of the quality of the information material received for each patient.</s><s>To determine whether making patient-reported cancer needs, quality-of-life (QOL), and psychosocial information available to the health care team, allowing coordinated specifically targeted psychosocial interventions, resulted in reduced cancer needs, improved QOL, and increased satisfaction with care received. For a randomly chosen two thirds, this information was made available to the health care team who coordinated targeted psychosocial interventions. There were no significant differences between the two arms with respect to changes in cancer needs, QOL, or psychosocial functioning between the baseline and follow-up assessments, nor with respect to satisfaction with care. However, for the subgroup of patients who were moderately or severely depressed at baseline, there was a significant reduction in depression for the intervention arm relative to the control arm at the 6-month assessment (P =.001).</s><s>To determine the effectiveness of a clinical-practice intervention in improving the control of pain in outpatients with cancer. This summary was not available for the oncologists treating the patients in the control group. The groups were similar with respect to demographics, cancer sites, and performance status. A significant difference (p = .0162) in the physicians' prescription patterns was found. In the control group, prescriptions for 86% of the patients did not change, with no decrease in analgesic prescriptions; for 14% of the patients analgesic prescriptions increased. In the intervention group, analgesic prescriptions changed for 25% of the patients, decreasing for 5% and increasing for 20%. Future studies should focus on the long-term systematic incorporation of simple pain-assessment tools into daily outpatient oncology practices as well as on innovative ways to address other aspects of managing cancer pain.</s><s>The purpose of this randomized, controlled, home care intervention was to test the effectiveness of two nurse-targeted, e-mail-based interventions to increase home care nurses' adherence to pain assessment and management guidelines, and to improve patient outcomes. Nurses from a large urban non-profit home care organization were assigned to usual care or one of two interventions upon identification of an eligible cancer patient with pain. The augmented intervention supplemented the initial e-mail reminder with provider prompts, patient education material, and clinical nurse specialist outreach. Over 300 nurses were randomized and outcomes of 673 of their patients were reviewed. Patients in the augmented group improved significantly over the control group in ratings of pain intensity at its worst, whereas patients in the basic group had better ratings of pain intensity on average. Our findings suggest that although reminders have some role in improving cancer pain management, a more intensive approach is needed for a generalized nursing workforce with limited recent exposure to state-of-the-art pain management practices.</s>"

        "Abstracts": "<s>This pilot study was performed to determine the prevalence of dental fluorosis and the association between fluorosis and a number of risk factors in a group of second grade students in a rural, non-fluoridated area of Ontario, Canada. The prevalence of fluorosis in respondents was 23.3%, with 4.9% scoring TSIF of 2 or more. These included: water fluoride concentration, breast-feeding duration, professionally applied topical fluoride, fluoride supplement use, bottle-feeding, fluoridated mouthwash use, and early parental toothbrushing with toothpaste. These findings indicate that fluorosis is an important concern in non-fluoridated areas. Fluoride supplements should not be recommended unless an independent home water test is performed. Breast-feeding for 6 months or more may protect children from developing dental fluorosis in the permanent incisors.</s><s>To compare prevalence of dental fluorosis (DF) in permanent teeth in children whose domestic water supply was fluoridated since birth with that in a community where fluoridated salt was available. In Dublin 11.7% of the whole sample had a 'Questionable' level of DF, 9.8% had 'Very Mild', 3.7% had 'Mild' and 0.3% had 'Moderate' fluorosis. The corresponding percentages in Freiburg for all children were 10.9%, 4.0%, 3.4% and 0%. The results suggest that children in Dublin started brushing their teeth at an older age than in Freiburg, but no difference in DF levels was found between 'early' and 'late' users. Fisher's test revealed that the difference in DF levels between the two populations was statistically significant (p=0.03). However, the prevalence of 'Very Mild' fluorosis was twice as frequent in Dublin than in Freiburg.</s><s>Fluoride dentifrice is a primary means of preventing childhood caries, but it is also an important risk factor for fluorosis. The authors examine the influence of fluoride dentifrice ingestion on fluorosis of the permanent incisors. Participants in the Iowa Fluoride Study received questionnaires at regular intervals concerning fluoride sources. They estimated daily fluoride ingestion from dentifrice, diet and fluoride supplements and divided the amount by kilograms of body weight. Parents should supervise young children as they brush their teeth with fluoride dentifrice.</s><s>To determine the prevalence and severity of dental fluorosis in children aged 7-9 years from non-water-fluoridated Halmstad, Sweden, and to relate the results to their reported fluoride exposure history during infancy. In Spring 2002, a questionnaire distributed to a cluster random sample of 1039 parents enquired into their child's early oral health behaviors and included a \"photographic toothpaste menu\". While there were low levels of dental fluorosis of esthetic concern, half the children had some degree of dental fluorosis.</s><s>This study compared fluorosis in the upper central incisors of children from socially diverse backgrounds who had received either 440- or 1,450-ppm F toothpaste from 12 months of age. The children were resident in non-fluoridated districts in the north-west of England. They received either 440- or 1,450-ppm F toothpaste and advice regarding its use until the age of 5-6 years. In the less deprived districts the prevalences of fluorosis (TF >or=0) for the 1,450- and 440-ppm F groups were 34.5 and 23.7% (p = 0.006). In the deprived districts the prevalences of fluorosis were 25.2 and 19.5% (p = 0.2). High fluoride (1,450 ppm F) toothpastes should not be provided on a community basis to very young children in less deprived communities.</s><s>To determine the prevalence and severity of fluorosis in permanent incisor teeth in young children in a fluoridated and a fluoride-deficient community and to establish what relationship, if any, there was between the occurrence of dental fluorosis and the reported use of fluoride toothpaste in childhood. A prevalence study of children aged 8-9 years who had been continuous residents in fluoridated Newcastle or fluoride-deficient Northumberland. The permanent maxillary central incisor teeth were examined clinically and photographically by one examiner using the Thylstrup-Fejerskov index; the photographs were read blind to child identity and clinical score. A closed-response questionnaire enquired into the child's early experiences of toothbrushing and use of fluoride toothpastes. The prevalence of fluorosis was 54% in the fluoridated area and 23% in the fluoride-deficient area when all grades (> 0) of fluorosis were included; percentage prevalence of mild to moderate fluorosis (> or = 3) was 3% and 0.5% in the two areas, respectively. The prevalence of aesthetically important dental fluorosis was low, although higher in the fluoridated area.</s><s>To examine levels of fluorosis among children in two Canadian communities exposed to fluoride. Children who began brushing with fluoride toothpaste between their first and second birthdays had higher TFI scores than those who began between their second and third birthdays, regardless of daily brushing frequency. Children who regularly used supplements had higher TFI scores than those who did not. Children with a college-educated father had higher TFI scores than those whose fathers had less education. Higher fluoride exposure slightly increased the likelihood that a child had a higher TFI score, especially when more fluoridation technologies were used at home.</s><s>A recent clinical trial investigated the cariostatic effectiveness of a low (550 ppm) fluoride toothpaste in comparison with a standard (1050 ppm) control paste in pre-school children who were 2-years-old at the start of the 3-year trial. The present study has investigated the prevalence of enamel opacities in permanent incisor teeth and of caries in children who had taken part. Differences between the groups were small in real terms but using the TF index the child and tooth prevalence of opacities were significantly lower in the children who had used the test paste with a lower fluoride content; the same trend was seen in diffuse defects scored using the modified DDE index.</s><s>The purpose of this case-control investigation was to investigate the possible association between mild-to-moderate enamel fluorosis and exposure during early childhood to infant formula, fluoride toothpaste, and/or fluoride supplements. Analysis was performed on 401 residents of fluoridated communities in Connecticut, who were 12-16 years old and born prior to 1980. Risk factor exposure was ascertained via a mailed questionnaire with a response rate of 89% and a questionnaire reliability of 87%.</s><s>The purpose of this case-control investigation was to investigate the possible association between mild-to-moderate enamel fluorosis and exposure during early childhood to fluoride supplements, fluoride toothpaste, and/or infant formula use in nonfluoridated communities. Analysis was performed on 460 10- to 13-year-old children, born after 1979, who were residents of six nonfluoridated communities in Massachusetts and Connecticut. Risk factor exposure was ascertained via a mailed questionnaire with a response rate of 90% and a questionnaire reliability of 87%. Logistic regression analyses revealed a moderate association between mild-to-moderate enamel fluorosis on early forming (FRI classification I) enamel surfaces and both fluoride supplement use (odds ratio (OR) = 2.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-4.69) and early toothbrushing habits (OR = 2.56, 95% CI 1.34-4.88).</s><s>This study relates the prevalence of caries and fluorosis among Michigan children, residing in four different areas, to the various concentrations of F in the communities' water supplies. Demographic information, details of F history, and dental attendance data were collected by a questionnaire form filled out by parents. About 36% of all children had dental fluorosis, ranging from 12.2 in Cadillac to 51.2 in Richmond (1.2 ppm). The odds of experiencing fluorosis increased at every F level above the baseline (Cadillac), with the use of topical F rinses, and with age. Results suggest that children in the four communities may be ingesting a similar level of F from sources such as dentifrices, dietary supplements, and professional applications, but the factor that differentiates them with respect to the prevalence of caries and fluorosis is the F concentration in the community water supply.</s><s>This case-control study investigated risk factors for enamel fluorosis in optimally fluoridated children, born after the US infant formula industry voluntarily reduced the fluoride content of their products. Logistic regression analyses revealed a strong association between mild-to-moderate enamel fluorosis on early forming (FRI classification I) enamel surfaces and both fluoride supplement use (odds ratio (OR)=5.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06-33.53), and early fluoride toothpaste use (OR=6.35, 95% CI 1.21-33.40). No association was observed between the use of ready to feed infant formula and enamel fluorosis.</s><s>To determine the prevalence and severity of dental fluorosis, and to evaluate supplementary fluoride sources as potential risk factors to fluorosis in school children aged 6-9. Fluorosis prevalence was 56.3%, with very mild fluorosis present in 45% of children, mild in 10%, and severe in just 1.3%. Fluorosis prevalence was high for mild modalities, and low for more severe levels. According to FCI the dental fluorosis constitute a public health problem in the studied sample. Exposure to diverse fluoride sources -above and beyond the fluoridated salt program- was a risk factor for dental fluorosis in this community. Results suggest that toothpaste use in children two years of age and younger should be cautious, limited to follow current guidelines, and supervised by parents to minimize the risk of dental fluorosis.</s><s>In 1989/90, in 659 12-year-olds in Perth (F 0.8 mg/L) and the Bunbury region of Western Australia (WA) (F approximately 0.25 mg/L), dental fluorosis prevalences were 40.2% and 33.0%. Fluoride supplements (OR 4.63) and extended residence in a fluoridated area (OR 4.06) were significant risk factors; toothpaste ingestion variables had ORs greater than unity; in 1990, DMFT for this age group was 0.84. School Dental Service took steps to discourage supplement and toothpaste ingestion and to promote low fluoride toothpaste for children < 6 years of age. In 1989/90, 79 children had used supplements before the age of 4 year; in 2000 only 40 had done so (P < 0.001).</s><s>In Norway, there is no water fluoridation and little naturally occurring fluoride in drinking water. Fluoride toothpaste is used by 95% of the population and there is a long tradition of fluoride supplement use. All children (n = 551, born 1988) in a municipality in Norway were invited to participate. Sixty-seven percent of the children had used fluoride supplements regularly during childhood. At 8 months or earlier, the teeth of 26% of the children, and at age 14 months or earlier the teeth of 82%, were being brushed. Bivariate and multivariate analyses showed that, in addition to use of fluoride supplements, starting toothbrushing at an early age was associated with higher prevalence of dental fluorosis.</s><s>This study investigated the potential association between fluoride exposure and behavior problems in children, as well as the prevalence of and risk factors for fluorosis. Using a summation of the Modified Dean's index (Sum of 8), we divided the children into high fluorosis (HF) and low fluorosis (LF) groups. These groups were compared to each other with respect to fluoride exposures and behavior. Although there was no association between the fluoride exposures in aggregate and fluorosis, there was a significant association between supplemental fluoride exposure from ages 0-3 years and fluorosis. There was no association between behavior problems and dental fluorosis in this population.</s><s>The use of fluoride involves a balance between protection against dental caries and risk of dental fluorosis. To evaluate the effectiveness of policy measures in reducing the prevalence of fluorosis among Australian children. A random sample of South Australian children born in 1989-1994 was selected in 2002/2003, stratified by fluoridation status and urban/rural residence. Case definitions of fluorosis were: having a TF score of 1+ (TF1+) or a TF score of 2+ (TF2+) on one or both maxillary central incisors. Results: A higher proportion of children in the later birth cohorts used low-concentration fluoridated toothpaste, and a smaller amount of toothpaste was used when they commenced toothbrushing. There was a significant decline in the prevalence of fluorosis across the three successive birth cohorts. The experience of fluorosis among the South Australian child population was mostly very mild to mild.</s><s>Swallowed fluoride toothpaste in the early years of life has been postulated to be a risk factor for fluorosis, but the epidemiological evidence is weakened by the fact that most of the relevant studies were done in developed countries where an individual is exposed to multiple sources of fluoride. Case-control analyses were conducted to test the hypothesis that fluoride toothpaste use before the age of 6 years increased an individual's risk of fluorosis. Data came from a cross-sectional clinical dental examination of schoolchildren and a self-administered questionnaire to their parents. The study group consisted of 1189 seventh grade children with a mean age of 12.2 years.</s><s>Mild dental fluorosis is frequently linked to fluoridated water, but discretionary fluoride sources may also be important. The aim of this study was to record age of weaning and fluoride exposure from water, toothpaste and supplements, and to relate these to the presence of caries and fluorosis in children born in 1983. Mean age of weaning of those who had been breast-fed was 7.7 months; by 9 months, 74% had been weaned. Eighty-five percent liked toothpaste, 60.7% had swallowed it, and the mean age of starting to use it was 1.5 (SD 0.96) years. Residence in a fluoridated area for > or = 2.5 of the first 4 years of life had an odds ratio (OR) of 4.9 for fluorosis. Major risk factors for more severe fluorosis (TF > or = 2) were early weaning and swallowing toothpaste (ORs 2.77 and 2.64, respectively).</s><s>Concerns have been raised recently about whether a substantial amount of dental fluorosis is resulting from the increased use of fluoride from various sources. The purposes of this study were to determine the prevalence and severity of dental fluorosis in a sample of pediatric patients seeking dental treatment in a university pediatric dental clinic and to evaluate sources of fluoride as risk factors for dental fluorosis. Fluoride exposures were compared among 54 cases and 54 matched controls using a case-control retrospective design. Fluorosis was found in 72 percent of the children, but was generally quite mild. The results suggest prudent use of dentifrice by young children to minimize the risk of fluorosis.</s><s>The main purpose of this study is to compare data from previous surveys to current prevalence rates of dental caries and dental fluorosis in eleven- and twelve-year-olds in a non-fluoridated Brazilian community (< 0.2 ppm F). The sample subjects are randomly selected schoolchildren who were examined with a dental probe and buccal mirror under natural light. The intra-examiner error was calculated, using Kappa statistics (K tau 0.85). Children with dental fluorosis were 1.75 times more likely to be free of caries (OR = 1.75-CI:0.43, 6.68). Children who started using fluoride toothpaste before the age of three were 4.43 times more likely to have dental fluorosis than those who started using it after the age of three (OR = 4.43-CI:0.51, 99.61).</s><s>We conducted a case-control study to determine the sources of fluoride which are particular risk factors to dental fluorosis. Cases and non-cases were identified by the screening of 8-, 9-, and 10-year-old schoolchildren in the fluoridated community of East York, Ontario. Parents were interviewed about the child's first five years of residence and about diet and preventive caries practices. The Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio and associated chi-square tests were used to assess the association of fluorosis with several potential sources, controlling for other sources of fluoride and mother's education. We estimate that these factors were responsible for 72% and 22%, respectively, of the cases in our population.</s><s>Eight hundred fifty 11- to 14-year-old residents of nonfluoridated communities in Massachusetts and Connecticut, who were born between 1972 and 1975, were investigated in a case-control study of the possible association between enamel fluorosis and exposure to fluoride supplements, infant formula, and/or fluoride dentifrice. The effect of median household income, an indicator of socioeconomic status, was also examined. Risk factor exposure was assessed via a mailed questionnaire with a response rate of 80%. Subjects in the middle median household income group who had used fluoride supplements through the first six years of life had a 28-fold increase in the risk of fluorosis compared with unexposed subjects in the lower median household income group.</s><s>As part of an epidemiological study on the oral health of Flemish schoolchildren, fluoride use was studied together with risk factors (medical history, tap water fluoride concentration, use of fluoride supplements, toothpaste and brushing habits). Fluorosis was scored according to the Thylstrup-Fejerskov index (TFI) in children aged 11 years (4,128 children examined). At 11 years, 92% of the children used a fluoride-containing toothpaste and 6% still received systemic fluoride supplements. Fluorosis was present in about 10% of all the children examined, mainly TFI score 1 (7.3% in upper central incisors).</s><s>To examine a possible relationship between reported toothbrushing habits in infancy and fluorosis of permanent maxillary incisors at age 8-9 years. Five primary schools in the City of Birmingham where the water is fluoridated at 1.0 mg F/l. Results of clinical examinations were compared with historical data collected via parental questionnaires. Information concerning toothbrushing habits in infancy was obtained via a questionnaire to parents who were also asked to add paste to a brush in a similar way to when the children were small. Highly significant associations were found between estimated fluoride ingestion from toothpaste and fluorosis. The prevalence of fluorosis among children in ACORN group A-C was significantly greater than in groups D-F.</s>"

To our knowledge, this is the first study of this kind where the possible benefits of surface heparinization of the VVBP circuit in OLT have been investigated. Twenty patients were randomized to either heparin-coated (HC) VVBP equipment or to otherwise identical noncoated (NC) circuits. Five blood samples were drawn during the OLT procedure: one just before VVBP, three during VVBP and one 5 min after portal venous reperfusion (PVR).</s><s>Although venovenous bypass (VVBP) has been suggested to protect the kidneys during liver transplantation and its systematic use has therefore been recommended, this beneficial effect of VVBP has not been clearly demonstrated. Both groups were similar in relation to preoperative clinical and laboratory data and operative transfusion requirements. However, renal function on the 7th postoperative day and the need for hemodialysis/ hemofiltration during the 1st week were similar in both groups. Among 40 variables analyzed, only low mean arterial pressure at anesthesia induction was identified as an independent predictor for early postoperative severe renal failure (inulin clearance < 10 mL/min/1.73 m(2) at the 24th postoperative hour), with no significant relationship between this complication and the use of venovenous bypass. Renal function markedly deteriorates during liver transplantation, and renal impairment persists during the early postoperative period.

This study analyses the effectiveness of this intervention in terms of clinical and functional status, quality of life, lifestyle, and self-management, under the hypothesis that changes in these factors could explain the observed reduction in readmissions. The intervention consisted of an individually tailored care plan at discharge shared with the primary care team and access to a specialized case manager nurse through a web-based call centre. After 1 year of intervention, subjects in the intervention group improved body mass index by 1.34 kg/m(2). There were no differences in the evolution of dyspnea, lung function, quality of life scores, lifestyle factors, or medical treatment.</s><s>People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) continue to experience dyspnea with activities of daily living (ADL) despite optimal medical management. The content of the two programs was similar, focusing on education, skills training, and ongoing support for dyspnea self-management, including independent exercise. Participants returned to one of two academic clinical sites for evaluation at 3 and 6 months. A satisfaction survey was administered and a semistructured exit interview was conducted at the final visit. The study was stopped early due to multiple technical challenges with the eDSMP, but follow-up was completed on all enrolled participants. Data were available for 39 participants who completed the study (female: 44%; age: 69.5 +/- 8.5 years; percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s: 49.6 +/- 17.0%). Self-reported endurance exercise time (P = .001), physical functioning (P = .04), and self-efficacy for managing dyspnea (P = .02) also showed positive improvements over time in both groups with no significant differences with respect to program modality. Participants who completed the study reported favorable satisfaction with the programs. Our findings will need to be confirmed in a larger randomized trial with more mature Web and personal digital assistant tools, use of a control group, and longer follow-up.</s><s>Information and telecommunication technologies are called to play a major role in the changes that healthcare systems have to face to cope with chronic disease. To determine the impact on health, the chronic care telemedicine system was used during one year (2002) with 157 COPD patients in a clinical experiment; endpoints were readmissions and mortality. Results suggest that integrated home telemedicine services can support health professionals caring for patients with chronic disease, and improve their health. We have found that simple telemedicine services (ubiquitous access to ECPR, ECPR shared by care team, accessibility to case manager, problem reporting integrated in ECPR) can increase the number of patients that were not readmitted (51% intervention, 33% control), are acceptable to professionals, and involve low installation and exploitation costs. Further research is needed to determine the role of telemonitoring and televisit services for this kind of patients.</s><s>Patient outcomes and cost were compared when home healthcare was delivered by telemedicine or by traditional means for patients receiving skilled nursing care at home. The first group, control group C, received traditional skilled nursing care at home. The third group, monitoring intervention group M, received traditional skilled nursing care at home, virtual visits using videoconferencing technology, and physiologic monitoring for their underlying chronic condition. Discharge to a higher level of care (hospital, nursing home) within 6 months of study participation was 42% for C subjects, 21% for V subjects, and 15% for M subjects. Morbidity, as evaluated by changes in the knowledge, behavior and status scales of the Omaha Assessment Tool, showed no differences between groups except for increased scores for activities of daily living at study discharge in the V and M groups.</s><s>The aim of this study was to demonstrate that telehomecare linking homebound patients with their home health-care nurses over the plain old telephone system (POTS) provides high-quality, clinically useful, and patient satisfactory interactions. Virtual visits (VVs), consisting of two-way audio and video interactions between the central site HHC nurse and the subject at home, were compared for technical quality and clinical usefulness by the HHC nurses who performed the VVs. All subjects were satisfied with their HHC; satisfaction increased with an increasing level of telehomecare intervention. These programs can provide timely and quality home health nursing care with VVs augmenting traditional home visits.</s><s>Hospital admissions due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations have a major impact on the disease evolution and costs. The current authors postulated that a simple and well-standardised, low-intensity integrated care intervention can be effective to prevent such hospitalisations. Therefore, 155 exacerbated COPD patients (17% females) were recruited after hospital discharge from centres in Barcelona (Spain) and Leuven (Belgium). They were randomly assigned to either integrated care (IC; n = 65; age mean+/-sd 70+/-9 yrs; forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)) 1.1+/-0.5 L, 43% predicted) or usual care (UC; n = 90; age 72+/-9 yrs; FEV(1) 1.1+/-0.05 L, 41% pred).</s><s>Self-management interventions improve various outcomes for many chronic diseases. The definite place of self-management in the care of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has not been established. A multicenter, randomized clinical trial was carried out in 7 hospitals from February 1998 to July 1999. All patients had advanced COPD with at least 1 hospitalization for exacerbation in the previous year. Hospital admissions for exacerbation of COPD were reduced by 39.8% in the intervention group compared with the usual care group (P =.01), and admissions for other health problems were reduced by 57.1% (P =.01).</s><s>Level of acuity and number of referrals for home health care have been escalating exponentially. Home health department in the Sacramento, Calif, facility of a large health maintenance organization. Newly referred patients diagnosed as having congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cerebral vascular accident, cancer, diabetes, anxiety, or need for wound care were eligible for random assignment to intervention (n = 102) or control (n = 110) groups. The control and intervention groups received routine home health care (home visits and telephone contact). The intervention group also had access to a remote video system that allowed nurses and patients to interact in real time. Although the average direct cost for home health services was $1830 in the intervention group and $1167 in the control group, the total mean costs of care, excluding home health care costs, were $1948 in the intervention group and $2674 in the control group. Remote video technology in the home health care setting was shown to be effective, well received by patients, capable of maintaining quality of care, and to have the potential for cost savings. Remote technology has the potential to effect cost savings when used to substitute some in-person visits and can also improve access to home health care staff for patients and caregivers.</s><s>We evaluated the use of home telehealth for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and/or congestive heart failure (CHF). In the experimental group, patient perceptions of the home telecare services were collected via telephone interviews. In regard to patient perceptions of home telecare, patients were satisfied with the technology and the way that care was delivered via this modality.</s><s>This pilot clinical investigation was conducted to compare a home therapeutic drug-monitoring (TDM) method for theophylline blood levels and a traditional TDM method with respect to various patient outcome factors. Patients in the former group monitored their serum theophylline levels at home over 6 months. Patients in both groups completed survey instruments, including questionnaires, visual analog scales, and other psychosocial measures, at designated times throughout the study period. Pulmonary function tests and dyspnea index scores were evaluated at each clinic visit. Other indicators that showed a trend toward more favorable outcomes in the home TDM group included symptomology, percentage of levels within the therapeutic range, patient attitudes regarding participation in health care management, and pulmonary function test results. The utility of a home TDM method for theophylline has not been reported previously despite potential for broad applications.</s><s>This paper reports a study to determine whether a nurse-initiated telephone follow-up programme could increase patients' self-efficacy in managing dyspnoea and decrease health care service use. Because of the fear of activity-induced dyspnoea, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease lack the confidence to perform daily activities. Studies of cardiac and diabetic patients have shown that telephone follow-up care is an effective approach to increasing self-efficacy. A total of 60 participants (30 telephone follow-up, 30 control) with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were recruited from an acute care hospital in Hong Kong. Nurse-initiated telephone follow-up care was effective in increasing self-efficacy in managing dyspnoea. The study needs to be replicated in other setting to strengthen its external validity.</s><s>Chronic respiratory patients requiring oxygen or home mechanical ventilation experience frequent exacerbations and hospitalisations with related costs. The aim of the present study was to primarily evaluate reduction in hospitalisations and, secondly, exacerbations, general practitioner (GP) calls and related cost-effectiveness of tele-assistance (TA) for these patients. A total of 240 patients (101 with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)) were randomised to two groups: an intervention group entered a 1-yr TA programme while controls received traditional care. Only COPD patients, as a separate group, had fewer hospitalisations, emergency room admissions, urgent GP calls or exacerbations.</s>"

Thirty-eight post-MI depressed patients were randomized to receive either sertraline 50 mg per day or placebo for 6 months. Depression was defined as a score >15 on the standardized Inventory to Diagnose Depression questionnaire taken at prehospital discharge and again within 2 weeks of the acute infarct. There was a linear rate of increase in the SD of 24-hour N-N intervals (SDNN) in the sertraline-treated group that paralleled that of the nondepressed reference group. However, the short-term power spectral indices, while trending toward a more rapid rate of recovery in the treated group, did not reach statistical significance compared with the placebo group. In depressed patients who have survived the acute phase of an MI sertraline facilitates the rate of recovery of SDNN, a recognized predictor of clinical outcome.</s><s>Depression and hostility are significant risk factors for mortality and morbidity after myocardial infarction (MI). Fifty-four patients with major depression after MI were randomly assigned to receive a flexible-dose regimen of fluoxetine or placebo for the first 9 weeks of a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. However, the response rate among patients receiving fluoxetine was significantly greater than that among patients receiving placebo at week 25 (48 vs. 26%, p = .05). Among patients with mild depression (HAMD-17 score < or =21), HAMD-17 scores were significantly different (p < .05) between the fluoxetine and placebo groups at weeks 9 (by 5.4 points) and 25 (by 5.8 points). Conclusions: Although the overall difference between the fluoxetine and placebo groups was not significant, there was a trend favoring fluoxetine in this relatively small sample. The response rate in the group receiving fluoxetine was comparable with that observed in other studies of patients with cardiovascular disease. In addition, fluoxetine seemed to be particularly effective in patients with mild depression and was associated with a statistically significant reduction in hostility. The results of this study suggest that fluoxetine can be safely used to treat patients with post-MI depression beginning 3 months after the event.</s>"

Median survival, based on intention-to-treat, was 17 months for multimodal therapy vs. 12 months for surgery alone (P=0.002).</s><s>A regimen of epirubicin, cisplatin, and infused fluorouracil (ECF) improves survival among patients with incurable locally advanced or metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma. We randomly assigned patients with resectable adenocarcinoma of the stomach, esophagogastric junction, or lower esophagus to either perioperative chemotherapy and surgery (250 patients) or surgery alone (253 patients). ECF-related adverse effects were similar to those previously reported among patients with advanced gastric cancer. Rates of postoperative complications were similar in the perioperative-chemotherapy group and the surgery group (46 percent and 45 percent, respectively), as were the numbers of deaths within 30 days after surgery. In patients with operable gastric or lower esophageal adenocarcinomas, a perioperative regimen of ECF decreased tumor size and stage and significantly improved progression-free and overall survival. (Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN93793971 [controlled-trials.com].).</s><s>To study the apoptosis induced by preoperative oral 5'-DFUR administration in gastric adenocarcinoma and its mechanism of action. Sixty gastric cancer patients were divided randomly into three groups (20 each group) before operation: group one:5'-DFUR oral administration at the dose of 800-1200 mg/d for 3 - 5 d, group two: 500 mg 5-FU + 200 mg/d CF by venous drip for 3 - 5 d,group three (control group). Fifty-four patients received gastrectomy, including 12 palliative resections and 42 radical resections. Finally 18 cases in 5'-DFUR group, 16 cases in CF+5-FU group, and 20 cases in control group were analyzed. However,the PCNA index (PI) in 5'-DFUR group (40.51+/-12.62) and 5-FU+CF group (41.12+/-15.26) was significantly lower than that in control group (58.33+/-15.69) (F=9.083, P=0.000). The expression rate of FasL in 5'-DFUR group was significantly lower than that in the other two groups (chi2=6.708, P=0.035). Preoperative oral 5'-DFUR administration may induce apoptosis of gastric carcinoma cells and decrease tumor cell proliferation index,but cannot improve the prognosis of patients with gastric cancer.Down-regulation of FasL and PD-ECGF expression mediated by 5'-DFUR may be one of its anti-cancer mechanisms.Fas expression correlates with the progression of gastric carcinoma and may be an effective prognostic factor.</s><s>OEO2 is a randomized, controlled trial of preoperative chemotherapy in patients undergoing radical surgery for esophageal cancer. Survival has been determined from Kaplan-Meier curves and treatment comparisons made with the log-rank test. The first disease-free survival event was macroscopic residual disease from incomplete resection (R2) or no resection in 26.4% of the S group versus 14.3% of the CS P < .001. Three-year survival by type of resection was R0 42.4%, R1 was 18.0%, and R2 was 8.6%.</s><s>Resection remains the best treatment for carcinoma of the oesophagus in terms of local control, but local recurrence and distant metastasis remain an issue after surgery. We aimed to assess whether a short preoperative chemoradiotherapy regimen improves outcomes for patients with resectable oesophageal cancer. 128 patients were randomly assigned to surgery alone and 128 patients to surgery after 80 mg/m(2) cisplatin on day 1, 800 mg/m(2) fluorouracil on days 1-4, with concurrent radiotherapy of 35 Gy given in 15 fractions. Subgroup analysis showed that patients with squamous-cell tumours had better progression-free survival with chemoradiotherapy than did those with non-squamous tumours (HR 0.47 [0.25-0.86] vs 1.02 [0.72-1.44]). However, the trial was underpowered to determine the real magnitude of benefit in this subgroup.</s><s>Patients with locally advanced gastric cancer benefit from combined pre- and postoperative chemotherapy, although fewer than 50% could receive postoperative chemotherapy. This trial was stopped for poor accrual after 144 patients were randomly assigned (72:72); 52.8% patients had tumors located in the proximal third of the stomach, including AEG type II and III. The International Union Against Cancer R0 resection rate was 81.9% after neoadjuvant chemotherapy as compared with 66.7% with surgery alone (P = .036). After a median follow-up of 4.4 years and 67 deaths, a survival benefit could not be shown (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.35; P = .466). This trial showed a significantly increased R0 resection rate but failed to demonstrate a survival benefit.</s><s>The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of preoperative chemotherapy with fluorouracili polyphase liposome composita pro orale (FPLC) on the tumour cells and the survival rate of the patients with gastric cardia cancer. Sixty patients with gastric cardia cancer were randomly divided into two groups. Pathological responses of the tumours to the FPLC chemotherapy were determined by gross and microscopic assessments of tumour size, tumour emboli, cell degeneration and necrosis. The postoperative 5-year survival rate was 40% in the FPLC-treated group and 23% in the controls (p=0.17).</s><s>The primary treatment modality for patients with carcinoma of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction has been surgery, although primary radiation therapy with concurrent chemotherapy produces similar results. As both have curative potential, there has been great interest in the use of trimodality therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to either esophagectomy with node dissection alone or cisplatin 100 mg/m(2) and fluorouracil 1,000 mg/m(2)/d for 4 days on weeks 1 and 5 concurrent with radiation therapy (50.4 Gy total: 1.8 Gy/fraction over 5.6 weeks) followed by esophagectomy with node dissection. Thirty patients were randomly assigned to trimodality therapy and 26 were assigned to surgery alone. Five-year survival was 39% (95% CI, 21% to 57%) v 16% (95% CI, 5% to 33%) in favor of trimodality therapy.</s><s>We update Radiation Therapy Oncology Group trial 8911 (USA Intergroup 113), a comparison of chemotherapy plus surgery versus surgery alone for patients with localized esophageal cancer. The relationship between resection type and between tumor response and outcome were also analyzed. Outcome based on the type of resection (R0, R1, R2, or no resection) was evaluated. Two hundred sixteen patients received preoperative chemotherapy, 227 underwent immediate surgery. Fifty-nine percent of surgery only and 63% of chemotherapy plus surgery patients underwent R0 resections (P = .5137). While, as initially reported, there was no difference in overall survival for patients receiving perioperative chemotherapy compared with the surgery only group, patients with objective tumor regression after preoperative chemotherapy had improved survival.</s><s>A pilot study of 43 patients with potentially resectable esophageal carcinoma treated with an intensive regimen of preoperative chemoradiation with cisplatin, fluorouracil, and vinblastine before surgery showed a median survival of 29 months in comparison with the 12-month median survival of 100 historical controls treated with surgery alone at the same institution. We designed a randomized trial to compare survival for patients treated with this preoperative chemoradiation regimen versus surgery alone. Radiotherapy consisted of 1.5-Gy fractions twice daily, Monday through Friday over 21 days, to a total dose of 45 Gy. Transhiatal esophagectomy with a cervical esophagogastric anastomosis was performed on approximately day 42.</s>"

        "Abstracts": "<s>To investigate the relative effectiveness of three manual treatments and back school for patients with subacute low back pain. Literature comparing the relative effectiveness of specific therapies for low back pain is limited. These patients received assessments at baseline, after 3 weeks of therapy, and 6 months after the completion of therapy. No statistically significant between-group differences were found either at the 3-week or 6-month reassessments. For subacute low back pain, combined joint manipulation and myofascial therapy was as effective as joint manipulation or myofascial therapy alone.</s><s>Chiropractic manipulation and strenuous exercise therapy have been shown effective in the treatment of nonspecific back pain. Sick-leaves and visits to health centers were recorded for 1 year before and after the therapy. The Oswestry disability scores improved most in the bone-setting group (P =.02, Kruskall-Wallis test). Traditional bone-setting seemed more effective than exercise or physiotherapy on back pain and disability, even 1 year after therapy.</s><s>To estimate the effect of adding exercise classes, spinal manipulation delivered in NHS or private premises, or manipulation followed by exercise to \"best care\" in general practice for patients consulting with back pain. 181 general practices in Medical Research Council General Practice Research Framework; 63 community settings around 14 centres across the United Kingdom. For manipulation the additional improvement was 1.6 (0.8 to 2.3) at three months and 1.0 (0.2 to 1.8) at 12 months. Relative to \"best care\" in general practice, manipulation followed by exercise achieved a moderate benefit at three months and a small benefit at 12 months; spinal manipulation achieved a small to moderate benefit at three months and a small benefit at 12 months; and exercise achieved a small benefit at three months but not 12 months.</s><s>To determine the efficacy of osteopathic manipulative treatment as a complementary treatment for chronic nonspecific low back pain. This trial was conducted in a university-based clinic from 2000 through 2001. Of the 199 subjects who responded to recruitment procedures, 91 met the eligibility criteria. They were randomized, with 82 patients completing the 1-month follow-up evaluation, 71 completing the 3-month evaluation, and 66 completing the 6-month evaluation. The subjects who received sham manipulation also reported greater improvements in back pain and physical functioning and greater satisfaction than the no-intervention control subjects. There were no significant benefits with osteopathic manipulative treatment, as compared with sham manipulation. Osteopathic manipulative treatment and sham manipulation both appear to provide some benefits when used in addition to usual care for the treatment of chronic nonspecific low back pain.</s><s>Thirty-two patients with chronic low back pain were treated three times at weekly intervals with rotational manipulation. Patients with femoral or sciatic root pain were included provided they did not exhibit root compression signs. Patients benefitting subjectively from manipulation were more likely to be older and to have had symptoms for a shorter period than those not deriving benefit.</s><s>Many clinical trials on chiropractic management of low back pain have neglected to include specific forms of care. The objective was to compare the outcome of flexion-distraction (FD) procedures performed by chiropractors with an active trunk exercise protocol (ATEP) performed by physical therapists. Subjects, 18 years of age and older, with a primary complaint of low back pain (>3 months) were recruited. Subjects randomly allocated to the flexion-distraction group had significantly greater relief from pain than those allocated to the exercise program (P=0.01). Subgroup analysis indicated that subjects categorized as chronic, with moderate to severe symptoms, improved most with the flexion-distraction protocol. There were no significant differences between groups on the Roland Morris and SF-36 outcome measures. Overall, flexion-distraction provided more pain relief than active exercise; however, these results varied based on stratification of patients with and without radiculopathy and with and without recurrent symptoms.</s><s>A randomized prospective trial of manipulation, massage, corset and transcutaneous muscle stimulation (TMS) was conducted in patients with subacute low back pain. The authors determined the relative efficacy of chiropractic treatment to massage, corset, and TMS. They were evaluated once a week by questionnaires, visual analog scale, range of motion, maximum voluntary extension effort, straight leg raising and Biering-Sorensen fatigue test. The dropout rate was highest in the muscle stimulation and corset groups and lowest in the manipulation group.</s><s>To compare naprapathic manual therapy with evidence-based care for back or neck pain regarding pain, disability, and perceived recovery. Naprapathy that is common in the Nordic countries and in some states in the United States is characterized by manual manipulations with a focus on soft and connective tissues, aiming to decrease pain and disability in the musculoskeletal system. Four hundred and nine patients with pain and disability in the back or neck lasting for at least 2 weeks, recruited at 2 large public companies in Sweden in 2005, were included in this randomized controlled trial. Separate analysis of neck pain and back pain patients showed similar results.</s><s>Chiropractic care is used by many older patients for low back pain (LBP), but there are no published results of randomized trials examining spinal manipulation (SM) for older adults. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of 2 biomechanically distinct forms of SM and minimal conservative medical care (MCMC) for participants at least 55 years old with subacute or chronic nonradicular LBP. Adjusted mean Roland Morris Disability change scores (95% confidence intervals) from baseline to the end of active care were 2.9 (2.2, 3.6) and 2.7 (2.0, 3.3) in the LVVA-SM and HVLA-SM groups, respectively, and 1.6 (0.5, 2.8) in the MCMC group. There were no significant differences between LVVA-SM and HVLA-SM at any of the end points. There were no serious adverse events associated with any of the interventions. Participants who received either form of SM had improvements on average in functional status ranging from 1 to 2.2 over those who received MCMC. From an evidence-based care perspective, patient preference and clinical experience should drive how clinicians and patients make the SM procedure decision for this patient population.</s><s>Practice guidelines recommend various types of exercise and manipulative therapy for chronic back pain but there have been few head-to-head comparisons of these interventions. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to compare effects of general exercise, motor control exercise and manipulative therapy on function and perceived effect of intervention in patients with chronic back pain. Two hundred and forty adults with non-specific low back pain 3months were allocated to groups that received 8weeks of general exercise, motor control exercise or spinal manipulative therapy. Motor control exercise involved retraining specific trunk muscles using ultrasound feedback.</s><s>To assess the long-term benefits of medication, needle acupuncture, and spinal manipulation as exclusive and standardized treatment regimens in patients with chronic (>13 weeks) spinal pain syndromes. Extended follow-up (>1 year) of a randomized clinical trial was conducted at the multidisciplinary spinal pain unit of Townsville's General Hospital between February 1999 and October 2001. Of the 115 patients originally randomized, 69 had exclusively been treated with the randomly allocated treatment during the 9-week treatment period (results at 9 weeks were reported earlier). The main analysis was restricted to 40 patients who had received exclusively the randomly allocated treatment for the whole observation period since randomization. Comparisons of initial and extended follow-up questionnaires to assess absolute efficacy showed that only the application of spinal manipulation revealed broad-based long-term benefit: 5 of the 7 main outcome measures showed significant improvements compared with only 1 item in each of the acupuncture and the medication groups.</s><s>To study the relative efficacy of three different treatment for chronic low back pain (CLBP). The trial evaluated therapies in combination only and was not designed to test the individual treatment components. Patient-rated low back pain, disability, and functional health status at 5 and 11 wk. Individual group comparisons after 5 and 11 wk of intervention on all three main outcome measures did not reveal any clear clinically important or statistically significant differences. There seemed to be a sustained reduction in medication use at the 1-yr follow-up. Continuance of exercise during the follow-up year, regardless of type, was associated with a better outcome. Each of the three therapeutic regimens was associated with similar and clinically important improvement over time that was considered superior to the expected natural history of long-standing CLBP.</s><s>To compare outcomes in perception of pain and disability for a group of patients suffering with chronic low-back pain (CLBP) when managed in a hospital by either a regional pain clinic or a chiropractor. The trial was performed at a National Health Service (NHS) hospital outpatient clinic (pain clinic) in the United Kingdom. The study was pragmatic, allowing for normal treatment protocols to be used. The mean differences between week 0 and week 8 were compared across the two treatment groups using Student's t-tests. Reduction in mean pain intensity at week 8 was 1.8 points greater for the chiropractic group than for the pain-clinic group (p = 0.023).</s><s>To compare the effectiveness of manipulative therapy, physiotherapy, treatment by the general practitioner, and placebo therapy in patients with persistent non-specific back and neck complaints. 256 patients with non-specific back and neck complaints of at least six weeks' duration who had not received physiotherapy or manipulative therapy in the past two years. Physiotherapy consisted of exercises, massage, and physical therapy (heat, electrotherapy, ultrasound, shortwave diathermy). Placebo treatment consisted of detuned shortwave diathermy (10 minutes) and detuned ultrasound (10 minutes). Many patients in the general practitioner and placebo groups received other treatment during follow up. Improvement in the main complaint was larger with manipulative therapy (4.5) than with physiotherapy (3.8) after 12 months' follow up (difference 0.9; 95% confidence interval 0.1 to 1.7). Manipulative therapy also gave larger improvements in physical functioning (difference 0.6; -0.1 to 1.3).</s><s>To determine the efficacy of 2 components of musculoskeletal physiotherapy on chronic low back disorder. Despite their popularity, scant evidence supports their use on subjects with chronic low back disorder. A total of 346 subjects were randomized to manual therapy, a 10-week spinal stabilization rehabilitation program, or a minimal intervention control group. The results indicated statistically significant improvements in favor of the spinal stabilization group at the 6-month stage in pain (65.9% reduction in symptoms) and dysfunction (combined mean reduction of 134, standard error 23.84), and at the 1-year stage in medication (34.3% reduction in medication), dysfunction (combined mean reduction of 134, standard error 18.2), and disability (mean difference in change 15.71 Oswestry Disability Index, 95% confidence interval 19.3-10.01). As a component of musculoskeletal physiotherapy, the spinal stabilization program is more effective than manually applied therapy or an education booklet in treating chronic low back disorder over time. Both manual therapy and the spinal stabilization program are significantly effective in pain reduction in comparison to an active control.</s><s>To examine the effects of 2 manual therapy methods compared with one counselling session with a physiotherapist with \"advice-only to stay active\" for treating low back pain/leg pain and disability. Data on leg and low back pain intensity and disability (Roland-Morris Disability questionnaire) were collected at baseline, and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up points. At the 6-month follow-up, leg pain (-15 mm; 95% confidence interval (CI) -30 to -1), back pain (effect: -15 mm; -27 to -4), and disability index (-4 points; -7 to -1) improved (p < 0.05) more in the McKenzie method group than in the advice-only group. No differences emerged between the orthopaedic manual therapy and McKenzie method groups in pain- and disability-score changes at any follow-up.</s><s>This study examined the short-term effectiveness of vertebral manipulation for treating chronic low back pain and disability. This manual therapy must be preceeded by a specific clinical exam performed by a trained physician.</s><s>The present aim was to compare the effects of stabilizing training with those of manual treatment in patients with sub-acute or chronic low-back pain (LBP). After the treatment period there was a significant difference between the groups in assessed function (P<0.05). At the 3-month follow-up significantly more improved individuals were evident in the ST group regarding pain, general health and functional disability levels. In the long term, significantly more (P<0.05) patients in the MT group reported recurrent treatment periods.</s><s>To compare the effectiveness of medical and chiropractic care for low back pain patients in managed care; to assess the effectiveness of physical therapy among medical patients; and to assess the effectiveness of physical modalities among chiropractic patients. Of 1,469 eligible patients, 681 were enrolled; 95.7% were followed through 6 months. Physical therapy yielded somewhat better 6-month disability outcomes than did medical care alone (1.26, 0.20-2.32). After 6 months of follow-up, chiropractic care and medical care for low back pain were comparable in their effectiveness. Physical therapy may be marginally more effective than medical care alone for reducing disability in some patients, but the possible benefit is small.</s>"

Forty patients with a primary diagnosis of DSM-IV GAD, who continued to experience GAD symptoms despite current anxiolytic treatment of at least 4 weeks' duration, as evidenced by Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) total score > or = 18 and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale score of moderate or greater, completed a 1-week screening phase and were then randomly assigned to 5 weeks of double-blind adjunctive treatment with placebo or risperidone at flexible doses of 0.5 to 1.5 mg/day. Although change scores on other outcome variables, including response rates, were higher in the risperidone group, differences did not achieve statistical significance.</s><s>More data are needed to guide \"next step\" strategies for patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) remaining symptomatic despite initial pharmacotherapy. Adult outpatients with GAD were recruited from 2004 to 2007 at two academic centers. Phase 1 consisted of 10 weeks of open-label paroxetine CR flexibly dosed to a maximum of 62.5 mg/day. Counter to our hypothesis, we did not find significant benefit for quetiapine augmentation of continued paroxetine CR (HAM-A reduction mean +/- SD = 2.6 +/- 5.8 points quetiapine, 0.3 +/- 5.5 points placebo; t = 0.98, df = 20, p = n.s.) Although conclusions are considered preliminary based on the relatively small sample size, our data do not support the addition of quetiapine to continued paroxetine CR for individuals with GAD who remain symptomatic after 10 weeks of prospective antidepressant pharmacotherapy and suggest that further research examining strategies for GAD refractory to antidepressants is needed.</s><s>Residual symptoms despite treatment are common in generalized anxiety disorders (GAD). The Patient-Rated Troubling Symptoms for Anxiety (PaRTS-A) is a newly created and validated instrument that measures the symptoms most troublesome to each individual patient and was used to test the hypothesis that adjunctive risperidone improves residual GAD symptoms. The primary endpoint was change from baseline to week 4 endpoint in PaRTS-A. A post-hoc analysis of PaRTS-A symptoms of moderate to severe severity at baseline suggested greater improvement with risperidone than placebo (P = .04). Headache, weight increase, and increased appetite were the most frequently reported adverse events in both groups. Further exploration of the benefits of risperidone in patients with more severe GAD may be indicated.</s><s>There has been little systematic study of \"next-step\" interventions for patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) who remain symptomatic despite initial pharmacotherapy. There were no other statistically significant differences for olanzapine compared with placebo augmentation in outcome measures, though rates of remission (HAM-A <or= 7) on olanzapine were higher at the level of a trend (FET, p = .1). Average weight gain for completers was greater with olanzapine than placebo augmentation (11.0 +/- 5.1 vs. -0.7 +/- 2.4 pounds: t = 6.32, p < .001). Olanzapine may have a salutary effect on anxiety for some GAD patients remaining symptomatic despite initial serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) therapy, but the emergence of significant weight gain represents an important clinical consideration.</s><s>Based on evidence suggesting anxiolytic properties of the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine, this study was conducted to evaluate whether olanzapine may be efficacious in treating social anxiety disorder (SAD). Baseline to endpoint scores from the Brief Social Phobia Scale (BSPS), Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN), Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale and Sheehan Disability Scale, as well as Clinical Global Impression-Improvement ratings, were compared for olanzapine versus placebo. Both treatments were well tolerated, although the olanzapine group had more drowsiness and dry mouth. Olanzapine was superior to placebo on the primary outcome measures in this preliminary study of SAD.</s><s>Reports have suggested an effect of the atypical antipsychotic quetiapine in anxiety disorders. Fifteen patients were randomized to quetiapine (up to 400 mg/day) or placebo for 8 weeks.

None of the patients were symptomatic or had radiological evidence of bone disease. 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment was associated with a significant fall in serum phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase concentrations as well as with histological evidence of an amelioration of hyperparathyroid changes. In contrast to previous reports, no deterioration of renal function attributable to the treatment occurred, perhaps because a modest dose of 1,25(OH)2D3 was employed combined with meticulous monitoring. Further investigation is required to determine whether alternative therapeutic strategies (smaller doses or intermittent therapy) may avoid the potential for suppressing bone turnover to abnormally low levels in the long term.</s><s>The effect of combined administration of 24R,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (24,25-(OH)2D3) and 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 (1 alpha-(OH)D3) was studied in 24 non-dialyzed patients with chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), matched pairwise as to age, sex, and creatinine clearance (Cr.cl). Then, 1 alpha-(OH)D3 (mean dose 0.55 micrograms daily) was given orally to all patients for 3 months (T0 to T3). Whereas in Group A, serum Ca rose steadily and Cr.cl declined, in Group B both parameters levelled off between T6 and T9. At T9, in Group A the elevated resorption and osteoid indices had normalized markedly, but osteoblasts (Ob.Pm) and mineralizing boundaries (M.Bd) were depressed considerably between T3 and T9. In the patients with high Ob.Pm at T0, cancellous bone area increased significantly.</s><s>Because controlled trials in adults have shown accelerated deterioration of renal function in a small number of patients receiving calcitriol for renal osteodystrophy, we initiated a prospective, randomized, double-blind study of the use of calcitriol versus dihydrotachysterol in children with chronic renal insufficiency. With treatment the height z scores for both calcitriol- and dihydrotachysterol-treated groups showed no differences between the two groups. In relation to cumulative dose, there was a significant decrease in glomerular filtration rate for both calcitriol and dihydrotachysterol; for calcitriol the rate of decline was significantly steeper (p = 0.0026). We conclude that careful follow-up of renal function is mandatory during the use of either calcitriol or dihydrotachysterol because both agents were associated with significant declines in renal function. There was no significant difference between calcitriol and dihydrotachysterol in promoting linear growth or causing hypercalcemia in children with chronic renal insufficiency.</s><s>To determine whether alfacalcidol--used in management of overt renal bone disease--may safely prevent renal bone disease when used earlier in course of renal failure. 17 nephrology centres from Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Quantitative histology of bone to assess efficacy of treatment and renal function to assess safety. Hypercalcaemic episodes occurred in 10 patients given alfacalcidol (but responded to decreases in drug dose) and in three controls. Histological indices of bone turnover significantly improved in patients given alfacalcidol and significantly deteriorated in controls: among patients with abnormal bone histology before treatment, bone disease resolved in 23 (42%) of those given alfacalcidol compared with two (4%) of the controls (P < 0.001). Early administration of alfacalcidol can safely and beneficially alter the natural course of renal bone disease in patients with mild to moderate renal failure.</s><s>Calcitriol lowers parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 3 and 4, but its use is limited by a low therapeutic index and concerns regarding hypercalcemia and acceleration of kidney disease. Pretreatment demographics and biochemical features did not differ between groups. Dosages were increased gradually if iPTH level was not decreased by 30% or greater and serum calcium and phosphorus levels were stable. No clinically significant differences in mean serum calcium or phosphorus or urinary calcium levels or incidence of hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, or hypercalciuria were noted between groups. Serum C- and N-telopeptide and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase levels decreased with doxercalciferol treatment relative to both baseline and placebo (P <0.01). Doxercalciferol is safe and effective in controlling secondary hyperparathyroidism of patients with CKD stages 3 and 4.</s><s>5-25 ml/min) participated in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial of the effects of 1 alpha-hydroxycholecalciferol (1alpha-H.C.C.) It also induced a significant reduction of the raised serum levels of parathyroid hormone. No significant changes were induced in plasma-phosphorus, plasma-alkaline-phosphatase, or in the degree of bone mineralisation as measured by the phosphorus/hydroxyproline ratio in bone.</s><s>Higher doses of calcitriol are effective in lowering markedly elevated 1,84 PTH levels of patients with renal secondary hyperparathyroidism. We carried out a placebo-controlled, double-blind prospective multicentre trial over 12 months in 45 patients with mild to moderate renal failure. The patients received calcium carbonate per os if serum P exceeded 1.7 mmol/l. S-calcium, S-phosphate, and urinary excretion of calcium did not change significantly on either placebo or on calcitriol. There was no significant difference of final S-creatinine or change in S-creatinine between placebo and calcitriol. The results document that a therapeutic window exists in patients with moderate renal failure and elevated of 1,84 iPTH, where low-dose calcitriol (0.125 microgram/day) prevents the increase in 1,84 iPTH without causing side-effects.</s><s>Thirteen patients in the predialysis phase of chronic renal failure (CRF) were treated with calcitriol (0.25 micrograms/day) and 12 with placebo. After 1 year of study, an increase in bone mineral density in the calcitriol group measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was seen for the femoral neck and lumbar spine when compared to the placebo group (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively).</s><s>The bone abnormalities that lead to symptomatic renal osteodystrophy commence early in the course of renal failure, but the optimal time to start treatment needs clarifying. The present study examined the effect of alfacalcidol treatment on bone metabolism and bone density in patients with pre-dialysis chronic renal failure (CRF) in a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled double blind design. A significant difference in BMD between the treatment groups in favour of the alfacalcidol-treated patients was found in the spine (4.2%), the femoral neck (4.9%) and the total femur (3.0%) (P<0.05). No significant changes were found in plasma levels of vitamin D metabolites.</s><s>Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a common feature of chronic renal failure and vitamin D deficiency plays an important role in the development of this abnormality.

Sixteen (16) patients (mean age 51 +/- 16 years; creatinine clearance 22.9 +/- 9.8 ml; range 8-32 ml/min) were treated in a cross-over randomized design with oral daily calcitriol 0.5 micrograms/die (Treatment A), three oral boluses of 2 micrograms of calcitriol a week (Treatment B) and a single oral bolus of 2 micrograms of calcitriol a week (Treatment C). All treatment periods lasted three months and were followed by a wash-out period of one month. No significant differences in renal function were observed during the different study periods.</s><s>Calcitriol oral pulse therapy has been suggested as the treatment of choice for secondary hyperparathyroidism, but its efficacy and safety are still under discussion. The present randomized multicenter study compares the effect of an 8-week course of daily versus intermittent (twice weekly) calcitriol therapy on parathyroid hormone (PTH) suppression in 59 children (mean age 8.4+/-4.7 years) with chronic renal insufficiency (mean Ccr 22.4+/-11.6 ml/min per 1.73 m2) and secondary hyperparathyroidism. At start of the study, the median intact PTH (iPTH) level was 485 pg/ml (range 83-2032) in the daily group (n=29) and 315 pg/ml (range 93-1638) in the intermittent group (n=30). After 8 weeks, the respective median iPTH concentrations were 232 pg/ml (range 63-1614) and 218 pg/ml (range 2-1785) (ns). Calcitriol reduced the iPTH concentration in 23/29 patients in the daily group and in 21/30 in the intermittent group.</s><s>A controlled study of the effects of the potent vitamin-D metabolite, 1, 25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25[OH]2D3), and vitamin D3 was done in 18 non-dialysed patients with chronic renal failure (C.R.F.). After 6 months' observation of the spontaneous course the patients were randomly allocated to 6 months' oral treatment with either 1, 25 (OH)2D3 or vitamin D3 in initial daily doses of 1microgram and 4000 I.U., respectively, combined with 0.5 g calcium. The percentage fall in creatinine clearance was greater during treatment than before treatment in all patients on 1, 25 (OH)2D3 (P less than 0.01) and in 7 of 9 patients on vitamin D3 treatment (though the group change here was not significant). might protect renal function at the expense of abnormalities in mineral metabolism.</s><s>The effects of a small dose of calcitriol (less than or equal to 0.50 micrograms/day) on parathyroid and renal function, bone histomorphometry, and aluminum (Al) metabolism were studied in a randomized double blind study of 30 patients with predialysis chronic renal failure. Calcitriol treatment did not significantly influence either serum A1 levels or the presence of stainable Al in bone. We conclude that a low dose of calcitriol may be used to preserve or even restore bone metabolism in patients with predialysis chronic renal failure if serum calcium is closely followed and hypercalcemia promptly treated.</s><s>The safety and efficacy of paricalcitol injection have been well established for the prevention and treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5. Enrollment criteria included an estimated glomerular filtration rate between 15 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (0.25 and 1.00 mL/s/1.73 m2), an average of 2 consecutive intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels greater than 150 pg/mL (ng/L), 2 consecutive serum calcium levels between 8.0 and 10.0 mg/dL (2.00 and 2.50 mmol/L), and 2 consecutive serum phosphorus levels of 5.2 mg/dL or less (< or = 1.68 mmol/L). Two studies used a thrice-weekly dosing regimen and 1 study used a once-daily dosing regimen for 24 weeks. Two hundred twenty patients participated (n = 107, paricalcitol; n = 113, placebo). Similarly, no significant differences in urinary calcium and phosphorus excretion or deterioration in kidney function were detected in patients administered paricalcitol compared with placebo. Paricalcitol capsule was well tolerated and effectively decreased iPTH levels with minimal or no impact on calcium levels, phosphorus balance, and kidney function in patients with stages 3 and 4 CKD.</s>"

The tumor appears to arise as masses in the abdominal cavity without a clear visceral origin. Five patients with DSRCT were treated as usual with combined chemoradiation and surgery. Charts of 5 patients (4 males, mean age of 11 years) treated between 2000 and 2007 were reviewed. The diagnosis of DSRCT was made on the basis of clinical examination, computed tomographic scan, and explorative laparotomy with biopsy, and biochemical markers were negative.</s><s>A total of 23 patients were treated at five dose escalations with high-dose combination cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, and melphalan with autologous bone marrow support. The maximum tolerated doses of cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, and melphalan were 5,625, 180, and 80 mg/m2, respectively. Objective tumor regression occurred in 14 of 18 evaluable cases, with a median duration of 3.5 months.

One patient with malignant fibrous histiocytoma recurred with multiple lung metastases. This patient achieved a partial response after two cycles of induction chemotherapy consisting of ifosfamide and epirubicin. Tandem high-dose ICE regimen (ifosfamide 3 g/m2 on days-7 to -3, carboplatin 400 mg/m2 on days-7, -5 and 3, etoposide 500 mg/m2 on days-7, -5 and 3) supported by autologous PBSCT gave rise to further regression of the tumors. Relapse-free intervals until the 1st, 2nd and 3rd relapses were 40, 19 and 22 months, respectively. These observations suggest that a tandem high-dose ICE regimen with autologous PBSCT is feasible with some clinical efficacy in the control of refractory STS.</s><s>We report a case of metastatic gastrointestinal leiomyosarcoma treated with high-dose combination chemotherapy and autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.

The steep dose-response curve of many of these tumors to alkylating agents makes myeloablative chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) an attractive potential therapy. The role of ASCT for these high-risk patients is yet to be conclusively determined. We have transplanted 36 patients on two consecutive protocols with a variety of histological diagnoses.

Complications related to the treatment were limited to one patient who developed hepatic veno-occlusive disease, no serious complications were seen in the other patients. Four patients died of their disease, one patient was alive with the disease and 5 patients were alive with no evidence of disease.

Courses started after neutrophil counts reached 500/microL and platelet counts reached 100,000/microL. Post-P6 treatment options included radiotherapy and a myeloablative regimen of thiotepa (900 mg/m2) plus carboplatin (1,500 mg/m2), with stem-cell rescue. Ten previously untreated and two previously treated patients have completed therapy. Other findings included serosal implants (n = 11), regional lymph node invasion (n = 8), ascites or pleural effusion (n = 7), and metastases to liver (n = 5), lungs (n = 4), distant lymph nodes (n = 3), spleen (n = 2), and skeleton (n = 2).

Thereafter, the patient received autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation with high-dose chemotherapy (combination of ifosphamide, carboplatin and etoposide) as pretreatment. The clinical course of this patient strongly suggests that this was a case of treatment-related CML that developed after chemotherapy for MFH.</s><s>A case is described of a 19-year-old man with poor prognosis intra-abdominal desmoplastic small round cell tumor, who achieved a durable complete remission after aggressive multimodality treatment. He was diagnosed with a large peri-rectal mass and bulky metastases to the peritoneum, omentum and liver. This was followed by resection of the omentum and cryotherapy to six of the liver lesions. He then achieved a complete response following high-dose busulfan 16 mg/kg and melphalan 140 mg/m2 with autologous stem cell support.</s><s>The prognosis of metastatic malignant mesenchymal tumors (MMT) remains poor. Given the chemosensitivity of these neoplasms, a phase II study of high-dose thiotepa (HDT) was performed to evaluate the efficacy of this drug in this particular subset of pediatric tumors. Thiotepa was administered at a daily dose of 300 mg/m2 for 3 consecutive days. HDT used at a dose of 900 mg/m2 yields measurable anti-tumor activity in previously treated patients.</s><s>Patients with locally advanced or metastatic/recurrent soft tissue and Ewing's sarcoma (EWS) have few treatment options. The first cycle of HDCT consisted of doxorubicin (150 mg/m(2)) and ifosfamide (14 g/m(2)) mixed with mesna (14 g/m(2)), while the second cycle consisted of melphalan (150 mg/m(2)) and cisplatin (200 mg/m(2)).

Toxicity was severe and dose-related, with the maximum tolerated dose for the combination determined to be Cy 160 mg/kg and BCNU 900 mg/m2. Sixteen of 20 evaluable patients (80%) responded to therapy with at least 50% reduction in measurable tumor, and three patients achieved complete remission (CR). Responders included eight of nine evaluable patients with breast carcinoma, two of five with melanoma, two of two with sarcoma, and four of four with colon carcinoma.</s><s>We treated 49 patients with recurrent or poor-prognosis CNS malignancies with high-dose chemotherapy regimens followed by autologous marrow rescue with or without peripheral-blood stem-cell augmentation to determine the toxicity of and event-free survival after these regimens. Thirty-seven received chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide 1.5 g/m2 daily x 4 and melphalan 25 to 60 mg/m2 daily x 3. Of five patients assessable for disease response, one had a partial remission (2 months), one has had stable disease (55+ months), and three showed progression 2, 5, and 8 months after transplantation. Certain patients with high-risk CNS malignancies may benefit from such a treatment approach. Subsequent trials should attempt to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem-cell rescue.</s><s>The authors evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of cisplatin, ifosfamide, and doxorubicin with peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) support in adult patients with osteosarcomas and variants with a poor prognosis. Ten patients had pelvic osteosarcomas (OS), 6 had malignant fibrous histiocytomas, 5 had metastatic OS, and 16 had miscellaneous histologies. The authors used doxorubicin (60-75 mg/m(2)) and ifosfamide (10 g/m(2)) followed by granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (5 microg/kg twice per day) for mobilization of PBSC, collected at a median of 12 days (range, 10-14 days). Patients received a median of three cycles (range, one to three cycles) in addition to the mobilizing cycle. Six patients required early discontinuation of therapy due to toxicities, two patients developed progressive disease, and one patient was deemed unresectable. The authors accomplished the objective of improving the rate of necrosis with intensification of preoperative therapy. The toxicity profile of this regimen is prohibitive and alternative strategies need to be investigated.</s><s>Desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT) is a rare soft tissue tumor of primitive origin occurring primarily in children and young adults. Between August 1994 and March 1998, we evaluated three consecutive patients with DSRCT at Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center, Seattle, Washington. We established the diagnosis based on clinical presentation, radiologic staging, and pathologic review with immunohistochemical staining. All patients received a combined modality protocol including dose-intensive chemotherapy (two of them with peripheral blood stem cell [PBSC] support), second look surgery, and consolidative local irradiation. Two of our patients were younger than any previously reported patient, extending the age group for which DSRCT should be considered on diagnosis of small round cell tumors.</s><s>Malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT) is a rare and highly aggressive tumor that primarily occurs in very young children. Although the tumor was not completely removed, and the initial chemotherapy failed, the patient achieved long-term survival after this modality of treatment.</s><s>The Department of Musculoskeletal System Tumors was formed in November 1989 within Research Institute of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology of N. N. Blokhin Russian Oncological Scientific Center of Russian Academy of Medical Sciences. Treatment is carried out with the newest achievements in oncopediatrics applied; priority is given to limb-sparing techniques. The total 5-year survival rate of patients with Ewing's sarcoma is 65.6%, the total 2-year survival rate of patients with soft tissue sarcomas is 62.2%, and the total 2-year survival rate of children with osteosarcoma is 76%. In 2003 and 2004, leading researcher N. M. Ivanova was awarded the institution's diplomas as a part of Biotech prize for the development of new methods of treatment of malignant tumors in children.</s><s>Whether high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell support improves the long-term outcome for these patients or not is controversial. Six patients died within 8 months due to PD, in 18 patients disease recurred and led to death and 13 patients are alive with/without disease. A subgroup of patients with NED before high-dose chemotherapy gained survival benefit. Therefore, we emphasize the value of high-dose chemotherapy as a treatment option for younger patients with a good performance status in partial or complete remission.</s><s>Carboplatin and melphalan are two drugs whose toxicity profile makes them suitable for use in high doses followed by stem cell rescue. We report the use of high-dose carboplatin, with the dose based on glomerular filtration rate (GFR), combined with melphalan followed by autologous stem cell rescue in children with advanced stage or chemoresistant solid tumours. After multiagent induction chemotherapy before BMT, 13 were in CR, five in VGPR, 11 in PR and one had progressive disease. They received melphalan, 180 mg/m2 and carboplatin, followed by autologous stem cell rescue. Life-threatening or fatal toxicity was attributable to opportunistic infection in two cases and regimen-related in two cases.</s><s>Whether high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell support improves the long-term outcome for these patients is debatable. After standard chemotherapy, PR (n=10), stable disease (SD, n=6) and progressive disease (PD, n=14) were attained for the evaluable patients. Median OS was 23.7 months (range 12-34) vs 10.8 months (range 0-39), respectively. The subgroup of patients treated with high-dose chemotherapy gained significant survival benefit. Nevertheless, high-dose chemotherapy as a possible consolidation strategy remains highly investigational.</s><s>Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a rare disorder characterized by hyperthermia, elevated creatine phosphokinase, extrapyramidal effects, autonomic instability, altered level of consciousness and leukocytosis associated with neuroleptic and other psychotropic medications.</s><s>Topotecan appears to be relatively unaffected by the most common multidrug resistance mechanisms, may potentiate cytotoxicity of alkylators, has good penetration into the central nervous system, is active against a variety of neoplasms, and has myelosuppression as its paramount toxicity. infusion on days -5, -4, -3 with a daily dose derived from the pediatric Calvert formula, using a targeted area under the curve of seven mg/ml* min ( approximately 500 mg/m2/day). The patients were 1 to 29 (median 4) years old; 18 were in complete remission (CR) and three in partial remission (PR). Post-transplant treatment included radiotherapy alone (four patients) or plus biological agents (11 patients with neuroblastoma). Favorable results for disease control, manageable toxicity, and the antitumor profiles of topotecan, thiotepa, and carboplatin, support use of this three-drug regimen in the treatment of neuroblastoma and brain tumors; applicability to other tumors is still uncertain.</s><s>Metastatic sarcomas have a poor prognosis with current therapeutic regimens. Nine patients with high grade metastatic sarcomas were treated with HDC followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation. Four patients received HDC as a consolidation of the complete response (CR) obtained with chemotherapy (CT) and two of them were free from disease at 27 and 41 months, respectively. Other four patients had a disease total or partially refractory to conventional CT, and in one case the sensitivity to the chemotherapeutical agents was unknown.</s><s>Synovial sarcoma (SS) is a rare soft-tissue tumor that affects children and young adults. It is characterized by chromosomal translocation t(X;18)(p11.2;q11.2), which results in the fusion of the gene SYT on chromosome 18 with SSX genes on chromosome X. We report a case of a 9-year-old boy with a high-grade spindle cell sarcoma. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction revealed a characteristic translocation of SSs.</s><s>Intraabdominal desmoplastic small round cell tumors (IDSRCT) are rare in children and predominantly affect male adolescents and young adults. We present our experience in the management of five children with diffuse IDSRCT, managed with aggressive chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. During the last decade five patients, four males and one female (mean age 9.6 years), with diffuse IDSRCT were managed in our department. The main symptoms were abdominal distention, vague abdominal pain, and vomiting. Three patients with inoperable tumor on admission were submitted initially to open biopsy followed by aggressive chemotherapy. Three patients who had radical excision of the tumor and adjuvant chemotherapy had recurrence after two to six months. In addition, one patient with recurrence received radiotherapy and two others underwent peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. Radical surgical excision, radiotherapy and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation does not seem to improve prognosis significantly.</s><s>Desmoplastic round cell tumor (DSCT) is a highly malignant abdominal tumor first described in 1991, with subsequent cases predominantly noted in pathologic case reports. Each patient showed initial tumor regression during chemotherapy, but developed progressive disease within 8-18 months. A comprehensive literature review of clinical data on 101 reported cases of DSCT is presented. The median age was 21 years (range 6-38 years) with 78 male patients and 23 female patients. Ninety-nine cases involved tumor mass in the abdominal-pelvic cavity in proximity to the mesentery. Tumor response to chemotherapy was noted in approximately 50% of 40 patients who received combinations of doxorubicin, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and/or 5-fluorouracil. Four of 13 patients who received additional radiotherapy were alive at 24-48 months.</s><s>The disease-free survival of children with malignant disorders has increased impressively over the last three decades due to better understanding of tumour biology and the resultant improvement in diagnosis and therapy. Children with advanced and relapsed solid tumours, such as brain tumour, alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, or neuroblastoma, have not benefited from this progress. The interest in HDT intensified when autologous stem cells mobilised from the peripheral blood became available, in view of the possibility of increasing the cell dose, which correlates directly with the time period of haematopoietic recovery and thus reduces therapy-associated toxicity. 11 children aged between 2.8 and 17.2 years with brain tumours, soft tissue sarcomas, germ-cell tumours and neuroblastomas were analysed over a 2-year-period. 7 of the 11 children are in complete remission 2+ and 24+ months after HDT, 3 died of progressive disease and one child died of therapy-associated complications. Single or double HDT with autologous PBSCT after each cycle is feasible in children and offers basic data for conducting phase III paediatric clinical studies.</s><s>The identification of recently described nonrandom chromosomal defects specific for various small round-cell and spindle-cell sarcomas can eliminate diagnostic uncertainty arising from the clinical and histopathologic overlap of soft tissue neoplasms. Treatment was instituted using cycles of high-dose cyclophosphamide (4,200 mg/m2) with doxorubicin (75 mg/m2). The tumor was histologically undifferentiated and immunoreactive for vimentin but negative for other markers. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction revealed the SYT/SSX2 fusion transcript of the synovial sarcoma t(X;18) chromosomal rearrangement. This clinically unique case of synovial sarcoma highlights how the use of now readily available molecular techniques will allow more accurate appraisals of the incidence and anatomic distribution of soft tissue neoplasms-information that bears upon pathogenesis and treatment.</s><s>Despite the availability of combined-modality treatment for Ewing sarcoma (ES) and soft tissue sarcomas (STS), results from independent groups still indicate a poor prognosis for high-risk and metastasized patients. Here, we report of HDCT in 35 consecutive adult patients with poor-risk ES or rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 11) and STS (n = 24) undergoing ASCT between July 1992 and March 2003. At a median follow-up of 100.6 months after ASCT, 11 patients are alive, with nine in sustained complete remission (CR) and each one in partial remission (PR) and stable disease.</s><s>Malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) is a soft-tissue sarcoma created from fibroblast cells and characterized by a high rate of metastasis or recurrence with poor prognosis. We report a case of initially well differentiated (G1) MFH of the trunk in a 33-year-old woman. Two years after primary diagnosis, metastases were found in the lung, trunk, gluteus region, upper extremities and brain. Initial surgery of several solid tumors on the trunk, lung and extremities was performed.</s><s>Synovial sarcoma in an 11-year-old Japanese girl relapsed 5 months after autologous stem cell transplantation. Dendritic cells were pulsed with synthetic peptides containing a junctional region of SYT-SSX2 fusion protein generated by t(X;18) and were administered once per week.</s><s>Intensified chemotherapy may improve the outcome of patients with high-risk pediatric sarcomas. The authors investigated the feasibility of administering these agents concomitantly within a defined period. In the prospective high-risk sarcoma (HIRISA) Phase II trial HIRISA1, pediatric patients with high-risk sarcomas received 3 cycles of intensive vincristine, ifosfamide, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin (VACIE) before radiotherapy and/or surgery began at Week 9 with concurrent vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin (Week 9) and vincristine and ifosfamide (Week 12). After delayed hematologic recovery in the first 11 patients, the protocol was modified (HIRISA2) to delay local control therapy until after 5 cycles of VACIE (to be completed within 18 weeks). Patients who responded to the protocols were eligible for myeloablative consolidation with autologous stem cell support. Major nonhematologic toxic effects were mucositis, nutritional impairment, hypotension, and peripheral neuropathy.</s><s>Desmoplastic small round cell tumour (DSRCT) is a recently described neoplasm, typically occurring in adolescent and young males. The authors report two additional cases of DSRCT and review the available medical literature. Two young males with intra-abdominal DSRCT were treated with a first-line chemotherapy including carboplatin, doxorubicin and etoposide. Both of the patients obtained a partial response after first-line chemotherapy. The first patient started, subsequently, CD34+ stem cell mobilisation with high-dose cyclophosphamide (7 g/m(2)) in order to perform high-dose chemotherapy, but CD34+ cell count was insufficient to practice leukapheresis; he died 34 months after the diagnosis because of progression of the disease. This experience confirms that DSRCT may be considered a chemosensitive tumour, highly aggressive, with short-lasting response to chemotherapy.</s><s>A 22-year-old woman with a newly detected chondroid liposarcoma located in the iliac muscle was diagnosed as having bilateral pulmonary embolism. The thrombus was attributed to a hypercoagulability state which has been described for chondroid liposarcoma. Despite therapeutic anticoagulation, repeated imaging showed no reduction or remodeling of the thrombus. We conclude that in sarcoma patients intravascular tumor growth must be kept in mind when imaging is suggestive for thrombosis.</s><s>Central Nervous System (CNS) rhabdoid tumours are a highly malignant group of neoplasms usually occurring in children under 2 years of age with characteristic histopathologic findings but unclear histiogenesis and almost uniformly fatal outcome. The clinical course and the successful outcome of therapy in two children with primary CNS rhabdoid tumour are described in this context. Following this, one of the patients received high dose therapy (busulphan and thiotepa), whereas the other had craniospinal radiotherapy with a boost to the primary site. Their favourable outcomes are compared with those of 49 others reported in the literature.</s><s>Extracranial malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT) is a rare, aggressive, pediatric malignancy with a historically poor outcome. Recent efforts to intensify treatment for MRT have resulted in isolated reports of long-term survival. The authors conducted a retrospective review of consecutive patients with MRT at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles over the 20 years from 1983 to 2003. Five patients had renal primary tumors, and 9 patients had extrarenal tumors. Consolidation with HSCT may benefit selected patients with advanced disease stage.</s><s>In nine patients (pts) with soft tissue sarcoma refractory to conventional therapy (incomplete response or relapse) intensified chemotherapy was administered combining 0.75 mg/m (2) topotecan, 100 mg/m (2) etoposide, 100 mg/m (2) carboplatin and 200 mg/m (2) cyclophosphamide on day 1-5 (TECC). To avoid prolonged intervals between the serial TECC courses autologous hematopoietic stem cell supports (median 1.0 x 10(6) CD34+ cells per kg body weight (bw), range 0.5-2.8 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg bw, SD 0.6 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg bw) were given on day 7. In this period pts received 0.83 (range 0-1) red blood cell units and 2.35 (range 1-4) platelet units. C-reactive protein in neutropenic pts as an indicator for infection after TECC chemotherapy was detectable after 36 of 39 chemotherapy courses leading to further supportive therapy (median 10.4 mg/dl, range 1.1-28.3 mg/dl; SD 6.67 mg/dl). Clinical and objective tumor responses, defined as complete remission, very good partial response and partial response were observed in 9/9 pts at eight weeks after the last TECC course and were maintained at six months in 7/9 pts. Median time to progression and median overall survival time after TECC chemotherapy were 20.3 months and 25.2 months, respectively. Therefore, this regimen warrants further investigation in prospective trials.</s><s>Synovial sarcoma (SS) is the most common nonrhabdomyosarcomatous soft tissue sarcoma in childhood, but the head-neck site accounts for less than 5% of cases. The authors report a 10-year-old boy with SYT-SSX1 positive left parapharyngeal SS, resistant to front-line VAIA chemotherapy, who obtained a good partial response by salvage regimen (I(3)VE + CEV + I(3)VE) and local radiotherapy, so a complete surgical resection could be performed. The child remains in complete remission at 36 months after completion of treatment.</s><s>Umbilical metastases, also named Sister Mary Joseph's nodules, are well documented in the adult population and most often represent an underlying intra-abdominal malignancy, usually a carcinoma of gastrointestinal or gynecologic origin. They are indicative of widespread abdominal disease and are associated with a poor prognosis. The diagnosis of an intra-abdominal malignancy, most commonly a DSRCT, should be considered in the presence of an umbilical mass in a child.</s><s>We present a child diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme during infancy and successfully treated with the 'eight-in-one' chemotherapy regimen, who developed an intracranial fibrosarcoma 5 years later. After resection of the fibrosarcoma, she received cranial radiation therapy and high dose chemotherapy with bone marrow transplant.</s><s>Sixteen consecutive stem cell transplantations (SCT) were performed after myeloablative chemotherapy in patients with high-risk solid tumors of childhood. Seven patients received autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT), seven received peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) and two received ABMT + PBSCT. The progression-free survival was similar in three types of transplants (57% ABMT, 43% PBSCT vs. 50% ABMT + PBSCT). There was no statistically significant difference in the hematopoietic recovery time between each group. The disease-free survival was 71% for neuroblastoma, 50% for small round cell tumors and 25% for rhabdomyosarcoma.</s><s>Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) were used to augment autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT), aiming to hasten engraftment after high dose treatment in a group of heavily pretreated patients. PBSC were obtained by leukapheresis during the rebound after standard chemotherapy. In 11 patients aged 7-17 years, high dose chemotherapy consisted of busulphan 16 mg/kg orally with melphalan 160 mg/m2 intravenously for seven patients, and melphalan 200 mg/m2 intravenously alone for four. Neutrophil recovery to > or = 0.5 x 10(9)/l and platelet transfusion independence occurred at a median of 14 days (11-18) and 22 days (9-84) respectively. PBSC harvesting in these children was undertaken without interrupting routine chemotherapy and without the use of bone marrow growth factors.</s><s>To increase the dose intensity (DI) of chemotherapy for pediatric patients with metastatic sarcomas, including the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT) and rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), the authors tested the feasibility of an intensive regimen supported by granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC). Courses of therapy were repeated every 21 days or as soon as hematopoietic recovery permitted. PBSC were collected twice: first, after Course 2 (infused after Courses 3 and 4) and, second, after Course 4 (infused after Courses 5 and 6). Seventeen patients (74%) achieved a complete response (CR), 12 patients with chemotherapy alone and 5 more patients after undergoing surgical resection. Fifteen patients developed progressive disease, with a 2-year event free survival (EFS) rate of 39% (95% confidence interval, 19-59%). Hematopoietic toxicity was severe and cumulative, although it was less than that seen previously without PBSC support.</s><s>In total, 18 of 26 double high-dose chemotherapies (HDCT) in pediatric solid tumors were rescued with peripheral blood stem cells collected during a single leukapheresis round (single-harvest group, SHG). Stem cell collection after HDCT1 was inefficient and delayed in patients who had received prior chemotherapy before HDCT1. However, there was no difference in hematologic recovery between SHG and DHG. Therefore, to administer the second HDCT earlier in double HDCT, and thus to improve the survival of patients with high-risk solid tumors, the single-harvest approach is recommended rather than the double-harvest approach.</s>"

Thirteen patients who had been randomized to treatment without reaming were switched to the group that had reaming because of technical reasons; these patients were excluded from the analysis of the results. The two groups were similar with regard to demographics and the configurations of the fractures. The duration of fluoroscopy was not significantly different between the two groups (p = 0.35, Mann-Whitney test). Seventy fractures (96 per cent) that were treated with nailing with reaming and fifty-six (89 per cent) that were treated with nailing without reaming united without the need for an additional operation (p = 0.19). There was only one deep infection, which developed after nailing without reaming. Four malunions were of very proximal fractures and one was of a very distal fracture. There was a higher prevalence of delayed union and breakage of screws after nailing without reaming.</s><s>The objective was to determine whether the number of interlocking screws have an impact on hardware failure. In a clinical prospective randomized study of skeletally mature patients with diaphyseal tibial fractures, 44 were randomized pre-operatively into the two treatment arms over a two-year period. Of eligible patients, 22 had one distal locking screw and 20 had two distal locking screws. Screw failure occurred more often in heavier patients and usually between six and 12 weeks.</s><s>To compare ender nails and unreamed interlocking nails in a randomized clinical trial study. Sixty-seven patients underwent surgery with interlocking nails and 64 with ender nails. The results of our study support those of other studies that indicate the choice between the 2 methods of unreamed nailing is mainly controversial, depending on the priorities of the patient and surgeon.</s><s>Anterior knee pain is the most common complication after intramedullary nailing of the tibia. Dissection of the patellar tendon and its sheath during nailing is thought to be a contributing cause of chronic anterior knee pain. Twenty-one patients from both study groups were followed for an average of three years after nailing. After fracture union, all but two patients had elective nail removal through the same surgical approach as was used for the nailing. Of these fourteen patients, thirteen were mildly to severely impaired by the pain. Fifteen (71%) of the twenty-one patients treated with paratendinous nailing reported anterior knee pain, and ten of the fifteen were impaired by the pain.</s><s>To compare anterior and deep posterior compartment pressures during reamed and unreamed intramedullary nailing of displaced, closed tibial shaft fractures. Forty-eight adults with forty-nine fractures treated with intramedullary nailing within three days of injury. After intraoperative placement of compartment pressure monitors, the tibia fractures were treated by either unreamed intramedullary nailing or reamed intramedullary nailing. A fracture table and skeletal traction were not used in any of these procedures. The average pressures quickly returned to less than thirty millimeters of mercury and remained there for the duration of the study. These data support acute (within three days of injury) reamed intramedullary nailing of closed, displaced tibial shaft fractures without the use of a fracture table.</s><s>To determine if any differences exist in healing and complications between reamed and unreamed nailing in patients with tibial shaft fractures. Forty-five patients with displaced closed and open Gustilo type I-IIIA fractures of the central two thirds of the tibia. The average time to fracture healing was 16.7 weeks in the reamed group and 25.7 weeks in the unreamed group. There were two malunions in the reamed group and four malunions in the unreamed group. Unreamed nailing in patients with tibial shaft fractures may be associated with higher rates of secondary operations and malunions compared with reamed nailing.</s><s>For unstable tibial fractures, there are many methods of surgical treatment. The efficacy of the Ender nail and the interlocking nail in the treatment of such fractures is examined. Randomly, 61 tibia were fixed with interlocking nails and 46, with Ender nails. In the group with Ender nails, the average blood loss was 135 cc, operation time was 32 minutes, hospital days were 8.3 days, and union time was 17.6 weeks for closed fractures and 22.5 weeks for Winquist-Hansen type III and IV fractures. However, treatment with the different nails showed no significant difference in results for open type I and II fractures.</s>"

This procedure has been performed with the patient in the hypothyroid state to promote endogenous TSH stimulation and is often associated with hypothyroid symptoms and impaired quality of life. OBJECTIVE AND INTERVENTION: This international, randomized, controlled, multicenter trial aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) to prepare euthyroid patients on L-thyroxine therapy (euthyroid group) to ablate remnant thyroid tissue with 3.7 GBq (100 mCi) 131I, compared with that with conventional remnant ablation performed in the hypothyroid state (hypothyroid group). After the administration of the 131-I dose, the rate of radiation clearance from blood, thyroid remnant, and whole body was measured. The predefined primary criterion for successful ablation was \"no visible uptake in the thyroid bed, or if visible, fractional uptake less than 0.1%\" on neck scans performed 8 months after therapy and was satisfied in 100% of patients in both groups.</s><s>(a) To compare the efficacy of low-activity (2 GBq; 54 mCi) (131)I ablation using l-thyroxine withdrawal or rhTSH stimulation, and (b) to assess the influence of thyroid remnants volume on the ablation rate. Group A: preparation by L-T(4) withdrawal (37 days); 21 patients received (131)I (2.02+/-0.22 GBq; 54.6+/-5.9 mCi) and on the day of treatment, TSH, Tg, TgAb were measured; Group B: stimulation by rhTSH; 21 patients received (131)I (1.97+/-0.18 GBq; 53.2+/-4.9 mCi) 24 h after the second injection of rhTSH (0.9 mg) and TSH, Tg and TgAb were measured after 2 days. The use of rhTSH for the preparation of low-risk patients to ablation therapy with low activities of (131)I (2 GBq; 54 mCi) is safe and effective and avoids hypothyroidism. The presence of thyroid remnants smaller than 1 ml at US evaluation had no effect on the ablation rate.</s><s>Recently, a multicenter study in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) patients showed that 3700 MBq 131-iodine ((131)I) after recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) had a successful thyroid ablation rate similar to that obtained after thyroid hormone withdrawal. A total of 72 patients with DTC were randomly assigned to receive 1850 (group A, n = 36) or 3700 MBq (group B, n = 36) (131)I after rhTSH. One injection of 0.9 mg rhTSH was administered for 2 consecutive days; (131)I therapy was delivered 24 h after the last injection, followed by a posttherapy whole-body scan. Successful ablation (no visible uptake in the diagnostic whole-body scan after rhTSH stimulation) was achieved in 88.9% of group A and B patients. Similar rates of ablation were obtained in both groups also in patients with node metastases.</s><s>In thyroidectomized patients, increased levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) are necessary to maximize I uptake. The availability of a genetically engineered version of the recombinant human TSH (rh-TSH) provides an alternative tool to enhance the TSH serum level without inducing hypothyroidism. Forty-six DTC patients, submitted to I ablative therapy, were randomly divided in group A (pre-treated with rh-TSH) and group B (treated after L-T4 withdrawal for 30 days). The red-marrow absorbed dose per unit administered activity and the remnant cumulated activity per unit administered activity were calculated for both groups. The remnant cumulated activity per unit administered activity in 10 rh-TSH treated patients is 0.9+/-0.8 h; that calculated in 21 hypothyroid patients is 1.55+/-1.05 h (two-tailed unpaired t-test P=0.063).</s>"

These were: control, with the patient resting in an upright position; chest physiotherapy, by the forced expiration technique with postural drainage; and chest physiotherapy following five minutes' inhalation of either nebulised normal saline or nebulised terbutaline 5 mg.

The present large randomized trial was designed to finally settle this issue. In a prospective study performed exclusively in a multicenter private practice setting involving 6 examiners with substantial lifetime experience (>10,000 colonoscopies), 1256 patients (men:women, 47%:53%; mean age, 64.4 y) were randomized to HDTV screening colonoscopy with either NBI or white-light imaging on instrument withdrawal. The primary outcome measure was the adenoma detection rate (ie, number of adenomas/total number of patients). This was despite a minimal, but significantly longer, withdrawal time in the NBI group (8.5 vs 7.9 min; P < .05).</s><s>Colonoscopy is an established method of colorectal cancer screening, but has an adenoma miss rate of 10-20%. Detection rates are expected to improve with optimised visualisation methods. The primary outcome parameter was the difference in the adenoma detection rate between the two techniques. Adenomas were detected more frequently in the NBI group (23%) than in the control group (17%) with a number of 17 colonoscopies needed to find one additional adenoma patient; however, the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.129). The increased adenoma detection rate means of NBI colonoscopy were statistically not significant.</s><s>Narrow band imaging (NBI) might highlight adenomas and lead to higher rates of adenoma detection. Both the prevalences of adenomas and the numbers of adenomas per colonoscopy are the highest ever reported in colonoscopy studies. This result does not exclude a possible benefit of NBI in reducing variation between endoscopists in detection of adenomas. The very high adenoma detection rate in this study suggests that high definition should be directly tested for its effect on detection of adenomas.</s><s>Detection and removal of adenomas by colonoscopy is an important means for preventing cancer; however, small adenomas may be missed during colonoscopy. However, no randomized, controlled trials have evaluated the efficacy of a pan-colonic NBI system in adenoma detection. Two hundred forty-three patients were randomized, 121 to conventional colonoscopy and 122 to pan-colonic NBI system. Demographics, indication for colonoscopy, and quality of preparation were similar between groups. The proportions of patients with at least one adenoma and those with multiple adenomas were not significantly different between groups. The pan-colonic NBI system allowed detection of more diminutive adenomas in the distal colon than did conventional colonoscopy (P < 0.01), and more patients in the NBI group had at least one diminutive adenoma than in the control group (P < 0.05). These results indicate that routine use of the NBI system for surveillance of diminutive adenomas may be recommended.</s><s>Colonoscopy, the \"gold standard\" screening test for colorectal cancer (CRC), has known diagnostic limitations. Advances in endoscope technology have focused on improving mucosal visualisation. We aimed to study the neoplasia diagnostic characteristics of NBI, by comparing the neoplasm miss rate when the colonoscopy was performed under NBI versus white light (WL). We randomly assigned patients to undergo a colonoscopic examination using NBI or WL. All patients underwent a second examination using WL, as the reference standard. NBI did not improve the colorectal neoplasm miss rate compared to WL; the miss rate for advanced adenomas was less than 1% and for all adenomas was 12%. The neoplasm detection rates were similar high using NBI or WL; almost a half the study patients had at least one adenoma.</s><s>Narrow band imaging (NBI) is an imaging technique that allows a better definition of capillary pattern and improves the contrast between adenomas and the surrounding mucosa. Conflicting data exist on the ability of NBI to improve detection of colonic neoplasm; the impact of NBI is being tested in several screening scenarios. They were randomly assigned to groups that were examined with WL (n = 108) or NBI (n = 103) during the withdrawal phase of their colonoscopies. The prevalence of non-polypoid and the total number of adenomas were also evaluated. The number of total and mean per-patient adenomas were 201 (1.95 +/- 2.3) and 198 (1.83 +/- 2.1) in the NBI and WL groups, respectively (P = .69). The adenoma detection rates were 57.3% for patients examined by NBI and 58.3% for those examined by WL (P = .88).

This was motivated by the findings that following visual cortex injury in animals, the size of receptive fields could be enlarged by systematic costimulation, where two stimuli were used to excite visual cortex neurons (Eysel, Eyding, & Schweigart, 1998). However, the type of training did not make any difference such that the three training groups profited equally. A more detailed analysis of trained versus untrained visual field areas in 16 patients revealed a superiority of the trained area of only 1.1% in HRP and between 3.5% (OS) and 4.4% (OD) in TAP. Spatial attention and alertness improved significantly in all three groups and correlated significantly with visual field enlargements. The improvements in trained as well as in untrained areas are explained by top-down attentional control mechanisms interacting with local visual cortex plasticity.</s><s>The purpose of this study was to determine whether a cognitive skills remediation program could help acute stroke patients regain important thinking skills.

Group 1 (n = 8) first used extrastriate VRT followed by conventional standard VRT. Visual field size was assessed with computer-based perimetry and subjective vision with the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ). In group 1, stimulus detection in high-resolution perimetry (HRP) improved by 5.9% (P < .01) after extrastriate VRT.

The role of autobiographical memory in describing how to perform everyday activities. ), in which they were asked to describe how they would plan eight common unstructured activities, i.e. The results suggested that the intervention was effective at increasing the number of specific memories recalled, with a corresponding increase in the effectiveness of the plan and number of relevant steps in the plan.</s><s>The present study reports the results of 103 persons with acquired brain injury who were randomly assigned to one of three 20-session analogy problem-solving skill training groups, namely: online training (through computer video conferencing with interactive software); computer-assisted training (through interactive patient-directed software); therapist administered training (face-to-face therapist guided training activities); and a \"no-treatment\" control group. Individuals' problem-solving skills and self-efficacy in all four groups were assessed over a four-week period. The statistically significantly improvement in problem solving skills in the online-group suggests that this approach could effectively improve cognitive functions of person with ABI and yield training outcomes comparable to other modes of delivery such as the face-to-face training. The conceptualization and applicability of tele-cognitive rehabilitation, its implications for persons with ABI, and future studies in this research area are also discussed.</s><s>This study was designed to evaluate the remediating effects of two types of aid on a test of switching attention administered to patients with acquired brain injury (ABI). The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) performance of 24 patients with ABI assigned to three treatment groups (no treatment, external inhibition, increased stimulus salience) was compared to normal controls. The pattern of results supports the separation of functions in switching attention suggested by a neural network model, and establishes minimal aids necessary for remediating deficits associated with ABI.</s><s>Adjunctive restorative therapies administered during the first few months after stroke, the period with the greatest degree of spontaneous recovery, reduce the number of stroke patients with significant disability. We hypothesized that patients who received escitalopram would show improved performance in neuropsychological tests assessing memory and executive functions than patients who received placebo or underwent Problem Solving Therapy. One hundred twenty-nine patients were treated within 3 months following stroke. The 12-month trial included 3 arms: a double-blind placebo-controlled comparison of escitalopram (n = 43) with placebo (n = 45), and a nonblinded arm of Problem Solving Therapy (n = 41). This beneficial effect of escitalopram was independent of its effect on depression. The utility of antidepressants in the process of poststroke recovery should be further investigated.</s><s>Two studies assessed the effects of a training procedure (Goal Management Training, GMT), derived from Duncan's theory of goal neglect, on disorganized behavior following TBI. GMT, but not motor skills training, was associated with significant gains on everyday paper-and-pencil tasks designed to mimic tasks that are problematic for patients with goal neglect. These studies provide both experimental and clinical support for the efficacy of GMT toward the treatment of executive functioning deficits that compromise independence in patients with brain damage.</s><s>To examine the effects of an awareness training protocol embedded within the practice of instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) in participants with acquired brain injury on levels of self-awareness and functional performance. This study used a randomized control trial design: 10 participants with moderate-to-severe brain injury received six sessions of the self-awareness training while they performed IADLs (experimental group) and 10 participants performed the same IADLs but received conventional therapeutic practice (control group). Pre- and post-intervention outcome measures taken from the two groups were compared. Assessment of Awareness of Disability) and Self-Regulation Skills Inventory (SRSI). Compared to the control group, the intervention significantly improved IADL performances and self-regulation. The self-awareness intervention significantly but selectively improved self-awareness during IADL task performance as well as functional performance.</s><s>We investigated the effects of an explicit problem-solving skills training program using a metacomponential approach with 33 outpatients with moderate acquired brain injury, in the Hong Kong context. We found significant advantages for the experimental group on the Metacomponential Interview measure in association with the explicit metacomponential training, but transfer to the real-life problem-solving measures was not evidenced in statistically significant findings. Small sample size, limited time of intervention, and some limitations with these tools may have been contributing factors to these results.</s><s>To examine the effects of a compensatory intervention versus a remedial intervention for deficits in visual processing of adults with acquired brain injuries (ABI). A cognitive rehabilitation program at a large comprehensive rehabilitation hospital in the New York City metropolitan area. The compensatory intervention consisted of four 45-minute sessions of instruction in the use of three internal compensatory strategies, including verbalization, chunking, and pacing. Both groups exhibited statistically significant improvement of comparable degree on posttests and weekly measures. Those who used strategies demonstrated better performance than those who did not. The ability to use internal compensatory strategies may be a significant confound in research examining the effects of the various cognitive rehabilitation intervention methods.</s><s>To develop and evaluate a systematic intervention programme for the management of impaired self-awareness (ISD) in people with traumatic brain injury. Twenty-one patients with traumatic brain injury were randomly assigned to an experimental group and a control group according to their admission sequence. Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks Tests were conducted to compare the within-group changes of the outcome measures of the Self-Awareness of Deficits Interview (SADI), the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) and the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Score (Lawton IADL) in the control and experimental groups. After AIP training, the participants in the experimental group demonstrated significant improvement in their level of awareness as compared to the control group. This new programme can be further developed to extend a better carryover treatment effect to functional improvement in daily activities.</s><s>To examine the effects of working memory (WM) training in adult patients with stroke. The intervention consisted of computerized training on various WM tasks for five weeks. Statistically significant training effects were found on the non-trained tests for WM and attention, i.e., tests that measure related cognitive functions but are not identical to tasks in the training programme (Span board p < 0.05; PASAT p < 0.001; Ruff 2&7 p < 0.005).</s><s>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a principal cause of death and disability in young adults. Rehabilitation for TBI has not received the same level of scientific scrutiny for efficacy and cost-efficiency that is expected in other medical fields. Single-center, parallel-group, randomized trial conducted from January 1992 through February 1997 at a US military medical referral center. Patients were randomly assigned to an intensive, standardized, 8-week, in-hospital cognitive rehabilitation program (n=67) or a limited home rehabilitation program with weekly telephone support from a psychiatric nurse (n=53). At 1-year follow-up, there was no significant difference between patients who had received the intensive in-hospital cognitive rehabilitation program vs the limited home rehabilitation program in return to employment (90% vs 94%, respectively; P=.51; difference, 4% [95% confidence interval ¿CI¿, -5% to 14%]) or fitness for duty (73% vs 66%, respectively; P=. These findings emphasize the importance of conducting randomized trials to evaluate TBI rehabilitation interventions.</s><s>A multicenter randomized control trial (RCT) was conducted to evaluate the effects of a treatment for dysexecutive problems after acquired brain injury (ABI) on daily life functioning. Seventy-five ABI patients were randomly allocated to either the experimental treatment, multifaceted strategy training for executive dysfunction, or a control treatment, computerized cognitive function training. The primary outcome measure, the Role Resumption List (RRL), and two other follow-up measures, the Treatment Goal Attainment (TGA) and the Executive Secretarial Task (EST), were indications of daily life executive functioning. We conclude that our treatment has resulted in significant improvements of executive functioning in daily life, lasting at least 6 months post-treatment.</s><s>To evaluate the effectiveness of comprehensive, holistic neuropsychologic (NP) rehabilitation compared with standard, multidisciplinary rehabilitation for people with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Postacute brain injury rehabilitation center within a suburban rehabilitation hospital. Sixty-eight participants who met inclusion criteria were randomly allocated to treatment conditions. Standard neurorehabilitation consisted primarily of individual, discipline specific therapies (n=34). Standard neurorehabilitation participants showed improved productivity at the 6-month follow-up associated with the need for continued rehabilitation. The results show the effectiveness of comprehensive holistic NP rehabilitation for improving community functioning and quality of life after TBI compared with standard rehabilitation.</s>"

Of 208 patients with first episode of unilateral stroke admitted to the authors' rehabilitation center, 48 patients with CRPSt1 of the affected upper limb were enrolled in a randomized controlled study, with a 6-month follow-up, and assigned to either a mirror therapy group or placebo control group. The secondary end points were improvement in motor function as assessed by the Wolf Motor Function Test and Motor Activity Log. The mean scores of both the primary and secondary end points significantly improved in the mirror group (P < .001). Moreover, statistically significant differences after treatment (P < .001) and at the 6-month follow-up were found between the 2 groups.</s><s>Mirror therapy for chronic complex regional pain syndrome type 1 and stroke.</s><s>This randomized controlled trial evaluated the therapeutic benefit of mental practice with motor imagery in stroke patients with persistent upper limb motor weakness. There is evidence to suggest that mental rehearsal of movement can produce effects normally attributed to practising the actual movements. Current efficacy evidence for mental practice with motor imagery in stroke is insufficient due to methodological limitations. The primary outcome measure was a blinded rating on the Action Research Arm test. In light of the evidence, it remains to be seen whether mental practice with motor imagery is a valid rehabilitation technique in its own right.</s><s>Rehabilitation of hemiparesis after stroke with a mirror.</s><s>To evaluate the effects of mirror therapy on upper-extremity motor recovery, spasticity, and hand-related functioning of inpatients with subacute stroke. Randomized, controlled, assessor-blinded, 4-week trial, with follow-up at 6 months. In our group of subacute stroke patients, hand functioning improved more after mirror therapy in addition to a conventional rehabilitation program compared with a control treatment immediately after 4 weeks of treatment and at the 6-month follow-up, whereas mirror therapy did not affect spasticity.</s><s>To evaluate for any clinical effects of home-based mirror therapy and subsequent cortical reorganization in patients with chronic stroke with moderate upper extremity paresis. Both groups trained once a week under supervision of a physiotherapist at the rehabilitation center and practiced at home 1 hour daily, 5 times a week. The grip force, spasticity, pain, dexterity, hand-use in daily life, and quality of life at baseline-posttreatment and at 6 months-were all measured by a blinded assessor. Changes in neural activation patterns were assessed with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at baseline and posttreatment in an available subgroup (mirror, 12; control, 9). Posttreatment, the FMA improved more in the mirror than in the control group (3.6 ± 1.5, P < .05), but this improvement did not persist at follow-up.</s><s>To investigate the synergic effects of mirror therapy and neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) for hand function in stroke patients. Twenty patients had NMES applied and simultaneously underwent mirror therapy. Twenty patients had NMES applied only, and twenty patients underwent mirror therapy only. Each treatment was done five days per week, 30 minutes per day, for three weeks. The mirror and NMES group showed significant improvements in the Fugl-Meyer scores of hand, wrist, coordination and power of hand extension compared to the other groups. Therefore, a hand rehabilitation strategy combined with NMES and mirror therapy may be more helpful for improving hand function in stroke patients than NMES or mirror therapy only.</s><s>Rehabilitation of the severely affected paretic arm after stroke represents a major challenge, especially in the presence of sensory impairment. To evaluate the effect of a therapy that includes use of a mirror to simulate the affected upper extremity with the unaffected upper extremity early after stroke. In the subgroup of 25 patients with distal plegia at the beginning of the therapy, MT patients regained more distal function than CT patients. Furthermore, across all patients, MT improved recovery of surface sensibility. MT early after stroke is a promising method to improve sensory and attentional deficits and to support motor recovery in a distal plegic limb.</s><s>To evaluate the effects of mirror therapy, using motor imagery training, on lower-extremity motor recovery and motor functioning of patients with subacute stroke.

Cases and controls were matched by age alone or by age and scores for confounders (comorbidity and indicators of NSAID use). Up to five controls were matched to each of 616 cases by age and 565 cases by age and confounder scores.

To quantify associations with PD for the individual, two-way and three-way combinations of these factors, a case-control association study with 1,186 PD patients and 928 controls was conducted. Subjects completed a structured questionnaire regarding smoking, coffee, and NSAID consumption. Smoking, coffee, and over the counter NSAID use as individual factors exhibited significantly reduced risks of 20% to 30%.

Results were combined in a meta-analysis with those of published prospective investigations. There was a dose-response relationship between tablets of ibuprofen taken per week and PD risk (p trend = 0.01).

Associations between PD and environmental measures (history, status, dosage, duration, and intensity) of smoking, coffee, caffeine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and non-aspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were examined using generalized estimating equations with an independent correlation matrix while controlling for age and sex. Individuals with PD were significantly less likely to report ever smoking (odds ratio = 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.41-0.78).

Prospective cohorts of 44 057 men and 98 845 women free of PD, stroke, or cancer (Health Professionals Follow-up Study, 1986-2000, and Nurses' Health Study, 1980-1998). Compared with nonusers, a nonsignificantly lower risk of PD was also observed among men and women who took 2 or more tablets of aspirin per day (relative risk, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.26-1.21).</s><s>Markers of neuroinflammation, including activated microglia and increased levels of circulating proinflammatory cytokines, have been observed in the brains and CSF of patients with Parkinson disease (PD). Yet the link between anti-inflammatory agents and PD in humans remains uncertain, despite indications that neuroinflammation may contribute to cell death in the PD brain and experimental evidence of anti-inflammatory agents such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) exerting neuroprotective effects in animal models. Our data suggested a decreased risk of PD among regular (>or=2 pills/week for at least 1 month) aspirin NSAID users (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.15).

They were randomized to rosuvastatin (20 mg/d, n = 100) or placebo (n = 100) starting 1 week before the operation. Electrocardiography and echocardiography were performed before and after the operation. The percentages of marker level increase indicative of myocardial disease were determined in the placebo versus statin groups and were as follows: troponin I, 35% versus 65% (P < .0001); myoglobin, 39% versus 72% (P < .0001); creatine kinase-MB mass, 22% versus 40% (P = .0002). In high-risk patients myocardial disease was observed more frequently but significantly less in statin-pretreated patients.</s><s>Cardiopulmonary bypass is associated with a complex systemic inflammatory response and the extent of their increase has been correlated with the development of postoperative complications. Therefore, we investigated the effects of preoperative simvastatin treatment on systemic inflammatory response and perioperative morbidity after cardiopulmonary bypass. Cytokine levels were measured by enzyme-linked assays from plasma samples obtained at specific time points pre- and post-operation. The preoperative and postoperative course did not differ between both groups. In patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass, the administration of simvastatin doses not produce any changes in the inflammatory response as measured by the levels of IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha and SIRS score, nor does it reduce the complications after cardiac surgery.</s><s>P-selectin is an adhesion molecule that plays a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. There was less use of intraoperative inotropic agents in the fluvastatin group ( P < 0.015) and the difference in the length of ICU and hospital stay showed a significantly shorter stay for the fluvastatin group. Pretreatment with fluvastatin seemed to reduce P-selectin levels compared to patients given placebo, and hence, we think that pretreatment with a statin, fluvastatin in our study, might reduce the perioperative cardiac injury caused by cardiopulmonary bypass-induced inflammatory changes. We believe that routine preoperative use of fluvastatin should be carefully considered.</s><s>Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are a subtype of hematopoietic stem cells, which contribute to the repair of injured endothelium. We conducted a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-way crossover trial in 50 patients undergoing elective coronary surgery. The atorvastatin group showed a significantly higher amount of EPCs both pre- and postoperatively compared with the placebo, with a >4-fold increase compared with the baseline values. Statin did not affect levels of SDF-1alpha, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor. However, no correlation was found between plasma levels of any cytokine and number of EPCs, with the exception of SDF-1alpha.</s><s>Atrial fibrillation (AF) after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is still the most common postoperative arrhythmic complication. Previous studies report that patients undergoing preoperative statin therapy had a lower incidence of postoperative AF. The 140 consecutive patients undergoing elective off-pump CABG, without a history of AF or previous statin treatment, were enrolled and randomly assigned to a statin (atorvastatin 20 mg/day, n=71) or a control group (placebo, n=69) starting 7 days preoperatively. Atorvastatin significantly reduced the incidence of postoperative AF and the postoperative peak C-reactive protein (CRP) level vs placebo (14% vs 34%, P=0.009; 126.5 +/-22.3 vs 145.2 +/-31.6 mg/L, P<0.0001).</s><s>Systemic inflammatory response occurs frequently after coronary artery bypass surgery, and it is strongly correlated with the risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality. Therefore, we investigated the effects of preoperative atorvastatin treatment on systemic inflammatory response and perioperative morbidity after cardiopulmonary bypass. Forty patients were randomized to treatment with atorvastatin (20 mg/day, group A, n=20) or placebo (group B, n=20) 3 wks before surgery. Postoperative serum levels of both interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 increased significantly over baseline, but the peak levels observed 4 hrs postoperatively were significantly lower in the atorvastatin group. In the same fashion, CD11b expression on neutrophils was significantly lower in the statin group at 4 and 24 hrs postoperatively.</s><s>Atrial fibrillation (AF) after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery is still the most common arrhythmic complication. This study evaluated whether pretreatment with atorvastatin protects against AF after off-pump CABG. One hundred twenty-four patients without a history of AF or previous statin use, who were scheduled to undergo elective off-pump CABG, were enrolled. The incidence of AF was significantly lower in the atorvastatin group than in the control group (13% vs 27%, P = .04). Higher postoperative peak N-terminus pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels were associated with the development of postoperative AF (odds ratio 1.02 per 100 pg/mL, P = .03).</s><s>In addition to lowering lipid levels, statins might reduce leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions. Pre- and post-CPB blood samples were assayed for neutrophil CD11b surface adhesion molecule and oxidative burst. Plasma levels of interleukins 6 and 8, P-selectin, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and lactoferrin were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Postoperative clinical outcomes did not differ either between the two groups. These data show that acute preoperative statin therapy fails to limit the inflammatory response to CPB; however, the data also document a major upregulation of NF-kappaB during cardiac operations, thereby providing a sound rationale for interventions targeted at inactivating this key component of the inflammatory cascade.</s><s>While statins are increasingly used in cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), the anti-inflammatory effects of individual statins, within the context of various treatment regimes, need further examination. Forty three patients undergoing CPB were enrolled in a randomized, prospective clinical study. Patients in the pravastatin group received one dose of 40 mg per day for nine days, starting 48 hours before CPB, with an additional dose of 40 mg one hour after surgery. Plasma levels of selected inflammatory mediators were measured at baseline and tracked systematically. Pravastatin reduced postoperative interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels significantly at 24 and 48 hours, and at seven days.

Patients were randomized to atorvastatin (40 mg/d, n=101) or placebo (n=99) starting 7 days before operation. The primary end point was incidence of postoperative AF; secondary end points were length of stay, 30-day major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events, and postoperative C-reactive protein (CRP) variations. Atorvastatin significantly reduced the incidence of AF versus placebo (35% versus 57%, P=0.003). Multivariable analysis showed that atorvastatin treatment conferred a 61% reduction in risk of AF (odds ratio 0.39, 95% confidence interval 0.18 to 0.85, P=0.017), whereas high postoperative CRP levels were associated with increased risk (odds ratio 2.0, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 7.0, P=0.01). Treatment with atorvastatin 40 mg/d, initiated 7 days before surgery, significantly reduces the incidence of postoperative AF after elective cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass and shortens hospital stay. These results may influence practice patterns with regard to adjuvant pharmacological therapy before cardiac surgery.</s>"

        "Abstracts": "<s>Disturbances of serotonergic neurotransmission appear to be particularly important for the pathophysiology of winter depression. A randomized, parallel design was used with rater and patients blind to treatment conditions. One week of placebo (phase I) was followed by 5 weeks of treatment (phase II) with fluoxetine (20 mg per day) and a placebo light condition versus bright light (3000 lux, 2 h per day) and a placebo drug. Forty patients entered phase II and 35 completed it (one drop-out in the fluoxetine group and four in the bright light group). Light therapy improved HDRS scores significantly faster, while fluoxetine had a faster effect on atypical symptoms. An apparently better response to bright light requires confirmation in a larger sample.</s><s>Light therapy and antidepressants have shown comparable efficacy in separate studies of seasonal affective disorder treatment, but few studies have directly compared the two treatments. This double-blind, randomized, controlled trial was conducted in four Canadian centers over three winter seasons. Light treatment was applied for 30 minutes/day in the morning with a fluorescent white-light box; placebo light boxes used neutral density filters. There were also no differences between the light and fluoxetine treatment groups in clinical response rates (67% for each group) or remission rates (50% and 54%, respectively). Post hoc testing found that light-treated patients had greater improvement at 1 week but not at other time points. Fluoxetine was associated with greater treatment-emergent adverse events (agitation, sleep disturbance, palpitations), but both treatments were generally well-tolerated with no differences in overall number of adverse effects.</s><s>The authors investigated the efficacy and safety of fluoxetine in the treatment of winter seasonal affective disorder. Sixty-eight outpatients who met the DSM-III-R criteria for recurrent major depressive episodes, seasonal (winter) pattern, were randomly assigned to 5 weeks of treatment with fluoxetine, 20 mg/day (N = 36), or placebo (N = 32). Clinical response was defined as a greater than 50% reduction in depression score between baseline and study termination. The fluoxetine group had lower depression scores at termination than the placebo group, but these differences did not achieve statistical significance. On the basis of clinical response rate, fluoxetine appears to be an effective, well-tolerated treatment for seasonal affective disorder.</s><s>The monoaminergic neurotransmitters serotonin and noradrenaline have both been implicated in the pathogenesis of seasonal affective disorder (SAD). However, the differential therapeutic value of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (NARI) in SAD has not been assessed until now. This study compares data from two open-label trials with similar methodology investigating the SSRI escitalopram and the NARI reboxetine. The response rate (SIGH-SAD <50% of baseline value) and the remission rate (SIGH-SAD <8) were not significantly different after 6 weeks of treatment, but the time to response and to remission was significantly shorter in the reboxetine group. The number and severity of side effects were higher in patients treated with reboxetine at all time points. Thus escitalopram and reboxetine were equally effective in treating SAD on all primary and secondary outcome measures.</s><s>The aim of this observational study was to evaluate the effects of duloxetine in the treatment of seasonal affective disorder (SAD). 26 SAD patients were treated with open-label duloxetine 60-120 mg per day over 8 weeks. Ratings included the Structured Interview Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (SAD version; SIGH-SAD) and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI). To estimate treatment effects on social functioning in SAD we employed the Social Adaptation Self Evaluation Scale (SASS), the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), and assessments of days lost due to illness and days with reduction in productivity.</s><s>The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of escitalopram in the treatment of seasonal affective disorder (SAD, fall-winter depression). Patients were treated with open-label escitalopram at a dosage of 10 to 20 mg per day. From week 2 onwards, escitalopram significantly reduced SIGH-SAD score and CGI severity score (p<0.001). These results suggest that escitalopram is an efficacious and altogether safe treatment for seasonal depression.</s>"

Most of them pointed out there was no difference in survival between residual disease of 0.1-1 cm (R1) and >1 cm (R2). The aim of this study was to evaluate survival benefits from cytoreduction to R1. The median survival and estimated 5-year survival for patients with R1 were 31.1 months and 23.9%, and there were significant differences in survival when compared to 15.6 months and 6.4% in R2 (chi(2) = 7.45, P = 0.006), 63.2 months (mean survival) and 54.4% in complete cytoreduction (chi(2) = 8.93, P = 0.0028). Complete secondary cytoreduction is the strongest survival determinant in recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer, whereas patients with residual disease of 0.1-1 cm may also benefit from secondary cytoreduction.</s><s>This study examined the impact of secondary cytoreductive surgery on survival of patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian carcinoma. Multivariate analysis determined which variables influenced the cytoreductive outcome and survival. The probability of complete cytoreduction was influenced by the largest size of recurrent tumor (< 10 cm ¿90.0% vs. > 10 cm ¿66.7%; P = 0.003), use of salvage chemotherapy before secondary surgery (chemotherapy given ¿64.3% vs. chemotherapy not given ¿93.8%; P = 0.001), and preoperative Gynecologic Oncology Group performance status (0 ¿100%, 1 ¿91.4%, 2 ¿82.4%, and 3 ¿47.4%; P = 0.001). The authors believe a randomized trial should be initiated to confirm these findings.</s><s>This study was undertaken to evaluate the role of secondary cytoreduction in patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer. Multivariable analysis revealed 3 factors to be significant: optimal cytoreduction during primary (P = .003, odds ratio [OR]: 0.30; 95% CI: 0.14-0.66), secondary cytoreduction (P = .04, OR: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.22-0.99), and the endometrioid histologic type (P = .005, OR: 0.09; 95% CI: 0.02-0.48). Further prospective randomized series are needed to determine specific recommendations.</s><s>The value of secondary cytoreductive surgery is still controversial, especially in patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer. Between 1986 and 1997, 60 patients who received primary cytoreductive surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy for stage III and IV epithelial ovarian cancer experienced disease recurrence at least 6 months after completion of primary therapy, and secondary surgical cytoreduction was performed. The Cox proportional regression model and Logistic stepwise regression were used in statistical processing of the data. The median progression-free interval between the two operations was 13 months (range, 6-56 months). There was a significant difference in survival between patients who were optimally cytoreduced compared to those suboptimally cytoreduced, with an estimated median survival in the optimal group of 19 months vs. 8 months in the suboptimal group (chi(2) = 22.04, P = 0.0000). Prognosis of survival for individuals with progression-free interval >12 months was better than that of those with the interval </=12 months (chi(2) = 5.22, P = 0.0224). Patients with ascites at disease recurrence, however, were not suitable for aggressive secondary surgery, and redebulking surgery for those with residual disease of >1.0 cm after primary operation should be considered prudently.</s><s>The benefit of cytoreductive surgery for patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer has not been defined clearly. The objective of this study was to identify prognostic factors for survival in patients who underwent secondary cytoreduction for recurrent, platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian cancer and to establish generally applicable guidelines and selection criteria. Potential prognostic factors were evaluated in univariate and multivariate analyses. In total, 157 patients underwent secondary cytoreduction, and 153 of those patients were evaluable. For patients who had a single site of recurrence, the median survival was 60 months compared with 42 months for patients who had multiple sites of recurrence and 28 months for patients who had carcinomatosis (P <.001). On multivariate analysis, disease-free interval (P = .004), the number of recurrence sites (P = .01), and residual disease (P <.001) were significant prognostic factors.</s><s>The aim of this study was to investigate the benefit of secondary cytoreduction (SCR) in the first relapse in epithelial ovarian cancer and to attempt to define selection criteria for SCR. MST was 4.5 versus 0.7 years for 0 versus>2 cm residual disease, respectively. Residual disease after SCR, treatment-free interval (TFI) and age were found to be prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) in multivariate analysis. Localised tumour was found to be the only significant factor to predict COC.</s><s>The role of cytoreductive surgery in relapsed ovarian cancer is not clearly defined. Therefore, patient selection remains arbitrary and depends on the center's preference rather than on established selection criteria. The Descriptive Evaluation of preoperative Selection KriTeria for OPerability in recurrent OVARian cancer (DESKTOP OVAR) trial was undertaken to form a hypothesis for a panel of criteria for selecting patients who might benefit from surgery in relapsed ovarian cancer. Twenty-five member institutions of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Gynaekologische Onkologie Ovarian Committee (AGO OC) and AGO-OVAR boards collected data on their patients with cytoreductive surgery for relapsed invasive epithelial ovarian cancer performed in 2000-2003. Complete resection was associated with significantly longer survival compared with surgery leaving any postoperative residuals [median 45.2 vs. 19.7 months; hazard ratio (HR) 3.71; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.27-6.05; P < .0001].

Between June 1993 and June 1999, 149 patients after primary treatment underwent secondary cytoreductive surgery: 69 (46.3%) had recurrence-free interval (RFI) 7-12 months, 59 (39.6%) RFI 13-24 months, and 21 (14.1%) RFI >24 months. According to multivariate analysis, RFI groups, prior chemotherapy combination, and residual tumor after secondary surgery were associated independently with overall survival. The 2-year survival rates were 22.3, 62.9, and 22.7%, respectively, for patients with RFI 7-12, 13-24, and >24 months. Unexpectedly, RFI >24 months was not correlated significantly with overall survival.</s><s>The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of secondary cytoreductive surgery in the outcome of patients who had recurrent epithelial ovarian carcinoma that was limited to <or=5 recurrence sites within the abdomen or pelvis on preoperative imaging studies and attempt to define selection criteria associated with improved survival, with specific attention to the number of lesions suspicious for recurrent disease. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the effect of clinicopathologic variables on overall postrecurrence survival. The median patient age at recurrence was 57.7 years, and the median diagnosis-to-recurrence interval was 32 months (range, 12-164 months). : The current data supported the definition of localized recurrent ovarian cancer as patients with 1 or 2 radiographic recurrence sites.</s>"

We aimed to establish whether M pilosula venom immunotherapy (VIT) prevents lifethreatening sting anaphylaxis in otherwise healthy adults. Participants were randomly allocated either immunotherapy, in accordance with the semirush hyposensitisation regimen, or placebo. The primary endpoint was systemic reaction after a deliberate sting challenge. Four on placebo were stopped early and 12 on VIT had their treatment allocations revealed before the sting challenge, thus 29 on placebo and 23 on VIT were included in the primary analysis. Objectively defined systemic reactions to sting challenges arose in 21 of 29 participants (72%) on placebo (8 reactions were associated with hypotension) and none of 23 on VIT (p<0.0001).</s><s>Insect hypersensitivity is currently treated by immunization using whole-body extracts. Placebo and whole-body extract gave similar results and were significantly less effective than venom immunotherapy (P less than 0.01). The 14 patients with failure of treatment with whole-body extract and placebo were subsequently provided with venom immunotherapy; one reacted to a subsequent sting. We conclude that venom immunotherapy is clinically superior to therapy on whole-body extract or placebo.</s><s>In many European centers insect venom allergic patients with a reaction confined to the skin are only offered an epinephrine auto-injector and not venom immunotherapy (VIT). Previously we showed that VIT improves health-related quality of life (HRQL) of yellow jacket allergic patients with more than dermal reactions. Patients with solely dermal reactions were asked if they were willing to be randomized either to VIT or EpiPen, after receiving patient information. Before and 1 year after enrollment, patients completed the Vespid allergy Quality of Life Questionnaire (VQLQ), Burden of Treatment and Expectation of Outcome. Of 55 patients eligible for the study, 29 consented to randomization: 15 to VIT, 14 to EpiPen. Dermal reactors did not consider VIT burdensome and rated this treatment as being superior to the EpiPen. Prescription of an EpiPen in patients not choosing this treatment is associated with deterioration in HRQL and should therefore be avoided as definitive treatment in these patients.</s><s>Large local reactions to insect stings cause significant morbidity and impair quality of life. Sting challenge was repeated after 7 to 11 weeks (control patients then began venom immunotherapy), and annually for as long as 4 years. After 7 to 11 weeks of treatment, the size and duration of large local reactions decreased 42% and 53%, respectively, in treated patients and 18% in controls (P < .01 for both). The response was similar after 1 year, and improved after 2 to 4 years to 60% and 70%, respectively. Further studies are needed to establish the safety and efficacy of venom immunotherapy for large local reactions, the optimal duration of treatment, and the mechanism for the differences in degree and rate of clinical response compared with venom immunotherapy in systemic reactors.</s><s>Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) proved effective and safe in respiratory allergy, and thus its use in hymenoptera allergy can be hypothesized. We sought to assess, in a proof-of-concept study, whether SLIT might potentially be beneficial in hymenoptera allergy. We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving patients with LLRs who were monosensitized to honeybee. After the baseline sting challenge, they were randomized to either SLIT or placebo for 6 months. Thirty patients (18 male patients; mean age, 44.5 years) were enrolled, and 26 completed the study, with 1 dropout in the active group and 3 dropouts in the placebo group. Although LLRs are not an indication for immunotherapy, this proof-of-concept study suggests that SLIT in hymenoptera allergy deserves further investigation.</s><s>The treatment of patients allergic to insect stings with insect-venom injections has been shown to be 97 percent effective in reducing the risk of sting-induced anaphylaxis. Each child had a positive skin-test reaction to one or more of five hymenopteran venoms. The results of accidental stings during four years of observation were evaluated. In the treated group, 84 stings in 36 patients resulted in one systemic reaction (1.2 percent of stings). In contrast, 196 stings in 86 untreated children resulted in 18 systemic reactions (9.2 percent of stings, P less than 0.001). Sixteen of these 18 reactions were judged to be milder than the patient's reaction to the first sting, 2 were similar in severity, and none were more severe. These data confirm that immunotherapy with insect venom prevents recurrences of systemic reactions after subsequent insect stings.</s>"

Disability was assessed before, after fifth sessions, and then after 1, 2, 3 and 12 months. Cortical excitability was assessed for both hemispheres before and after the second and fifth sessions. This was because real rTMS produced greater improvement than sham that was evident even at one year follow-up.</s><s>The authors investigated the use of slow-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the unaffected hemisphere to decrease interhemispheric inhibition of the lesioned hemisphere and improve motor function in patients within 12 months of a stroke.</s><s>To study the effect of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on the rehabilitation of motor function in patients with cerebral infarction. Two hundred twenty and three patients with the initial attack of cerebral infarction were divided into three groups. (3) Forty patients aged 56 approximately 75 were further divided into two subgroups according to the timing of beginning of TMS: subgroup with TMS beginning within 3 months after the initial attack (n = 20) and subgroup with TMS beginning 3 months after the initial attack (n = 20). The effective rate was 90.5% in the rehabilitation subgroup and 68.3% in the control group (P < 0.05). The Fugl-Meyer scores were 36.3 +/- 15.8 and 33.7 +/- 13.7 in the rehabilitation subgroup and control subgroup before treatment respectively (P > 0.05), and were 51.7 +/- 15.7 and 40.0 +/- 13.9 after treatment respectively (P < 0.01). TMS is effective on the rehabilitation of motor function in patients with cerebral infarction. The effectiveness of TMS treatment depends on the age of the patients and timing of beginning treatment.</s><s>It has been recently shown that a single session of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the unaffected hemisphere can improve motor function in stroke patients; however, this improvement is short-lasting. Fifteen patients with chronic stroke were randomized to receive active or sham rTMS of the unaffected hemisphere. A blinded rater assessed motor function and corticospinal excitability at baseline, during and after 2 weeks of treatment. Active rTMS resulted in a significant improvement of the motor function performance in the affected hand that lasted for 2 weeks. There was a significant correlation between motor function improvement and corticospinal excitability change in the affected hemisphere. These results support and extend the findings of previous studies on rTMS in stroke patients because five consecutive sessions of rTMS increased the magnitude and duration of the motor effects. Furthermore, this increased dose of rTMS is not associated with cognitive adverse effects and/or epileptogenic activity.</s><s>To explore the efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and voluntary muscle contraction (VMC) to improve corticospinal transmission, muscle function, and purposeful movement early after stroke. n = 27, mean age 75 years, mean 27 days after middle cerebral artery infarct (24 subjects completed outcome measures). Treatment was given for the next 8 working days, and outcome was measured on day 10. In PlaceboVMC, subjects viewed pairs of drawings of upper limbs and reported their likeness. A positive trend for motor-evoked potential frequency was found for Real-rTMS + RealVMC, whereas a negative trend for motor-evoked potential frequency was found for Placebo-rTMS + PlaceboVMC.</s><s>There are a proportion of patients with poststroke depression (PSD) who do not respond to antidepressants. Patients completed a neuropsychological battery at baseline and after completing the protocol. This reduction was not influenced by patient's age, type or location of stroke, volume of left frontal leukoaraiosis or by the distance of the stimulating coil to the prefrontal cortex. However, there was a significant positive correlation between the percentage of reduction of Ham-D scores and frontal gray and white matter volumes. In addition, there were few and mild adverse effects that were equally distributed among groups. Taken together, these preliminary findings suggest that rTMS may be an effective and safe treatment alternative for patients with refractory depression and stroke.</s><s>The model of interhemispheric competition after stroke has been established for the upper but not for the lower extremity. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the brain has been shown to modulate cortical excitability. A total of 24 patients with average Fugl-Meyer lower limb scores of 17.88 ± 5.27 and average walking speeds of 63.81 ± 18.25 cm/s were randomized into an experimental group and a control group. Outcomes, including motor-evoked potential (MEP), lower-extremity Fugl-Meyer score, and gait performance, were measured before and after training. Decreased interhemispheric asymmetry of the amplitude of the MEP was noted after rTMS and task-oriented training. Motor control and walking ability were also significantly improved after rTMS and task-oriented training.</s><s>Recent reports demonstrated that low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the unaffected hemisphere improved the affected hand function in chronic stroke patients. We investigated whether 1 Hz rTMS improved the motor learning of the affected hand in patients after stroke. Moreover, the effect of motor training on pinch force was enhanced by rTMS (p < 0.001). These improvement in the motor function lasted for one week after rTMS and motor training (p < 0.001).Conclusion: rTMS improved the motor learning of the affected hand in patients after stroke; thus, it can apply as anew rehabilitation strategy for patients after stroke.</s><s>To investigate the long-term behavioral and neurophysiologic effects of combined time-locked repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and physical therapy (PT) intervention in chronic stroke patients with mild motor disabilities. Thirty patients were enrolled in a double-blind, randomized, single-center clinical trial. Patients received 10 daily sessions of 1 Hz rTMS over the intact motor cortex. In different groups, stimulation was either real (rTMS(R)) or sham (rTMS(S)) and was administered either immediately before or after PT. Treatment induced cumulative rebalance of excitability in the 2 hemispheres and a reduction of interhemispheric inhibition in the rTMS(R) groups. Classification of evidence: This interventional study provides Class I evidence that time-locked rTMS before or after physical therapy improves measures of dexterity and force in the affected limb in patients with chronic deficits more than 6 months poststroke.</s><s>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) or sham stimulation was given over the motor cortex daily for 10 days to two randomly assigned groups of 26 patients with acute ischemic stroke.</s><s>To test the potential adjuvant effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on motor learning in a group of stroke survivors undergoing constraint-induced therapy (CIT) for upper-limb hemiparesis. This was a prospective randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, parallel group study. Regardless of group assignment, participants demonstrated significant gains on the primary outcome measures: the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) and the Motor Activity Log (MAL)--Amount of Use, and on secondary outcome measures including the Box and Block Test (BBT) and the MAL--How Well. Participants receiving rTMS failed to show differential improvement on either primary outcome measure.</s><s>Cortico-cortical circuits originating from the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) of the intact left hemisphere (LH) may become hyperexcitable in patients with hemispatial neglect due to a right hemispheric (RH) stroke. Severity of neglect was assessed through the standardized Behavioral Inattention Test (BIT). BIT scores improved by 16.3% after 2 weeks of cTBS and 22.6% at 1 month follow-up. These findings suggest that a 2-week course of cTBS over the LH PPC may be a potential effective strategy in accelerating recovery from visuospatial neglect in subacute stroke patients, possibly counteracting the hyperexcitability of LH parieto-frontal circuits. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class III evidence that left posterior parietal cortex theta-burst stimulation improves hemispatial neglect for up to 2 weeks after treatment.</s><s>The purpose of this study was to compare the long-term effect of five daily sessions of 1 vs. 3 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on motor recovery in acute stroke. The patients were randomly assigned into one of three groups; the first and second groups received real rTMS; 1 and 3 Hz and third group received sham stimulation, daily for 5 days. Motor disability was assessed before and after the last session, and then after first, second and third month. No significant differences were found in basal rating scales between the three groups.</s><s>Although functional imaging studies suggest that recruitment of contralesional areas hinders optimal functional reorganization in patients with aphasic stroke, only limited evidence is available on the efficacy of noninvasive brain stimulation such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation aimed at suppression of contralateral overactivation. In this randomized, controlled, blinded pilot study, the effect of 1-Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over right-hemispheric Broca homolog in subjects with poststroke aphasia in the subacute stage was examined. At baseline, no group differences were discovered for age, laterality indices, or mean Aachen Aphasia Test scores. Four patients were lost to follow-up, but none due to side effects of the transcranial magnetic stimulation. Furthermore, the latter improved significantly clinically by a mean of 19.8 points in the Aachen Aphasia Test total score (P=0.002), whereas the control group did not. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation might be an effective, safe, and feasible complementary therapy for poststroke aphasia.</s><s>Arterial ischaemic stroke (AIS) can cause disabling hemiparesis in children. We aimed to test whether contralesional, inhibitory repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) could affect interhemispheric inhibition to improve hand function in chronic subcortical paediatric AIS. An occupational therapist did standardised tests of hand function at days 1 (baseline), 5, 10, and 17 (1 week post-treatment), and the primary outcomes were changes in grip strength and the Melbourne assessment of upper extremity function (MAUEF) between baseline and day 10. Ten patients with paediatric stroke were enrolled (median age 13.25 [IQR 10.08-16.78] years, mean time post-stroke 6.33 [SD 3.56] years): four with mild weakness, two with moderate weakness, and four with severe weakness. Day 10 MAUEF score improved by more in the rTMS group than in the sham group (7.25 [3.8] vs 0.79 [1.3] points greater than baseline; p=0.002), but this benefit did not persist to day 17.

Disimpaction on PEG + E was achieved in 58 (92%) of 63 of children (89% of 2-4 year olds and 94% of 5-11 year olds) without additional interventions. Seven children (23%) reimpacted whilst taking lactulose, whereas no children reimpacted while taking PEG + E (P = 0.011). PEG + E is safe and highly effective in the management of childhood constipation.</s><s>Recently, polyethylene glycol (PEG 3350) has been suggested as a good alternative laxative to lactulose as a treatment option in paediatric constipation. However, no large randomised controlled trials exist evaluating the efficacy of either laxative. One hundred patients (aged 6 months-15 years) with paediatric constipation were included in an eight week double blinded, randomised, controlled trial. After faecal disimpaction, patients <6 years of age received PEG 3350 (2.95 g/sachet) or lactulose (6 g/sachet) while children > or =6 years started with 2 sachets/day. Success was defined as a defecation frequency > or =3/week and encopresis < or =1 every two weeks. Secondary outcome measures were side effects after eight weeks of treatment. PEG 3350 (0.26 (0.11) g/kg), compared with lactulose (0.66 (0.32) g/kg), provided a higher success rate with fewer side effects.</s><s>Polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 and lactulose were compared in an unblinded, randomized, crossover design for treatment of constipation in 37 children aged 2 to 16 years.

There was a significant increase in BM (P < .001) and straining improvement (P < .05) with the different PEG3350 doses. Stool consistency improved significantly for doses 0.4 g/kg or higher (P < .001). This placebo-controlled study confirms the efficacy and safety of PEG3350 for the short-term treatment of children with functional constipation.</s><s>We hypothesized that enemas and polyethylene glycol (PEG) would be equally effective in treating rectal fecal impaction (RFI) but enemas would be less well tolerated and colonic transit time (CTT) would improve during disimpaction. During this period, the second CTT measurement was started and a child's behavior questionnaire was administered. Ninety-five patients were eligible, of whom 90 participated (male, n = 60; mean age: 7.5 +/- 2.8 years). Forty-six patients received enemas and 44 PEG, with 5 dropouts in each group. Fecal incontinence and watery stools were reported more frequently with PEG (P < .01), but defecation frequency (P = .64), abdominal pain (P = .33), and behavior scores were comparable between groups.

During follow-up, the 341 serodiscordant couples in which the index partner was not taking antiretroviral treatment had about 11 000 acts of intercourse without condoms, 50 natural pregnancies, and five HIV seroconversions (0.0004 per unprotected intercourse; 95% confidence interval 0.0001 to 0.0010); 294 of these couples always used condoms, accounting for about 42 000 acts of intercourse, 136 risk exposures from condom failure, and one HIV seroconversion. The heterosexual infectivity of HIV-1 in individuals taking effective antiretroviral treatment is low. Avoidance of unprotected intercourse and receipt of antiretroviral treatment by the infected partner in accordance with protocols are complementary measures to prevent HIV transmission.</s><s>High plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations are associated with increased risk of HIV-1 transmission. Participants in our prospective cohort analysis were from a randomised placebo-controlled trial that enrolled heterosexual African adults who were seropositive for both HIV-1 and herpes simplex virus type 2, and their HIV-1 seronegative partners. At enrolment, HIV-1 infected participants had CD4 counts of 250 cells per microL or greater and did not meet national guidelines for ART initiation; during 24 months of follow-up, CD4 counts were measured every 6 months and ART was initiated in accordance with national guidelines. We assessed rates of HIV-1 transmission by ART status of infected participants. In participants not on ART, the highest HIV-1 transmission rate (8.79 per 100 person-years) was from those with CD4 cell counts lower than 200 cells per microL. Low CD4 cell counts and high plasma HIV-1 concentrations might guide use of ART to achieve an HIV-1 prevention benefit.</s><s>OBJECTIVES: To estimate the HIV incidence and assess the behavioral, clinical, and quality-of-life risk factors for HIV transmission among serodiscordant couples from Henan Province, China. METHODS: Between January 2006 and December 2008, initially seronegative spouses were tested for HIV at six month intervals. Not always using condoms (RR=8.42; 95% CI, 4.83-14.67), sexual activity ≥ 4 times per month (RR=5.24; 95% CI, 2.55-10.77), not switching anti-retroviral treatment regimen (RR=1.99; 95% CI, 0.85-4.65), and a quality of life score <12 on the psychological domain (RR=2.33; 95% CI, 1.21-4.48) were associated with increased risk of seroconversion. There was no association between rate of HIV seroconversion and last recorded CD4 cell count level of the index spouse. CONCLUSIONS: Effective HIV prevention interventions targeting discordant couples should focus on sustaining health education, increasing psychosocial support services, and increasing medication adherence monitoring.</s><s>A cohort of 93 heterosexual HIV serodiscordant couples with no prior antiretroviral use were identified in a large referral center from February 2000 to January 2006 in southern Brazil. Median viral loads were used to compare transmitters versus nontransmitters (Mann-Whitney test). Sixty-seven (72%) index cases were female (49% identified during ante-natal care). Unprotected sexual intercourse as a risk factor for HIV-1 infection was significantly higher as compared to intravenous drug use (P < 0.0001) in female index partners but not in male index cases. Heterosexual transmission occurred more frequently from HIV-infected males to females (rate ratio 3.5; CI, 95% 0.8-16.5 P = 0.259), although without statistical significance, probably because of the small sample. ARV use may play a role in the prevention of HIV-1 heterosexual transmission. Other factors may be involved and should be further evaluated in larger cohorts.</s><s>To evaluate the impact of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on HIV-1 transmission rates among HIV-1 discordant couples in Rakai, Uganda. HIV-1 discordant couples were retrospectively identified between 2004 and 2009. Participants were offered voluntary counseling and testing and provided with risk reduction counseling. Free ART was offered to participants with a CD4 cell count of 250 cells/μl or less or WHO stage IV disease. In 32 couples in which the HIV-1 index partners started ART, no HIV-1 transmissions occurred during 53.6 person-years. The 95% CI for the incidence rate difference was -11.91 to -6.38 (P = 0.0097). Couples reported more consistent condom use during ART use, but there was no significant difference in the number of sexual partners or other risk behaviors.</s><s>To determine the incidence of heterosexual human immunodeficiency virus type 1 disease transmission and the effect of zidovudine therapy on this risk of transmission. At enrollment of the women, 50% of their infected partners had one or more signs of disease progression (symptoms of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, p24 antigen positivity, or CD4+ cell counts lower than 0.4 x 10(9)/L) and 15% were treated with zidovudine. Incidence rates of seroconversion were calculated and relative risks were estimated as incidence rate ratios. Twenty-seven women seroconverted during follow-up, and the incidence of seroconversion was 3.7 per 100 person-years. Behavioral counseling that encourages sexual practices with a lower risk of transmission remains the most important method of prevention.</s>"

This prospective randomized study evaluates the effect of GnRH agonist administered in the luteal phase on ICSI outcomes in both GnRH agonist- and GnRH antagonist-treated ovarian stimulation protocols. Administration of 0.1 mg of GnRH agonist triptorelin on day 6 after ICSI led to a significant improvement of implantation and live birth rates after ICSI as compared with placebo. Moreover, luteal-phase GnRH agonist administration increased luteal-phase serum HCG, estradiol and progesterone concentrations in both ovarian stimulation regimens. Luteal-phase GnRH agonist administration enhances ICSI clinical outcomes after GnRH agonist- and GnRH antagonist-treated ovarian stimulation cycles, possibly by a combination of effects on the embryo and the corpus luteum.</s><s>To compare the efficacy of Crinone vaginal gel and intramuscular progesterone (IMP) for luteal phase support in in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) with respect to pregnancy rates and outcomes, and to assess patient satisfaction with both products.

Its usefulness in detecting sputum smear and culture negative patients needs further study.</s><s>Participation criteria for clinical trials in pulmonary tuberculosis commonly include confirmation of sputum positive for mycobacteria and an indication of drug susceptibility before treatment is initiated. The methods detected mycobacteria or mycobacterial DNA in 96.8%, 90.5%, 92.9%, and 92.1% of samples, respectively. MTBDR, Xpert, and liquid culture were 100% concordant for detection of resistance to rifampin. Sensitivity and specificity of MTBDR for detection of isoniazid resistance were 83.3% and 100%, respectively. For quantification of mycobacterial sputum load, we found a correlation between Xpert DNA amplification cycle thresholds, time to positivity, and microscopy smear grade. We conclude that MTBDR and Xpert are suitable screening tools for determining rifampin resistance in sputum microscopy smear-positive patients before participation in tuberculosis trials.</s><s>A total of 217 specimens submitted for routine smear and culture from three different sites within the western United States were used to evaluate the GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay (for research use only) (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA).</s><s>The Xpert MTB/RIF (Cepheid) non-laboratory-based molecular assay has potential to improve the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB), especially in HIV-infected populations, through increased sensitivity, reduced turnaround time (2 h), and immediate identification of rifampicin (RIF) resistance. A single sputum sample underwent routine decontamination, AFB smear microscopy, liquid culture, and phenotypic drug susceptibility testing. Compared to liquid culture, the sensitivities of all the test methodologies, determined with a limited and potentially underpowered sample size (n = 177), were 59% (47%-71%) for smear microscopy, 76% (64%-85%) for MTBDRplus, 76% (64%-85%) for LCTB, and 86% (76%-93%) for Xpert MTB/RIF, with specificities all >97%. Xpert MTB/RIF detected four of these five cases (fifth case not tested) and two additional phenotypically sensitive cases. The Xpert MTB/RIF test has superior performance for rapid diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis over existing AFB smear microscopy and other molecular methodologies in an HIV- and TB-endemic region.

We aimed to assess operational feasibility, accuracy, and effectiveness of implementation in such settings. Patients were excluded from the main analyses if their second sputum sample was collected more than 1 week after the first sample, or if no valid reference standard or MTB/RIF test was available. We compared one-off direct MTB/RIF testing in nine microscopy laboratories adjacent to study sites with 2-3 sputum smears and 1-3 cultures, dependent on site, and drug-susceptibility testing. One-off MTB/RIF testing detected 933 (90·3%) of 1033 culture-confirmed cases of tuberculosis, compared with 699 (67·1%) of 1041 for microscopy. MTB/RIF test sensitivity was 76·9% in smear-negative, culture-positive patients (296 of 385 samples), and 99·0% specific (2846 of 2876 non-tuberculosis samples). Median time to detection of tuberculosis for the MTB/RIF test was 0 days (IQR 0-1), compared with 1 day (0-1) for microscopy, 30 days (23-43) for solid culture, and 16 days (13-21) for liquid culture.

Consecutive adult HIV-infected patients with no current TB diagnosis enrolling in an ART clinic in a South African township were recruited regardless of symptoms. They were clinically characterised and invited to provide two sputum samples at a single visit. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was cultured from 81 patients (TB prevalence, 17.3%).

Treatment failures included exacerbations in which symptoms did not resolve but no intervention was necessary, and those in which the patient's condition deteriorated so that intervention was necessary. Over 3.5 years in 173 patients, 362 exacerbations were treated, 180 with placebo and 182 with antibiotic. Peak flow recovered more rapidly with antibiotic treatment than with placebo.</s><s>Bacterial infections of the lower airways during an exacerbation in patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may be the cause of an exacerbation or the consequence of a viral infection or an increase in airways limitation. To determine whether bacterial infection is an important component in the pathogenesis of an exacerbation, the effects of antimicrobial treatment must be studied. Patients were instructed to contact their own physician early in the morning when complaints of increased shortness of breath, wheezing, or exacerbations of cough with or without sputum production occurred. Of 195 patients enrolled 71 (36%) contacted their physician for symptoms of an exacerbation.

Responder rate for frequency was significantly higher for topiramate versus placebo (63% vs 30%, P < .001), and versus lamotrigine (63% vs 46 %, P = .02).</s><s>Small open-label and controlled trials suggest that the antiepileptic drug topiramate is effective for migraine prevention. A 26-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted during outpatient treatment at 52 North American clinical centers. Topiramate was titrated by 25 mg/wk for 8 weeks to the assigned or maximum tolerated dose, whichever was less. The primary efficacy measure was change from baseline in mean monthly migraine frequency. Secondary efficacy measures included responder rate (proportion of patients with > or =50% reduction in monthly migraine frequency), reductions in mean number of monthly migraine days, severity, duration, and days a month requiring rescue medication, and adverse events. Mean monthly migraine frequency decreased significantly for patients receiving topiramate at 100 mg/d (-2.1, P =.008) and topiramate at 200 mg/d (-2.4, P<.001) vs placebo (-1.1). Rescue medication use was reduced in the 100-mg/d (P =.01) and 200-mg/d (P =.005) topiramate groups. Topiramate showed significant efficacy in migraine prevention within the first month of treatment, an effect maintained for the duration of the double-blind phase.</s><s>Topiramate (TPM) has shown efficacy in migraine prophylaxis in two large placebo-controlled, dose-ranging trials. Five hundred and seventy-five subjects were enrolled from 61 centres in 13 countries. TPM 100 mg/d was superior to placebo as measured by reduction in monthly migraine frequency, overall 50% responder rate, reduction in monthly migraine days, and reduction in the rate of daily rescue medication use. The TPM 100 mg/d and PROP groups were similar with respect to reductions in migraine frequency, responder rate, migraine days, and daily rescue medication usage.</s><s>Recent theories about migraine pathogenesis have outlined an abnormal central processing of sensory signals, also suggested by an abnormal pattern of EEG hyper-synchronization under visual stimulation. The aim of the present study was to test the efficacy of topiramate and levetiracetam vs placebo in a double blind project observing the effects of the three treatments on the EEG synchronization in the alpha band under sustained flash stimulation. Both levetiracetam and topiramate significantly decreased migraine frequency, compared with placebo. The phase synchronization index separates the two stages, before and after the treatment, only for levetiracetam, at stimulus frequencies of 9, 18, 24 and 27 Hz. An abnormal alpha band synchronization under visual stimuli was confirmed in migraine; this phenomenon was reversed by levetiracetam preventive treatment.</s><s>To assess the efficacy and safety of low-dose topiramate in migraine prophylaxis vs propranolol. Results - The topiramate group showed a reduction in the mean (+/-SD) of monthly migraine frequency from 6.07 (+/-1.89) to 1.83 (+/-1.39) episodes per month, headache intensity from 7.1 (+/-1.45) to 3.67 (+/-2.1) based on the Visual Analog Scale, and headache duration from 16.37 (+/-7.26) to 6.23 (+/-5.22) hours (P < 0.001). However, compared with propranolol, low-dose topiramate showed better results.</s><s>The present study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of low-dose topiramate and compare it with sodium valproate that is prevalently prescribed as a migraine prophylaxis. This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group clinical trial on 56 patients who completed the course of study. Topiramate and valproate were administered at 50 mg/day and 400 mg/day, respectively, during the follow-up period. Frequency, intensity, duration, associated symptoms with headaches, analgesics use, as well as drugs' side effects were studied. The reduction of headache severity in the topiramate group was significantly more than that in the valproate group (p = .027).</s><s>The objective of this study was to observe the efficacy, safety, and side effects of a combination of flunarizine plus topiramate compared with either flunarizine and or toparamate alone for migraine prophylaxis. Out of 150 patients with migraine recruited into the study and randomly assigned to one of three conditions, 126 completed the trial in their group: flunarizine (39), topiramate (44), and flunarizine plus topiramate (43). Patient information was assessed at enrollment and at follow-up visits at the end of months 1-3, 6, 9, and 12. The primary measure of efficacy reduction in mean monthly migraine frequency of at least 50% as compared with baseline. Secondary efficacy parameters included reduction in mean monthly migraine days and severity of headache. Topiramate was associated with a mean weight loss was of -0.9kg in the topiramate group and -0.2kg in the flunarizine plus topiramate group.</s><s>Therefore this study aimed to evaluate the effects of exercise in migraine prevention. Ninety-one patients were randomized and included in the intention-to-treat analysis. The primary efficacy variable showed a mean reduction of 0.93 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31-1.54) attacks in the exercise group, 0.83 (95% CI 0.22-1.45) attacks in the relaxation group, and 0.97 (95% CI 0.36-1.58) attacks in the topiramate group.</s><s>The study sought to evaluate whether topiramate prevents development of chronic daily headache (CDH, ≥15 headache days per month) in adult subjects with high-frequency episodic migraine (HFEM, 9-14 migraine headache days/month). A secondary objective was to assess the efficacy of topiramate as preventive migraine treatment in this population. A total of 159 topiramate subjects and 171 placebo subjects were efficacy-evaluable. Compared with placebo, topiramate treatment was associated with statistically significant reductions in mean number of migraine days (6.6 vs. 5.3/28 days; p = .001) and headache days (6.6 vs 5.3/28 days; p = .001). Topiramate was effective in reducing headache days and migraine headache days and generally well tolerated.</s><s>The primary objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of topiramate and amitriptyline in the prophylaxis of episodic migraine headache. This was a 26-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group noninferiority study. The primary efficacy outcome was the change from prospective baseline in the mean monthly number of migraine episodes. Secondary efficacy variables included changes from the prospective baseline phase to the end of the double-blind phase in the mean monthly (28-day) rate of days with migraine, mean monthly rate of days with headache (migraine and nonmigraine), mean monthly rate of acute abortive medication use, mean monthly migraine duration, and mean monthly migraine severity. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were monitored through the end of double-blind treatment. There were no significant differences between treatment groups in any of the prespecified secondary outcome measures. Subjects receiving topiramate had a significantly greater improvement in mean functional disability scores during migraine attacks compared with amitriptyline (LSM change: -0.33 vs -0.19; 95% CI, -0.3 to 0.0; P = 0.040) and in the role function-restrictive, role function-preventive, and emotional function domains of the MSQ (P = 0.012, P = 0.014, and P = 0.029, respectively). TEAEs of mild or moderate severity were reported in 118 subjects (66.7%) in the topiramate group and 112 subjects (66.3%) in the amitriptyline group. Among the most common TEAEs (reported in +/-5% of subjects during the double-blind phase) in the topiramate group were paresthesia (29.9%), fatigue (16.9%), somnolence (11.9%), hypoesthesia (10.7%), and nausea (10.2%).</s><s>The objectives of this paper are to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of topiramate, given at the dose of 100 mg/day, in the prophylactic treatment of migraine. The study was randomised double-blind versus placebo, lasting 16 weeks, and was preceded by a run-in period of 4 weeks. One hundred and fifteen patients were randomly allocated to treatment with topiramate (TPM) or placebo: 35 patients completed the study in the TPM group and 37 patients in the placebo group.</s><s>Topiramate and sodium valporate are anticonvulsants, demonstrated to be effective as monotherapy for migraine prevention in placebo-controlled trials. To compare the relative efficacy of topiramate and sodium valporate in the prevention of migraine. A 24-week, randomized, double-blind, crossover, clinical trial was conducted from October 2003 to September 2004. The second group received sodium valporate (200 mg daily increment over 1 week to 400 mg) for 2 months. Of the 32 patients treated with sodium valporate, the mean standard deviation (SD) of monthly migraine frequency decreased from 5.4 (2.5) to 4.0 (2.8) episode per month, headache intensity from 7.7 (1.2) to 5.8 (1.7) by visual analog scale (VAS), and headache duration from 21.3 (14.6) to 12.3 (10.7) hours (P < .001). This study demonstrates that treatment with topiramate and sodium valporate both significantly reduce migraine headache. This effect of topiramate and sodium valporate has previously been shown to reduce migraine headache, and we postulate that treatment with topiramate and sodium valporate may have a similar benefit.</s><s>Open-label trials and small controlled studies report topiramate's efficacy in migraine prevention. To assess the efficacy and safety of topiramate as a migraine-preventive therapy. The primary efficacy assessment was a reduction in mean monthly migraine frequency across the 6-month treatment phase. Secondary end points were responder rate, time to onset of action, mean change in migraine days per month, and mean change in rescue medication days per month. Four hundred eighty-seven patients were randomized, and 469 composed the intent-to-treat population.</s><s>To evaluate the efficacy of topiramate in the preventative treatment of episodic migraine. Antiepileptic agents have demonstrated efficacy in migraine prevention, and open-label experience from our clinic has suggested that topiramate might be effective for this use. Forty patients, aged 19 to 62 years (mean, 38.2 years), were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive topiramate (n = 19; all women) or placebo (n = 21; 20 women, 1 man). During the entire double-blind phase, topiramate-treated patients experienced a significantly lower 28-day migraine frequency (3.31 +/- 1.7 versus 3.83 +/- 2.1; P =.002) compared to placebo, irrespective of use of concomitant migraine prevention medications. The mean dose of topiramate was 125 mg per day (range, 25 to 200 mg per day). Topiramate was well tolerated; 2 of 19 topiramate-treated patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Preventative therapy with topiramate significantly reduced migraine frequency.</s><s>Several large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials have found topiramate (TPM) to be effective and generally well tolerated as a preventive therapy for migraine. The double-blind treatment phase consisted of an 8-week titration period (25 mg/d for the first week, followed by weekly increases of 25 mg) and a 12-week maintenance period. The primary efficacy measure was the change in mean monthly migraine frequency. Additional measures were the median percent reduction in monthly migraine frequency and the proportion of responders (those with > or =50%, > or =75%, or 100% reduction in monthly migraine frequency). The intent-to-treat (ITT) population included 211 subjects (138 TPM, 73 placebo; mean [SD] mean weight, 76.7 [18.7] kg). Of 45 subjects who discontinued the study in the TPM group, 21 discontinued during the titration period, compared with 3 of 13 subjects who discontinued in the placebo group. A post hoc analysis using a Poisson regression model in the ITT population suggested that TPM significantly reduced mean monthly migraine frequency compared with placebo (P=0.04).</s>"
