You will be provided with a synthesized summary created from the abstracts of multiple research papers in the biomedical domain.

Your task is to rate the summary on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Conciseness(1-5) - The summarizer refrains from incorporating information outside the keyfacts in the output, maintaining a succinct and focused summary.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Carefully read the provided abstracts from the biomedical research papers. Identify the key facts and essential points.
2. Read the synthesized summary and assess whether it stays focused on these key facts without including unnecessary details or extraneous information.
3. Evaluate the summary's conciseness by checking if it is clear and succinct, ensuring that it captures the necessary information in a compact form.
