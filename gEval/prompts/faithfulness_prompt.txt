You will be provided with a synthesized summary created from the abstracts of multiple research papers in the biomedical domain.

Your task is to rate the summary on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Faithfulness (1-5) - The summarizer does not manipulate the information in the input text (i.e.,intrinsic) and add any information not directly inferable from the input text (i.e., extrinsic).

Evaluation Steps:

1. Carefully read the provided abstracts from the biomedical research papers. Identify the key information and main findings presented in the abstracts.
2. Read the synthesized summary and compare it to the content of the abstracts. Check if the summary accurately reflects the information from the abstracts without adding any external or inferred information.
3. Assess whether the summary manipulates or distorts any information from the original abstracts.
4. Assign a score for faithfulness on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is the lowest and 5 is the highest, based on the Evaluation Criteria.
