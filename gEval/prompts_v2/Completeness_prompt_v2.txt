You will be provided with three inputs: the original abstracts (Source Text) from biomedical research papers, a synthesized summary (Summary), and a reference summary (Target Summary).

Your task is to rate the completeness of the synthesized summary (Summary) in relation to the Target Summary.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Completeness(1-5) - The summarizer ensures the inclusion of all keyfacts from the input text in the output summary.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Carefully read the provided abstracts from the biomedical research papers. Identify all the key facts and main points presented in the abstracts.
2. Read the synthesized summary and compare it to both the original abstracts and the target summary. Check if the synthesized summary includes all the essential facts and information from the abstracts and aligns with the key points outlined in the target summary, ensuring no crucial details are omitted.
3. Evaluate whether the synthesized summary captures the complete scope of the input text and the target summary, ensuring no important facts are left out and that it aligns closely with the target summary's coverage.
4. Assign a score for completeness on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is the lowest and 5 is the highest, based on the Evaluation Criteria.
