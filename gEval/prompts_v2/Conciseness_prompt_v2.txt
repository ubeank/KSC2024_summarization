You will be provided with three inputs: the original abstracts (Source Text) from biomedical research papers, a synthesized summary (Summary), and a reference summary (Target Summary).

Your task is to rate the conciseness of the synthesized summary (Summary) in relation to the Target Summary.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Conciseness(1-5) - The summarizer refrains from incorporating information outside the keyfacts in the output, maintaining a succinct and focused summary.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Carefully read the provided abstracts from the biomedical research papers. Identify the key facts and essential points.
2. Read the synthesized summary and compare it to both the original abstracts and the target summary. Assess whether the synthesized summary remains focused on the key facts highlighted in the target summary, without including unnecessary details or extraneous information.
3. Evaluate the summary's conciseness by checking if it is clear, succinct, and closely aligned with the target summary in capturing the necessary information in a compact form.
4. Assign a score for conciseness on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is the lowest and 5 is the highest, based on the Evaluation Criteria.
