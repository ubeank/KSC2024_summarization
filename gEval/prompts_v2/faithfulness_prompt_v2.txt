You will be provided with three inputs: the original abstracts (Source Text) from biomedical research papers, a synthesized summary (Summary), and a reference summary (Target Summary).

Your task is to rate the Faithfulness of the synthesized summary (Summary) in relation to the Target Summary.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Faithfulness (1-5) - The summarizer does not manipulate the information in the input text (i.e.,intrinsic) and add any information not directly inferable from the input text (i.e., extrinsic).

Evaluation Steps:

1. Carefully read the provided abstracts from the biomedical research papers. Identify the key information and main findings presented in the abstracts.
2. Read the synthesized summary and compare it to both the content of the abstracts and the target summary. Ensure that the synthesized summary accurately reflects the information from the abstracts and aligns with the main points and findings in the target summary, without adding any external or inferred information.
3. Assess whether the summary accurately conveys the information from the original abstracts and target summary without manipulating or distorting any details.
4. Assign a score for faithfulness on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is the lowest and 5 is the highest, based on the Evaluation Criteria.
