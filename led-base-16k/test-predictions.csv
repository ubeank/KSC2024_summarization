456,CD003427,"Prophylactic penicillin in children with sickle cell disease reduces the risk of S.pneumoniae and septicemia, but there is insufficient evidence to support its use in adults. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to assess the effects of prophylaxis on mortality, morbidity and adverse events in adults and children."
457,CD008253,"Betamethasone nasal drops are effective in reducing polyp size in people with cystic fibrosis. However, there is a need for further large randomised controlled trials with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these drops.

458,CD000948,There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine the relative benefits and harms of orotracheal versus nasotracheal intubation in neonates requiring ventilatory support. There is a need for large randomised trials to evaluate the effects of different routes of intubations for neonates with respiratory or cardiac instability.
459,CD003120,"There is some evidence that Ginkgo biloba is an effective treatment for mild to moderate dementia. However, the evidence is not strong enough to recommend its use as a treatment for other types of dementia. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dose and route of administration of this drug, and the optimal duration of therapy."
460,CD003581,"There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of preterm birth prevention programs in the county of Los Angeles. Further trials are needed to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these programs and to determine whether they have an effect on the risk of Preterm birth in the general population.

461,CD003200,"There is some evidence to support the use of graded exercise therapy in the management of chronic fatigue syndrome. However, the evidence is not strong enough to recommend its use as a standard treatment for CFS. Further research is needed to determine whether graded exercise is more effective than placebo in the treatment of CFS, and whether it has an effect on mood."
462,CD000536,There is insufficient evidence to determine whether anticoagulants given to patients undergoing peripheral arterial bypass surgery improve survival or reduce mortality. There is a need for larger randomised controlled trials to evaluate the effects of anticoabulants on mortality and morbidity in patients undergoing bypass surgery. These trials should include patients with high risk of haemorrhage.
463,CD000146,"Nicotine replacement therapy is effective in promoting smoking cessation in people with a high level of nicotine dependence. Adequately powered trials with low risk of bias are needed to determine the efficacy of this intervention.

464,CD007986,"There is currently insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of omega-6 fatty acids in children with ADHD.

465,CD001815,"There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of antibiotics in the treatment of preterm infants with feeding intolerance. Further randomised controlled trials with low risk of bias are needed. Such trials should assess the effects of antibiotics on mortality, morbidity and development of feeding intolerance in preterm and extremely low birth weight infants.

466,CD004447,There is insufficient evidence to determine whether or not IGF-I deficiency or deficiency is associated with short stature in people with X-linked hypophosphatemia. Further research is required to determine if IGF-1 deficiency is an underlying cause of short stature and whether IGF-2 deficiency is a contributory factor in the short stature of people with this condition.
467,CD003700,"There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of vitamin A as a treatment for pneumonia in children aged less than 12 years of age. There is a need for high quality randomised controlled trials with adequate power to detect clinically important differences in mortality, duration of hospitalisation and morbidity and mortality, and to evaluate the effect of vitaminA on adverse events in children with pneumonia."
468,CD003412,"Imiquimod 5% cream appears to be effective in the treatment of superficial BCC. It is unclear whether it has an effect on the recurrence of primary or recurrent tumours, but it appears to have an impact on the clearance of secondary tumours. The results of this review should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of included studies and the possibility of publication bias."
