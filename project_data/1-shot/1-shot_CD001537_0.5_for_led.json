        "SummarizedAbstracts": "<s>The effectiveness of intravenous methylprednisolone pulses in 20 mg/kg/day for three consecutive days was compared with a more conventional oral prednisone regime in inducing remission in adult patients presenting with first episodes of minimal change nephrotic syndrome. Of the six non-responders to methylprednisolone five subsequently remitted with oral prednisone, and one with cyclophosphamide.</s><s>In a multicentre, randomised, prospective trial 89 patients (67 children and 22 adults) with the minimal change nephrotic syndrome were treated with three intravenous pulses of methylprednisolone followed by low dose oral prednisone for six months (group given methylprednisolone) or with high dose oral prednisone for four weeks followed by low dose oral prednisone for five months (control group). Five patients in the group given methylprednisolone and one in the control group did not respond initially. The time to response was shorter in children treated with methylprednisolone. These data suggest that a short course of methylprednisolone pulses followed by low dose oral prednisone is only marginally less effective than a regimen of high dose oral steroids but can improve the ratio of risk to benefit associated with treatment of the minimal change nephrotic syndrome.</s><s>Adult minimal change nephropathy: experience of the collaborative study of glomerular disease.</s>"
