Although daily monitoring of the 35 participants revealed an association between RH administration (100 mg twice a day) and the development of nausea and anxiety (P less than 0.05), these and other potential side effects were transient and were rarely considered to be clinically significant.</s><s>Therapeutic effectiveness of amantadine hydrochloride in naturally occurring Hong Kong influenza--double-blind studies.</s><s>In a boarding school for boys, where routine influenza vaccination is carried out annually, 267 boys were given amantadine (100 mg daily) and 269 received no specific treatment during an influenza A (H1N1) outbreak. There are circumstances when the prophylactic use of amantadine may be justified for the control of influenza A outbreaks in boarding schools and other institutions where high attack-rates are experienced.</s><s>With recent studies suggesting that children are the main introducers of influenza infections into families, we conducted a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial to study the prophylactic effectiveness of rimantadine hydrochloride in children on the transmission of influenza A infections within families. One hundred forty-five volunteers from 35 families completed this study during a naturally occurring outbreak of influenza A (H1N1) infection. Clinical illness with laboratory evidence of influenza infection occurred in 17.0% of children in the placebo group and 0% of children in the rimantadine group. Rimantadine was well tolerated by the children, with no significant difference in reported side effects between the placebo and rimantadine groups. On the basis of our study, rimantadine prophylaxis of children appears to be an effective method to prevent influenza A infection in children.</s><s>The safety and efficacy of rimantadine for long-term prophylaxis of influenza A (H3N2) infection were evaluated among elderly residents in 10 nursing homes. Within each nursing home, participating residents were randomly assigned to receive placebo or rimantadine at 100 or 200 mg/day. Residents were evaluated daily for symptoms and significant health events as possible side effects, as well as for influenza-like illness. However, residents in the active medication groups were more likely to withdraw from the study and to experience various health events including death; some but not all of these differences were statistically significant. The results suggest the relative safety and clinical efficacy of using rimantadine for influenza prophylaxis among vaccinated elderly individuals and support the recommendation for a dosage reduction to 100 mg/day in this population.</s><s>Despite vaccination, influenza commonly causes morbidity and mortality in institutional settings. This double-blind, randomized, controlled study prospectively enrolled nursing home residents for 3 influenza seasons (1997 to 2000). Following influenza outbreak declaration, subjects were randomized to inhaled zanamivir 10 mg or standard of care (rimantadine 100 mg for influenza A or placebo for influenza B) once daily for 14 days. The proportion of randomized subjects developing symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed influenza during prophylaxis was the primary endpoint. Of 482 randomizations (238 zanamivir, 231 rimantadine, 13 placebo), 96% of subjects were elderly or had high-risk conditions; over 90% were vaccinated. Zanamivir prevents symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed influenza more effectively than rimantadine, is unassociated with resistant virus, and has a favorable safety profile.</s><s>Treatment with rimantadine of influenza in children and the potential development of resistance in clinical isolates associated with therapy have not been previously studied. We compared rimantadine to acetaminophen therapy in a controlled, double-blind study of 91 children with influenza-like illness. During the seven-day study, of the 22 children in the rimantadine group with serial isolates tested, ten (45.5%) had resistant isolates compared with two (12.5%) of those with serial isolates in the acetaminophen group (P less than .03). Furthermore, the mean inhibitory concentration of rimantadine increased with time in the rimantadine group (r = .4, P = .002) but not in the acetaminophen group. Rimantadine therapy, thus, appears to be significantly more effective than acetaminophen in ameliorating the clinical signs and symptoms of influenza in children. Treatment with rimantadine was also associated with increased viral shedding after the medication was discontinued and with the development of resistance in the clinical isolates, the significance of which is unknown.</s><s>Despite vaccination, influenza remains a common of morbidity in nursing homes. In a randomized, unblinded pilot study, we compared 14 day chemoprophylaxis with zanamivir, an antiviral which inhibits influenza neuraminidase, to standard of care during sequential influenza A and influenza B outbreaks in a 735 bed nursing home. Sixty-five volunteers on four epidemic units were randomized to zanamivir and on two epidemic units, 23 volunteers were randomized to rimantadine. During the 14 days of prophylaxis, only four new febrile respiratory illnesses were detected. One volunteer receiving rimantadine prophylaxis developed laboratory-confirmed influenza.</s><s>A field trial of amantadine prophylaxis in naturally-occurring acute respiratory illness.</s><s>In a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial, we evaluated the prophylactic effectiveness of rimantadine in children (ages 1 to 18 years) against infection with influenza A (H3N2) and associated illness and the prevention of transmission of infection to adult members of the child's family. Influenza infections, defined as a positive viral throat culture or a 4-fold increase in antibody titer, occurred in 31.0% of children in the placebo group and 7.4% in the rimantadine group (P = 0.026). Rimantadine was well-tolerated by the children, with no significant difference in reported adverse effects between the placebo and rimantadine groups.</s><s>The effects of rimantadine on lymphocyte responses to mitogens CON-A and PHA, natural killer cell activity, and the development of serum and local antibodies were studied during an epidemic outbreak of influenza A (H3N2). However, the presence of IgA in nasal secretions was significantly diminished in the rimantadine group compared to the placebo group (0/9 vs. 6/9, P less than 0.005). The findings indicate that rimantadine had no adverse affect on the systemic immune system. However, local immune response was diminished in individuals taking rimantadine possibly due to the presence of less immunogen resulting from reduction of virus in secretions of individuals taking antivirals.</s>"
