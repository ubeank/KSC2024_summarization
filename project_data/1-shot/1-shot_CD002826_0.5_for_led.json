        "SummarizedAbstracts": "<s>The effect of active hand exercise and warm wax treatment was evaluated in 52 rheumatoid arthritis patients randomized into four groups: (1) both exercise and wax bath, (2) exercise only, (3) wax bath only, and (4) controls. Deficits in flexion and extension in digits II-V bilaterally, grip function, grip strength, pain, and stiffness were measured before and after the treatment period. Active hand exercise alone reduced stiffness and pain with nonresisted motion and increased ROM.</s><s>Heat and cold in the physical treatment of rheumatoid arthritis of the knee. A controlled clinical trial.</s><s>Ninety consecutive patients undergoing primary knee arthroplasty received local cryotherapy 72 hours after surgery for pain relief. The amount of morphine injected was positively correlated to the number of attempts per hour and moderately correlated to body weight.</s><s>Use of cryotherapy on the postsurgical rheumatoid hand.</s>"
