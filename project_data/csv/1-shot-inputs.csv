21917,CD002826,1390969,Effect of active hand exercise and wax bath treatment in rheumatoid arthritis patients.,"The effect of active hand exercise and warm wax treatment was evaluated in 52 rheumatoid arthritis patients randomized into four groups: (1) both exercise and wax bath, (2) exercise only, (3) wax bath only, and (4) controls. Treatment was given three times a week for 4 weeks. Deficits in flexion and extension in digits II-V bilaterally, grip function, grip strength, pain, and stiffness were measured before and after the treatment period. The control group was measured at corresponding times. Wax bath treatment followed by active hand exercise resulted in significant improvements of range of motion (ROM) and grip function. Active hand exercise alone reduced stiffness and pain with nonresisted motion and increased ROM. Wax bath alone had no significant effect."

Thermal-pad circulating temperatures were randomly assigned to 50 degrees, 60 degrees, or 70 degrees F (room temperature). Pain relief was monitored using patient-controlled analgesia machines. The amount of morphine received and number of attempts per hour were statistically analyzed with relation to temperature group, age, sex, weight, side, and diagnosis. The amount of morphine injected was positively correlated to the number of attempts per hour and moderately correlated to body weight. There was no correlation between thermal-pad temperature or any other parameter and the amount of morphine injected after surgery."
