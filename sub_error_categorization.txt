You will be provided with three inputs: the source text, the synthesized summary (Summary), and the reference summary (Target Summary).

Your task is to categorize the potential errors in the synthesized summary (Summary) into three main categories: Faithfulness, Completeness, and Conciseness. Additionally, for each identified error, you will need to specify its corresponding sub error category to provide a more granular breakdown of the errors.

Main error Categories:
1. Faithfulness - The summarizer does not manipulate the information in the input text (i.e.,intrinsic) and add any information not directly inferable from the input text (i.e., extrinsic).
2. Completeness - The summarizer ensures the inclusion of all keyfacts from the input text in the output summary. 
3. Conciseness - The summarizer refrains from incorporating information outside the keyfacts in the output, maintaining a succinct and focused summary.

Follow these steps to complete the task:
1. Carefully read the source text and identify the key facts and main points.
2. Read the synthesized summary (Summary) and compare it to the reference summary (Target Summary). Use the following questions to identify errors in each category: Faithfulness, Completeness, Conciseness
3. For each error identified, record the main error category and its corresponding sub error category. Provide a brief explanation for why the error falls under that category.
